            <h2>Deep learning approach for flow visualization in background-oriented schlieren</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viren S. Ram, Tullio de Rubeis, Dario Ambrosini, Rajshekhar Gannavarpu</p>
            <p>Diffractive optical element based background oriented schlieren (BOS) is a popular technique for quantitative flow visualization. This technique relies on encoding spatial density variations of the test medium in the form of an optical fringe pattern; and hence, its accuracy is directly influenced by the quality of fringe pattern demodulation. We introduce a robust deep learning assisted subspace method which enables reliable fringe pattern demodulation even in the presence of severe noise and uneven fringe distortions in recorded BOS fringe patterns. The method's effectiveness to handle fringe pattern artifacts is demonstrated via rigorous numerical simulations. Furthermore, the method's practical applicability is experimentally validated using real-world BOS images obtained from a liquid diffusion process.</p>

            <h2>A Graph-based Hybrid Beamforming Framework for MIMO Cell-Free ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanan Du, Sai Xu, Jagmohan Chauhan</p>
            <p>This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach, while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.</p>

            <h2>Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Incidents and Congestion with Implications for Sustainable Traffic Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tony Kinchen, Ting Bai, Nishanth Venkatesh S., Andreas A. Malikopoulos</p>
            <p>Urban traffic anomalies such as collisions and disruptions threaten the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. We present a simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this dataset, we develop a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks with a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies. Our simulation studies on the Broadway corridor in New York City demonstrate the framework's ability to reproduce consistent incident conditions, quantify their effects, and provide accurate multi-horizon traffic forecasts. Our results highlight the value of combining controlled anomaly generation with deep predictive models to support reproducible evaluation and sustainable traffic management.</p>

            <h2>From Legacy to Leadership Intelligent Radio Network Planning Framework for Cell-Free Massive MIMO in B5G6G Era</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valdemar Farré, David Vega, Juan Estrada, Juan A. Vásquez Peralvo, Symeon Chatzinotas</p>
            <p>The proliferation of cell-free Massive MIMO represents a transformative shift in wireless network architecture, addressing critical limitations of conventional distributed Massive MIMO systems. This paper presents an intelligent radio network planning framework that bridges legacy 5G infrastructures with future B5G/6G networks through cell-free architectures. By leveraging operational insights from existing 5G deployments, we systematically address coverage optimization, and capacity enhancement. Our scalable framework enables seamless evolution from legacy designs to next-generation cell-free systems. Through extensive simulations in dense urban environments, we demonstrate substantial improvements: 45% spectral efficiency gains, 30% interference reduction, and significantly enhanced uniform coverage. The proposed framework provides network operators with a practical roadmap for transitioning from traditional cellular architectures to demanding B5G/6G requirements while maximizing existing infrastructure investments.</p>

            <h2>Digital Twin Aided Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Exploring the Impact of Twinning Fidelity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Luo, Shuaifeng Jiang, Saeed R. Khosravirad, Ahmed Alkhateeb</p>
            <p>Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments, we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity, especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.</p>

            <h2>Joint Communications, Sensing, and Positioning in 6G Multi-Functional Satellite Systems: Survey and Open Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chandan Kumar Sheemar, Jorge Querol, Wali Ullah Khan, Prabhu Thiruvasagam, Sourabh Solanki, Idir Edjekouane, Alejandro Gonzalez-Garrido, Mohammed Al-Ansi, Carla E. Garcia, Symeon Chatzinotas</p>
            <p>Satellite systems are expected to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous coverage and supporting a wide range of services across communications, sensing, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed, covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT (JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges, including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) for the 6G and beyond space era.</p>

            <h2>Assessment of East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) facing Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic Modules for Agrivoltaics and Dual-Land Use Applications in India</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishant Kumar, Shravan Kumar Singh, Nikhil Chander</p>
            <p>Deploying vertical bifacial PV modules can play a significant role in agrivoltaics, fencing walls, noise barriers, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar PV for electric vehicles, and many other applications. This research work presents the performance comparison of vertical bifacial photovoltaic (VBPV) modules facing East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) directions. Also, the VBPV modules are compared with vertical and tilted south-facing monofacial PV modules. Six PV modules (monofacial and bifacial) were installed at the rooftop of IIT Bhilai academic building, Raipur (21.16° N, 81.65° E), India, and studied for a year from May 2022 to April 2023. The results show that the E-W facing VBPV module gives two production peaks, one in the morning and another in the evening, as compared to the single notable rise at midday observed for a monofacial module. From a series of experiments, 19 days of data were collected over the one-year period from May 2022 to April 2023, with specific inclusion of important days like solstices and equinoxes. In addition, the energy generation results are compared with PVsyst simulations, while also addressing the limitations of the PVsyst simulation of vertical PV modules. E-W bifacial generation is higher than S-N bifacial and south-facing monofacial modules from February to April. The VBPV modules in E-W and S-N orientations present a promising opportunity for expanding the agrivoltaics sector in tropical and sub-tropical countries, like India. This has huge implications for addressing the sustainable development goals by simultaneously contributing to sustainable land management, green energy generation, energy security and water conservation in the vast geo-climatic expanse of tropics.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Rate Manipulation Attacks on Power Grid Security</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonatan Gizachew Achamyeleh, Yang Xiang, Yun-Ping Hsiao, Yasamin Moghaddas, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque</p>
            <p>The growing complexity of global supply chains has made hardware Trojans a significant threat in sensor-based power electronics. Traditional Trojan designs depend on digital triggers or fixed threshold conditions that can be detected during standard testing. In contrast, we introduce Environmental Rate Manipulation (ERM), a novel Trojan triggering mechanism that activates by monitoring the rate of change in environmental parameters rather than their absolute values. This approach allows the Trojan to remain inactive under normal conditions and evade redundancy and sensor-fusion defenses. We implement a compact 14~$\mu$m$^2$ circuit that measures capacitor charging rates in standard sensor front-ends and disrupts inverter pulse-width modulation PWM signals when a rapid change is induced. Experiments on a commercial Texas Instruments solar inverter demonstrate that ERM can trigger catastrophic driver chip failure. Furthermore, ETAP simulations indicate that a single compromised 100~kW inverter may initiate cascading grid instabilities. The attack's significance extends beyond individual sensors to entire classes of environmental sensing systems common in power electronics, demonstrating fundamental challenges for hardware security.</p>

            <h2>Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rangrang Zheng, Greg Schivley, Matthias Fripp, Michael J. Roberts</p>
            <p>Expanding interregional transmission is widely viewed as essential for integrating clean energy into decarbonized power systems. Using the open-source Switch capacity expansion model with detailed representation of existing U.S. generation and transmission infrastructure, solar, wind, and storage resources, and hourly operations, we evaluate the role of transmission across least-cost, socially optimal, and zero-emissions scenarios for 2050. An optimal nationwide plan would more than triple interregional transmission capacity, yet this reduces the cost of a zero-emissions system by only 7% relative to relying on existing transmission, as storage, solar and wind siting, and nuclear generation serve as close substitutes. Regional cost and rent effects vary, with transmission generally favoring wind and hydrogen resources over solar and batteries. Sensitivity analysis shows diminishing returns: one-fifth of the benefits of full expansion can be achieved with one-twelfth of the added capacity, while cost reductions for batteries and hydrogen provide comparable or greater system savings than transmission. Reconductoring -- quadrupling line capacity at half the cost of new builds achieves nearly all the benefits of unconstrained expansion. These results suggest that while substantial transmission expansion is economically justified, a diverse set of flexibility resources can substitute for large-scale grid build-out, and the relative value of transmission is highly contingent on technological and cost developments.</p>

            <h2>Rebuild AC Power Flow Models with Graph Attention Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuting Hu, Jinjun Xiong</p>
            <p>A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.</p>

            <h2>Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Hu, Zheyuan Cheng</p>
            <p>Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Security Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow Using General Polynomial Chaos Expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ghulam Mohy-ud-din, Yunqi Wang, Rahmat Heidari, Frederik Geth</p>
            <p>Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.</p>

            <h2>Incorporating flexibility and resilience demand into capacity market considering the guidance on generation investment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunpeng Xiao, Hui Guo, Wenqi Wu, Xiuli Wang, Xifan Wang</p>
            <p>The capacity market provides economic guidance for generation investment and ensures the adequacy of generation capability for power systems. With the rapidly increasing proportion of renewable energy, the adequacy of flexibility and resilience becomes more crucial for the secure operation of power systems. In this context, this paper incorporates the flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market by formulating the capacity demand curves for ramping capability, inertia and recovery capabilities besides the generation capability. The guidance on generation investment of the capacity market is also taken into account by solving the generation investment equilibrium among generation companies with a Nash Cournot model employing an equivalent quadratic programming formulation. The overall problem is established as a trilevel game and an iterative algorithm is devised to formulate the capacity demand curves in the upper level based on Genco's investment acquired from the middle and lower levels. The case study further demonstrates that to incorporate flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market could stimulate proper generation investment and ensure the adequacy of flexibility and resilience in power systems.</p>

            <h2>Electric Vehicle Charger Infrastructure Planning: Demand Estimation, Coverage Optimization Over an Integrated Power Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshal D. Kaushik, Jingbo Wang, Roshni Anna Jacob, Jie Zhang</p>
            <p>For electrifying the transportation sector, deploying a strategically planned and efficient charging infrastructure is essential. This paper presents a two-phase approach for electric vehicle (EV) charger deployment that integrates spatial point-of-interest analysis and maximum coverage optimization over an integrated spatial power grid. Spatial-focused studies in the literature often overlook electrical grid constraints, while grid-focused work frequently considers statistically modeled EV charging demand. To address these gaps, a new framework is proposed that combines spatial network planning with electrical grid considerations. This study approaches EV charger planning from a perspective of the distribution grid, starting with an estimation of EV charging demand and the identification of optimal candidate locations. It ensures that the capacity limits of newly established chargers are maintained within the limits of the power grid. This framework is applied in a test case for the Dallas area, integrating the existing EV charger network with an 8500-bus distribution system for comprehensive planning.</p>

            <h2>Solar and Wind Power Forecasting: A Comparative Review of LSTM, Random Forest, and XGBoost Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsaneh Mollasalehi, Armin Farhadi</p>
            <p>Rising global energy demand from population growth raises concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels. Consequently, the energy sector has increasingly transitioned to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are naturally abundant. However, the periodic and unpredictable nature of these resources pose significant challenges for power system reliability. Accurate forecasting is essential to ensure grid stability and optimize energy management. But due to the high variability in weather conditions which directly affected wind and solar energy, achieving precise predictions remains difficult. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), offer promising solutions to improve forecasting accuracy. The study highlights three widely used algorithms for solar and wind energy prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models are capable of learning complex patterns from historical and environmental data, enabling more accurate forecasts and contributing to the enhanced efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems. This review aims to provide an overview on RF, XGBoost, and LSTM by conducting a comparative analysis across three essential criteria: research prevalence, model complexity, and computational execution time.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated vs. Sequential Transmission Planning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maya Domeshek, Christoph Graf, Burçin Ünel</p>
            <p>Coordinated planning of generation, storage, and transmission more accurately captures the interactions among these three capacity types necessary to meet electricity demand, at least in theory. However, in practice, U.S. system operators typically follow a sequential planning approach: They first determine future generation and storage additions based on an assumed unconstrained (`copper plate') system. Next, they perform dispatch simulations of this projected generation and storage capacity mix on the existing transmission grid to identify transmission constraint violations. These violations indicate the need for transmission upgrades. We describe a multistage, multi-locational planning model that co-optimizes generation, storage, and transmission investments. The model respects reliability constraints as well as state energy and climate policies. We test the two planning approaches using a current stakeholder-informed 20-zone model of the PJM region, developed for the current FERC Order No. 1920 compliance filing process. In our most conservative model specification, we find that the co-optimized approach estimates 67% lower transmission upgrade needs than the sequential model, leading to total system costs that are .6% lower and similar reliability and climate outcomes. Our sensitivities show larger transmission and cost savings and reliability and climate benefits from co-optimized planning.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven Optimal Power Flow: A Behavioral Systems Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Otzen, Hannes M. H. Wolf, Christian A. Hans</p>
            <p>The increasing decentralization of power systems driven by a large number of renewable energy sources poses challenges in power flow optimization. Partially unknown power line properties can render model-based approaches unsuitable. With increasing deployment of sensors, data-driven methods rise as a promising alternative. They offer the flexibility to adapt to varying grid structures and unknown line properties. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven representation of nonlinear power flow equations for radial grids based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma. The approach allows for direct integration of input/output data into power flow optimisation, enabling cost minimization and constraint enforcement without requiring explicit knowledge of the electrical properties or the topology of the grid. Moreover, we formulate a convex relaxation to ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art solvers. In a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the novel approach performs similar to state-of-the-art methods, without the need for an explicit system identification step.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Speech Watermarking for Speech Synthesis via Progressive Knowledge Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Cui, Peter Pan, Lei He, Sheng Zhao</p>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of speech generative models, unauthorized voice cloning poses significant privacy and security risks. Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.</p>

            <h2>Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Heng Chou</p>
            <p>Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.</p>

            <p>An experimental study on magnetic near-field (NF) scanning of printed circuit board (PCB) emission radiation is developed in this paper. The design and installation of the electromagnetic (EM) NF scanner is introduced. The test bed of magnetic NF emission in the microwave frequency range is described. The methodology of the microstrip magnetic NF probe is discussed. The probe calibration process was performed following the IEC 61967-1 NF scanning standard. The NF scanner functioning is tested with passive microstrip circuit square loop probe and device under test (DUT) PCB radiation in the test plan positioned at 1-mm above the ground plane. Based on the standard test with I-shape 50-$\Omega$ transmission line (TL), the calibration process of radiated magnetic field was validated by comparison between HFSS__ simulation and experimentation in very wideband frequency from 0.1-GHz to 3-GHz. Then, a nonstandard TL based DUT was experimented. Accordingly, the cartographies of scanned magnetic NF at two different test frequencies, 2 GHz and 3 GHz, are discussed. The NF scanner is under development for targeting the EMC radiated emission of PCB dedicated to operate in 6G wireless communication.</p>

            <h2>Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Yin, Li Qiao, Yu Ma, Shuo Sun, Kan Li, Zhen Gao, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR > 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.</p>

            <h2>Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Robert Calderbank</p>
            <p>Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.</p>

            <h2>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhe Zhang, Qiang Chen, Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Aware Decentralized Sinkhorn for Wasserstein Barycenters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Baheri, David Millard, Alireza Vahid</p>
            <p>Distributed systems require fusing heterogeneous local probability distributions into a global summary over sparse and unreliable communication networks. Traditional consensus algorithms, which average distributions in Euclidean space, ignore their inherent geometric structure, leading to misleading results. Wasserstein barycenters offer a geometry-aware alternative by minimizing optimal transport costs, but their entropic approximations via the Sinkhorn algorithm typically require centralized coordination. This paper proposes a fully decentralized Sinkhorn algorithm that reformulates the centralized geometric mean as an arithmetic average in the log-domain, enabling approximation through local gossip protocols. Agents exchange log-messages with neighbors, interleaving consensus phases with local updates to mimic centralized iterations without a coordinator. To optimize bandwidth, we integrate event-triggered transmissions and b-bit quantization, providing tunable trade-offs between accuracy and communication while accommodating asynchrony and packet loss. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence to a neighborhood of the centralized entropic barycenter, with bias linearly dependent on consensus tolerance, trigger threshold, and quantization error. Complexity scales near-linearly with network size. Simulations confirm near-centralized accuracy with significantly fewer messages, across various topologies and conditions.</p>

            <p>Paralinguistic sounds, like laughter and sighs, are crucial for synthesizing more realistic and engaging speech. However, existing methods typically depend on proprietary datasets, while publicly available resources often suffer from incomplete speech, inaccurate or missing timestamps, and limited real-world relevance. To address these problems, we propose an automated framework for generating large-scale paralinguistic data and apply it to construct the SynParaSpeech dataset. The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with 118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving paralinguistic event detection.

            <h2>Generalized Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architectures: Theory and Design via Structure-oriented Symmetric Unitary Projection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohua Zhou, Tianyu Fang, Yijie Mao, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead), and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high efficiency.</p>

            <p>Pediatric brain tumor segmentation presents unique challenges due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these malignancies, yet remains critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose an ensemble approach integrating nnU-Net, Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net for the BraTS-PED 2025 challenge.

Our final ensemble combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 72.3% (ET), 95.6% (NET), 68.9% (CC), 89.5% (ED), 92.3% (TC), and 92.3% (WT), respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianqian Li, Hua Li, Shiya Hao, Lintao Li, Xiaoming Dai</p>
            <p>This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marko Fidanovski, Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.</p>

Free parameters provide flexibility for modeling complex growth in industrial, medical, and social systems. The Hybrid Sumudu Variational (HSV) method is employed to efficiently obtain semi-analytical solutions. Results highlight the combined effects of fractional order and delay on system behavior.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariana Álvarez, Alexander Alegría, Andrés Rivera, Sebastián Pedersen</p>
            <p>This paper presents and discusses a mathematical model inspired by control theory to derive optimal public policies for minimizing costs associated with the reduction and control of criminal activity in a population. Specifically, we analyze the optimal control problem \begin{equation*} \min G(u_1, u_2, u_3) = \int_{0}^{t_{\text{F}}} \left( I(t) - R(t) + \frac{B_1}{2} u_1^2(t) + \frac{B_2}{2} u_2^2(t) + \frac{B_3}{2} u_3^2(t) \right) \, dt. \end{equation*} where $I=I(t)$ and $R=R(t)$ satisfies the system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} \dot{S} &= \Lambda - (1-u_1)SI - \mu S + ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + \rho \Omega R,\\ \dot{I} &= (1-u_1)SI - (\mu + \delta_1)I - ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + (1-\Omega)\rho R,\\ \dot{R} &= ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - (\mu + \delta_2 + \rho)R. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} Our approach assumes that the social and economic effects of criminal behavior can be modeled by a dynamic SIR-type system, which serves as a constraint on a cost functional associated with the strategies implemented by government and law enforcement authorities to reduce criminal behavior. Using optimal control theory, the proposed controls, i.e., preventive policies (such as community and social cohesion programs), are expected to have a significant and positive impact on crime reduction, generating opportunities for the most disadvantaged sectors of Cali society and contributing to long-term security. Given that resources to address this problem are limited, this research aims to determine an optimal combination of public interventions and policies that minimize criminality at the lowest possible economic cost, using an SIR model, tools from variational calculus, and optimal control theory.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Performance Limit for Radar Parameter Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dazhuan Xu, Han Zhang, Nan Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we employ the thoughts and methodologies of Shannon's information theory to solve the problem of the optimal radar parameter estimation. Based on a general radar system model, the \textit{a posteriori} probability density function of targets' parameters is derived. Range information (RI) and entropy error (EE) are defined to evaluate the performance. It is proved that acquiring 1 bit of the range information is equivalent to reducing estimation deviation by half. The closed-form approximation for the EE is deduced in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, which demonstrates that the EE degenerates to the mean square error (MSE) when the SNR is tending to infinity. Parameter estimation theorem is then proved, which claims that the theoretical RI is achievable. The converse claims that there exists no unbiased estimator whose empirical RI is larger than the theoretical RI. Simulation result demonstrates that the theoretical EE is tighter than the commonly used Cramér-Rao bound and the ZivZakai bound.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Maria Nobili, Yuzhen Qin, Carlo Alberto Avizzano, Danielle S. Bassett, Fabio Pasqualetti</p>
            <p>Many natural and man-made network systems need to maintain certain patterns, such as working at equilibria or limit cycles, to function properly. Thus, the ability to stabilize such patterns is crucial. Most of the existing studies on stabilization assume that network systems states can be measured online so that feedback control strategies can be used. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems states, e.g., neuronal activity in the brain, are often difficult to measure. In this paper, we take this situation into account and study the stabilization problem of linear network systems with an open-loop control strategy (vibrational control). We derive a graph-theoretic sufficient condition for structural vibrational stabilizability, under which network systems can always be stabilized. We further provide an approach to select the locations in the network for control placement and design corresponding vibrational inputs to stabilize systems that satisfy this condition. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kushagra Gupta, Xinjie Liu, Ross Allen, Ufuk Topcu, David Fridovich-Keil</p>
            <p>Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with an asymptotic local \textit{linear} convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local \textit{superlinear} convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods with similar guarantees do not offer convergence rates in the nonconvex-nonconcave setting. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.

            <p>This work introduces the M6(GPT)3 composer system, capable of generating complete, multi-minute musical compositions with complex structures in any time signature, in the MIDI domain from input descriptions in natural language. The system utilizes an autoregressive transformer language model to map natural language prompts to composition parameters in JSON format. The defined structure includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody, bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. We propose a genetic algorithm for the generation of melodic elements. The algorithm incorporates mutations with musical significance and a fitness function based on normal distribution and predefined musical feature values. The values adaptively evolve, influenced by emotional parameters and distinct playing styles. The system for generating percussion in any time signature utilises probabilistic methods, including Markov chains. Through both human and objective evaluations, we demonstrate that our music generation approach outperforms baselines on specific, musically meaningful metrics, offering a viable alternative to purely neural network-based systems.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in speech-language models have yielded significant improvements in speech tokenization and synthesis. However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

            <p>It is significant to employ multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</p>

            <h2>Training-Free Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Saberi, Chi Zhang, Mehmet Akçakaya</p>
            <p>Deep learning (DL) methods have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency, we devise a novel mitigation objective that is minimized in a small ball around the attack input. Results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. We also introduce a practically relevant scenario for small adversarial perturbations that models impulse noise in raw data, which relates to \emph{herringbone artifacts}, and show the applicability of our approach in this setting. Finally, we show our mitigation approach remains effective in two \emph{realistic} extension scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy.</p>

            <h2>Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Chandak</p>
            <p>Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</p>

            <h2>LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihe Wang, Nan Huang, Nadia Mammone, Marco Cecchi, Xiang Zhang</p>
            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: this https URL</p>

            <h2>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Donker van Heel, Rutger-Jan Lange, Bram van Os, Dick van Dijk</p>
            <p>Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.</p>

            <h2>GCDance: Genre-Controlled Music-Driven 3D Full Body Dance Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinran Liu, Xu Dong, Shenbin Qian, Diptesh Kanojia, Wenwu Wang, Zhenhua Feng</p>
            <p>Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

            <h2>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harish K. Dureppagari, R. Michael Buehrer, Harpreet S. Dhillon</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</p>

            <h2>Rapidly Converging Time-Discounted Ergodicity on Graphs for Active Inspection of Confined Spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Wong, Ryan H. Lee, Tyler M. Paine, Santosh Devasia, Ashis G. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Ergodic exploration has spawned a lot of interest in mobile robotics due to its ability to design time trajectories that match desired spatial coverage statistics. However, current ergodic approaches are for continuous spaces, which require detailed sensory information at each point and can lead to fractal-like trajectories that cannot be tracked easily. This paper presents a new ergodic approach for graph-based discretization of continuous spaces. It also introduces a new time-discounted ergodicity metric, wherein early visitations of information-rich nodes are weighted more than late visitations. A Markov chain synthesized using a convex program is shown to converge more rapidly to time-discounted ergodicity than the traditional fastest mixing Markov chain. The resultant ergodic traversal method is used within a hierarchical framework for active inspection of confined spaces with the goal of detecting anomalies robustly using SLAM-driven Bayesian hypothesis testing. Experiments on a ground robot show the advantages of this framework over three continuous space ergodic planners as well as greedy and random exploration methods for left-behind foreign object debris detection in a ballast tank.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Bounds for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation with Arbitrary Norm Contractions and Markovian Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Chandak, Shaan Ul Haque, Nicholas Bambos</p>
            <p>Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm with applications in reinforcement learning and optimization. Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.</p>

            <p>Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that our framework can successfully address additional scenarios previously intractable for existing methods - neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators for the purpose of trajectory prediction.</p>

            <p>Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Goksenin Yuksel, Marcel van Gerven, Kiki van der Heijden</p>
            <p>Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned, evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and evidential grounding of the generated responses. Experiments on two out-of-domain datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the resulting model.</p>

            <p>Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks. They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyang Song, Shimin Zhang, Yuhong Chou, Jibin Wu, Haizhou Li</p>
            <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms, represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve competitive performance on large-scale speech processing tasks. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS) mechanism, which simulates multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further integrates a Re-parameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$ respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy efficiency.

            <p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining Bézier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p>

By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.</p>

            <p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p>

            <p>We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian. When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.</p>

            <p>Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p>

Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP), which extends the MLP by attaching an output branch, also called tail, to each hidden layer. Each tail refines the residual between the current prediction and the ground-truth signal, so that the accumulated outputs across layers correspond to the target signals at different LoDs, enabling multi-scale modeling with supervision from only a single-resolution signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T-MLP outperforms existing neural LoD baselines across diverse signal representation tasks.</p>

            <p>There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiqi Xu, Lihao Zhang, Yuyang Du, Qun Yang, Soung Chang Liew</p>
            <p>Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control this http URL this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot this http URL protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.</p>

            <h2>Feature Space Analysis by Guided Diffusion Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimiaki Shirahama, Miki Yanobu, Kaduki Yamashita, Miho Ohsaki</p>
            <p>One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various image attributes are encoded into the user-specified feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keunwoo Choi, Seungheon Doh, Juhan Nam</p>
            <p>We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Xing, Irmak Karaca, Amir Akhavanrezayat, Samira Badrloo, Quan Dong Nguyen, Mahadevan Subramaniam</p>
            <p>We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.</p>

            <p>Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects. Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.</p>

            <p>Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>MindVL: Towards Efficient and Effective Training of Multimodal Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs</h2>

            <p>We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.</p>

            <p>Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.</p>

            <h2>Subspace Clustering of Subspaces: Unifying Canonical Correlation Analysis and Subspace Clustering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paris A. Karakasis, Nicholas D. Sidiropoulos</p>
            <p>We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation of Active Power Oscillation in Multi-VSG Grids: An Impedance-Based Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjie Xiao, Lu Wang, Xiong Du, Pedro Rodriguez, Zian Qin</p>
            <p>Active power oscillations frequently arise in inverter-dominated power systems with multiple converters operating under Virtual Synchronous Generator control, posing risks to system stability and protection coordination. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed, many rely on prior knowledge of system parameters, offer limited damping performance, or involve complex models that lack physical interpretability, making them difficult to apply in practice. To address these challenges, this paper first introduces a physically intuitive RLC equivalent circuit model to explain the root causes of APOs in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes. By mapping inertia, damping, and feeder impedance to capacitive, resistive, and inductive elements, respectively, the model reveals how mismatches among converters lead to inter-unit oscillations characterized by LC resonance. Building on this insight, we propose two mode-specific mitigation strategies: in SA mode, a graph theory based impedance control ensures proportional reactive power sharing and effectively suppresses APOs; and in GC mode, adaptive inertia and damping control with feedforward filtering is designed to reshape transient power dynamics while preserving frequency stability. The proposed methods are validated through extensive simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness in suppressing oscillations and enhancing the robustness of multi-converter power systems.</p>

            <h2>NEO-Grid: A Neural Approximation Framework for Optimization and Control in Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Chehade, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>The rise of distributed energy resources (DERs) is reshaping modern distribution grids, introducing new challenges in attaining voltage stability under dynamic and decentralized operating conditions. This paper presents NEO-Grid, a unified learning-based framework for volt-var optimization (VVO) and volt-var control (VVC) that leverages neural network surrogates for power flow and deep equilibrium models (DEQs) for closed-loop control. Our method replaces traditional linear approximations with piecewise-linear ReLU networks trained to capture the nonlinear relationship between power injections and voltage magnitudes. For control, we model the recursive interaction between voltage and inverter response using DEQs, allowing direct fixed-point computation and efficient training via implicit differentiation. We evaluated NEO-Grid on the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating that it significantly improves voltage regulation performance compared to standard linear and heuristic baselines in both optimization and control settings. Our results establish NEO-Grid as a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution for learning-based voltage regulation in distribution grids.</p>

Each architecture includes typical elements such as synchronous generators, propulsion motors, energy storage system units, extra propulsive loads, and pulse power loads.

            <h2>Optimized Operation of Standalone Battery Energy Storage Systems in the Cross-Market Energy Arbitrage Business</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis van Sandbergen</p>
            <p>The provision of renewable electricity is the foundation for a sustainable future. To achieve the goal of sustainable renewable energy, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) could play a key role to counteract the intermittency of solar and wind generation power. In order to aid the system, the BESS can simply charge at low wholesale prices and discharge during high prices, which is also called energy arbitrage. However, the real-time execution of energy arbitrage is not straightforward for many companies due to the fundamentally different behavior of storages compared to conventional power plants. In this work, the optimized operation of standalone BESS in the cross-market energy arbitrage business is addressed by describing a generic framework for trading integrated BESS operation, the development of a suitable backtest engine and a specific optimization-based strategy formulation for cross-market optimized BESS operation. In addition, this strategy is tested in a case study with a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of forecast uncertainty. The results show that the proposed strategy allows an increment in revenues by taking advantage of the increasing market volatility. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of the proposed strategy, as only a moderate portion of revenues will be lost if real forecasts are adopted.</p>

            <h2>Linear Phase Balancing Scheme using Voltage Unbalance Sensitivities in Multi-phase Power Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians, modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milan Marocchi, Matthew Fynn, Kayapanda Mandana, Yue Rong</p>
            <p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of generative audio raises ethical and security concerns stemming from forged data, making deepfake sound detection an important safeguard against the malicious use of such technologies. Although prior studies have explored this task, existing methods largely focus on binary classification and fall short in explaining how manipulations occur, tracing where the sources originated, or generalizing to unseen sources-thereby limiting the explainability and reliability of detection. To address these limitations, we present FakeSound2, a benchmark designed to advance deepfake sound detection beyond binary accuracy. FakeSound2 evaluates models across three dimensions: localization, traceability, and generalization, covering 6 manipulation types and 12 diverse sources. Experimental results show that although current systems achieve high classification accuracy, they struggle to recognize forged pattern distributions and provide reliable explanations. By highlighting these gaps, FakeSound2 establishes a comprehensive benchmark that reveals key challenges and aims to foster robust, explainable, and generalizable approaches for trustworthy audio authentication.</p>

            <p>In this article, we investigate small-signal frequency and DC voltage stability of hybrid AC/DC power systems that combine AC and DC transmission, conventional machine- based generation, and converter-interfaced generation. The main contributions of this work are a compact frequency domain representation of hybrid AC/DC systems and associated stability conditions that can be divided into conditions on the individual bus dynamics and conditions on each DC network. The bus- level conditions apply to a wide range of technologies (e.g., synchronous generators, synchronous condensers, grid-forming renewables and energy storage). Moreover, the system-level conditions establish that hybrid AC/DC systems combining a wide range of devices are stable independently of the network topology provided that the frequency response of converters on each DC network is sufficiently coherent relative to the network coupling strength. Additionally, we develop and validate a novel reduced- order damper winding model for multi-machine systems.</p>

            <p>In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p>

            <p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems. However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions, and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Wireless Powered MEC Systems via Discrete Pinching Antennas: TDMA versus NOMA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Liu, Zesong Fei, Meng Hua, Guangji Chen, Xinyi Wang, Ruiqi Liu</p>
            <p>Pinching antennas (PAs), a new type of reconfigurable and flexible antenna structures, have recently attracted significant research interest due to their ability to create line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss. Owing to their potential benefits, integrating PAs into wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) systems is regarded as a viable solution to enhance both energy transfer and task offloading efficiency. Unlike prior studies that assume ideal continuous PA placement along waveguides, this paper investigates a practical discrete PA-assisted wireless powered MEC framework, where devices first harvest energy from PA-emitted radio-frequency signals and then adopt a partial offloading mode, allocating part of the harvested energy to local computing and the remainder to uplink offloading. The uplink phase considers both the time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), each examined under three levels of PA activation flexibility. For each configuration, we formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the total computational bits and conduct a theoretical performance comparison between the TDMA and NOMA schemes. To address the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear problems, we develop a two-layer algorithm that combines closed-form solutions based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a cross-entropy-based learning method. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed design in terms of the harvested energy and computation performance, revealing that TDMA and NOMA achieve comparable performance under coarser PA activation levels, whereas finer activation granularity enables TDMA to achieve superior computation performance over NOMA.</p>

            <h2>Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Assisted MU-MIMO Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Liao, Wei Guo, Hengtao He, Shenghui Song, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>The fluid antenna system (FAS) is a disruptive tech-nology for future wireless communication networks. This paper considers the joint optimization of beamforming matrices and antenna positions for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization in fluid antenna (FA)-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) networks, which presents significant chal-lenges due to the strong coupling between beamforming and FA positions, the non-concavity of the WSR objective function, and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based method that employs matrix fractional programming techniques to reformulate the original complex problem into a more tractable form. Then, we develop a parallel majorization maximization (MM) algorithm capable of optimizing all FA positions simul-taneously. To further reduce computational costs, we propose a decentralized implementation based on the decentralized base-band processing (DBP) architecture. Simulation results demon-strate that our proposed algorithm not only achieves significant WSR improvements over conventional MIMO networks but also outperforms the existing method. Moreover, the decentralized implementation substantially reduces computation time while maintaining similar performance compared with the centralized implementation.</p>

            <h2>Fluid Antenna Systems Meet Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenchao Liu, Xuhui Zhang, Chunjie Wang, Jinke Ren, Weijie Yuan, Changsheng You</p>
            <p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are widely regarded as a cornerstone of the emerging low-altitude economy, yet they face significant challenges, including rapidly varying channels, diverse functional requirements, and dynamic interference environments. Fluid antenna (FA) systems introduce spatial reconfigurability that complements and extends conventional beamforming, enabling flexible exploitation of spatial diversity and adaptive response to channel variations. This paper proposes a novel architecture for FA-empowered LAWNs and presents a case study demonstrating substantial improvements in communication, sensing, and control performance compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Key practical deployment considerations are examined, including mechanical design, position control, energy efficiency, and compliance with emerging industry standards. In addition, several future research directions are highlighted, including intelligent optimization, multi-function integration, and the exploration of novel low-altitude applications. By integrating theoretical analysis with practical deployment perspectives, this paper establishes FA systems as a key enabler for adaptive, efficient, and resilient network infrastructures in next-generation LAWNs.</p>

            <h2>A Federated Fine-Tuning Paradigm of Foundation Models in Heterogenous Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyi Wang, Zhongyuan Zhao, Qingtian Wang, Zexu Li, Yue Wang, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
            <p>Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising strategy to deliver low-latency and ubiquitous services for mobile devices. Recent advances in fine-tuning mechanisms of foundation models have enabled edge intelligence by integrating low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning. However, in wireless networks, the device heterogeneity and resource constraints on edge devices pose great threats to the performance of federated fine-tuning. To tackle these issues, we propose to optimize federated fine-tuning in heterogenous wireless networks via online learning. First, the framework of switching-based federated fine-tuning in wireless networks is provided. The edge devices switches to LoRA modules dynamically for federated fine-tuning with base station to jointly mitigate the impact of device heterogeneity and transmission unreliability. Second, a tractable upper bound on the inference risk gap is derived based on theoretical analysis. To improve the generalization capability, we formulate a non-convex mixed-integer programming problem with long-term constraints, and decouple it into model switching, transmit power control, and bandwidth allocation subproblems. An online optimization algorithm is developed to solve the problems with polynomial computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results on the SST-2 and QNLI data sets demonstrate the performance gains in test accuracy and energy efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Electric Vehicle Identification from Behind Smart Meter Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kamoona, Hui Song, Ali Moradi Amani, Mahdi Jalili, Xinghuo Yu, Peter McTaggart</p>
            <p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.</p>

            <h2>Short-Term Regional Electricity Demand Forecasting in Argentina Using LSTM Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar A. Oviedo</p>
            <p>This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly electricity demand in Córdoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of 0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii) an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Federated Aggregation of Demand Flexibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Dong, Ge Chen, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a federated framework for demand flexibility aggregation to support grid operations. Unlike existing geometric methods that rely on a static, pre-defined base set as the geometric template for aggregation, our framework establishes a true federated process by enabling the collaborative optimization of this base set without requiring the participants sharing sensitive data with the aggregator. Specifically, we first formulate the base set optimization problem as a bilevel program. Using optimal solution functions, we then reformulate the bilevel program into a single-level, unconstrained learning task. By exploiting the decomposable structure of the overall gradient, we further design a decentralized gradient-based algorithm to solve this learning task. The entire framework, encompassing base set optimization, aggregation, and disaggregation, operates by design without exchanging raw user data. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework unlocks substantially more flexibility than the approaches with static base sets, thus providing a promising framework for efficient and privacy-enhanced approaches to coordinate demand flexibility at scale.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a Separable Projective Approximation Routine-Optimal Power Flow (SPAR-OPF) framework for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems in power systems. The framework utilizes a separable piecewise linear approximation of the value function and learns the function based on sample sub-gradient information. We present two formulations to model the learned value function, and compare their effectiveness. Additionally, an efficient statistical method is introduced to assess the quality of the obtained solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using distributed generation siting and sizing problem in three-phase unbalanced power distribution systems as an example. Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%. The framework scales efficiently with system size, generating high-quality solutions in a short time when applied to a 9500-node distribution system with 1200 scenarios, while the extensive formulations and progressive hedging failed to solve the problem.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Economic Dispatch with Battery Energy Storage considering Wind and Load Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shishir Lamichhane, Anamika Dubey</p>
            <p>With the integration of renewable energy resources in power systems, managing operational flexibility and reliability while minimizing operational costs has become increasingly challenging. Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a promising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact of BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load uncertainties is captured, with scenarios generated using a method inspired by stratified and importance sampling. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system, where selected conventional generators are converted to wind power plants. Case studies show that strategic BESS deployment significantly improves system flexibility by reducing renewable curtailments and dispatch costs. Renewable energy curtailments decrease upon increasing BESS size and approach zero depending on wind penetration level. Higher wind penetrations result in greater curtailments without storage and yield larger cost savings when BESS is deployed, highlighting the growing need for flexibility as renewable energy penetrations increase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Nemati, Pedro Sánchez-Martín, Álvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Luis Rouco</p>
            <p>This paper proposes the integration of Concentrated Solar Power Plant (CSP) in the Renewable-only virtual power plant (RVPP) for bidding in the electricity day-ahead and secondary reserve markets, as well as trading thermal energy through a heat purchase agreement. A reformulated two-stage robust optimization approach is introduced to account for multiple uncertainties, including electricity prices, non-dispatchable renewable energy sources electrical production, CSP thermal production, and uncertainties in electrical and thermal demand consumption. The provision of energy and reserve by the thermal storage of CSP is modeled using an adjustable approach, which allocates a share of energy for up and down reserves based on the profitability of the RVPP. Simulations are conducted for several case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach under different RVPP operator decisions against uncertain parameters and various trading strategies for electricity and thermal energy. The simulation results show that integrating CSP into RVPP enhances RVPP flexibility for both electrical and thermal trading. Furthermore, the results indicate that the profitability of the RVPP increases when all trading options are considered, across different levels of conservatism adopted by the RVPP operator in response to uncertain parameters.</p>

            <h2>Frequency-Varying Optimization: A Control Framework for New Dynamic Frequency Response Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqiao Xu, Quan Wan, Alessandra Parisio</p>
            <p>To address the variability of renewable generation, initiatives have been launched globally to provide faster and more effective frequency responses. In the UK, the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has introduced a suite of three new dynamic services, where aggregation of assets is expected to play a key role. For an Aggregated Response Unit (ARU), the required level of frequency response varies with grid frequency, resulting in a frequency-varying equality constraint that assets should meet collectively. We show that the optimal coordination of an ARU constitutes a Frequency-Varying Optimization (FVO) problem, in which the optimal trajectory for each asset evolves dynamically. To facilitate online optimization, we reformulate the FVO problem into Tracking of the Optimal Trajectory (TOT) problems, with algorithms proposed for two scenarios: one where the asset dynamics are negligible, and another where they must be accounted for. Under reasonable conditions, the ARU converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time, and within the maximum delivery time requested by NESO. The proposed framework can be readily distributed to coordinate a large number of assets. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed control framework.</p>

We show that the optimal scheduling policy depends on the plant's internal renewable generation and follows a simple threshold structure. Under the optimal policy, thermal based water output decreases monotonically with renewable output, while membrane based water output increases monotonically. We characterize the structure and intuition behind the threshold policy and examine key special properties.</p>

            <p>Improving the fundamental performance trade-off in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems has been deemed as one of the most significant challenges. To address it, we propose in this letter a novel ISAC system that leverages an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and the UAV's maneuverability in six-dimensional (6D) space, i.e., three-dimensional (3D) location and 3D rotation, thus referred to as passive 6D movable antenna (6DMA). We aim to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing a single target while ensuring a minimum SNR at a communication user equipment (UE), by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the ISAC base station (BS), the 3D location and orientation as well as the reflection coefficients of the IRS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we aim to optimize the IRS's 3D location, 3D orientation, and reflection coefficients to enhance both the channel correlations and power gains for sensing and communication. Given their optimized parameters, the optimal transmit beamforming at the ISAC BS is derived in closed form. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed passive 6DMA-enabled ISAC system significantly improves the sensing and communication trade-off by simultaneously enhancing channel correlations and power gains, and outperforms other baseline schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun He, Andrew L. Liu, Yihsu Chen</p>
            <p>Designing socially optimal policies in multi-agent environments is a fundamental challenge in both economics and artificial intelligence. This paper studies a general framework for learning Stackelberg equilibria in dynamic and uncertain environments, where a single leader interacts with a population of adaptive followers. Motivated by pressing real-world challenges such as equitable electricity tariff design for consumers with distributed energy resources (such as rooftop solar and energy storage), we formalize a class of Stackelberg Markov games and establish the existence and uniqueness of stationary Stackelberg equilibria under mild continuity and monotonicity conditions. We then extend the framework to incorporate a continuum of agents via mean-field approximation, yielding a tractable Stackelberg-Mean Field Equilibrium (S-MFE) formulation. To address the computational intractability of exact best-response dynamics, we introduce a softmax-based approximation and rigorously bound its error relative to the true Stackelberg equilibrium. Our approach enables scalable and stable learning through policy iteration without requiring full knowledge of follower objectives. We validate the framework on an energy market simulation, where a public utility or a state utility commission sets time-varying rates for a heterogeneous population of prosumers. Our results demonstrate that learned policies can simultaneously achieve economic efficiency, equity across income groups, and stability in energy systems. This work demonstrates how game-theoretic learning frameworks can support data-driven policy design in large-scale strategic environments, with applications to real-world systems like energy markets.</p>

            <p>The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 has marked a significant paradigm shift in machine learning. Trained on massive corpora of data, these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities in language understanding, generation, summarization, and reasoning, transforming how intelligent systems process and interact with human language. Although LLMs may still seem like a recent breakthrough, the field is already witnessing the rise of a new and more general category: multi-modal, multi-task foundation models (M3T FMs). These models go beyond language and can process heterogeneous data types/modalities, such as time-series measurements, audio, imagery, tabular records, and unstructured logs, while supporting a broad range of downstream tasks spanning forecasting, classification, control, and retrieval. When combined with federated learning (FL), they give rise to M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs): a highly recent and largely unexplored class of models that enable scalable, privacy-preserving model training/fine-tuning across distributed data sources. In this paper, we take one of the first steps toward introducing these models to the power systems research community by offering a bidirectional perspective: (i) M3T FedFMs for smart grids and (ii) smart grids for FedFMs. In the former, we explore how M3T FedFMs can enhance key grid functions, such as load/demand forecasting and fault detection, by learning from distributed, heterogeneous data available at the grid edge in a privacy-preserving manner. In the latter, we investigate how the constraints and structure of smart grids, spanning energy, communication, and regulatory dimensions, shape the design, training, and deployment of M3T FedFMs.</p>

This study proposes a machine learning-based load shedding framework for the University of Lagos, designed to optimize distribution and reduce waste. The methodology followed three main stages. First, a dataset of 3,648 hourly records from 55 buildings was compiled to develop building-level consumption models. Second, Principal Component Analysis was applied for dimensionality reduction, and clustering validation techniques were used to determine the optimal number of demand groups. Mini-Batch K-Means was then employed to classify buildings into high-, medium-, and low-demand clusters. Finally, short-term load forecasting was performed at the cluster level using multiple statistical and deep learning models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and GRU. Results showed Prophet offered the most reliable forecasts, while Mini-Batch K-Means achieved stable clustering performance. By integrating clustering with forecasting, the framework enabled a fairer, data-driven load shedding strategy that reduces inefficiencies and supports climate change mitigation through sustainable energy management.</p>

            <p>The uptake of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) is increasing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. The rapid adoption of BEVs depends significantly on the coordinated charging/discharging infrastructure. Without it, uncontrolled and erratic charging patterns could lead to increased power losses and voltage fluctuations beyond acceptable thresholds. BEV charge scheduling presents a multi-objective optimization (MOO) challenge, demanding a balance between minimizing network impact and maximizing the benefits for electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) operators and BEV owners. In this paper, we develop an MOO framework incorporating a carbon emission program and a dynamic economic dispatch problem, allowing BEV users to respond by charging and discharging through grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies according to the optimal electricity price and compensation. Furthermore, we integrate dynamic economic dispatch with time-of-use tariffs to obtain optimal market electricity prices and reduce total costs over 24 hours. Our experimental results on a sample network show that the proposed scheduling increases participation in V2G services by over 10%, increases EVCS benefits by over 20%, and reduces network losses. Furthermore, increased rates of charging/discharging, coupled with more significant carbon revenue benefits for BEV users and EVCS, contribute to better offsetting battery degradation costs.</p>

            <p>HVDC-connected offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) are expected to provide inertial response and frequency containment reserve (FCR) to help address the frequency control challenges caused by the growing penetration of power electronics in power systems. Initially dominated by communication-based and grid-following (GFL) control, recent efforts have shifted towards incorporating communication-free and grid-forming (GFM) control into HVDC-OWPP systems to enhance their frequency response capability. This paper proposes a holistic GFM control based on dual-port GFM control to improve the coordination across the entire AC-DC-AC dynamics. A frequency response model of a typical HVDC-OWPP system is developed for GFM control design. Then, dual-port GFM control and virtual synchronous generator control are implemented respectively on the HVDC system and OWPP of the typical system, where the asynchronism of onshore and offshore frequencies is revealed. Next, holistic GFM control is proposed to improve the synchronization and DC voltage regulation. Finally, simulations on the delivery of FCR and inertial response are carried out to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control.</p>

            <p>The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested remedial actions.</p>

            <p>When detecting anomalous sounds in complex environments, one of the main difficulties is that trained models must be sensitive to subtle differences in monitored target signals, while many practical applications also require them to be insensitive to changes in acoustic domains. Examples of such domain shifts include changing the type of microphone or the location of acoustic sensors, which can have a much stronger impact on the acoustic signal than subtle anomalies themselves. Moreover, users typically aim to train a model only on source domain data, which they may have a relatively large collection of, and they hope that such a trained model will be able to generalize well to an unseen target domain by providing only a minimal number of samples to characterize the acoustic signals in that domain. In this work, we review and discuss recent publications focusing on this domain generalization problem for anomalous sound detection in the context of the DCASE challenges on acoustic machine condition monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Panoptic: True Joint mmWave Communication and Sensing with Compressive Sidelobe Forming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heyu Guo, Ruiyi Shen, Florian Kosterhon, Yasaman Ghasempour</p>
            <p>The integration of communication and sensing functions within mmWave systems has gained attention due to the potential for enhanced passive sensing and improved communication reliability. State-of-the-art techniques separate these two functions in frequency, use of hardware, or time, i.e., sending known preambles for channel sensing or unknown symbols for communications. In this paper, we introduce Panoptic, a novel system architecture for integrated communication and sensing sharing the same hardware, frequency, and time resources. Panoptic jointly detects unknown symbols and channel components from data-modulated signals. The core idea is a new beam manipulation technique, which we call compressive sidelobe forming, that maintains a directional mainlobe toward the intended communication nodes while acquiring unique spatial information through pseudorandom sidelobe perturbations. We implemented Panoptic on 60 GHz mmWave radios and conducted extensive over-the-air experiments. Our results show that Panoptic achieves reflector angular localization error of less than 2°while at the same time supporting mmWave data communication with a negligible BER penalty when compared with conventional communication-only mmWave systems.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Contraction Approach to Decentralized Adaptive Stabilization of Nonlinear Time-Delayed Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Kawano, Zhiyong Sun</p>
            <p>In this paper, we exploit a diagonally dominant structure for the decentralized stabilization of unknown nonlinear time-delayed networks. To this end, we first introduce a novel generalization of virtual contraction analysis to diagonally dominant time-delayed control systems. We then show that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized using diagonal high-gains, provided that the input matrices satisfy certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant conditions. To enable stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, guaranteeing that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin while the gains converge to finite values. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is illustrated through a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.</p>

            <h2>GNN Design for Learning HMIMO Beamforming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiyong Chen, Shengqian Han</p>
            <p>Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) has emerged as a potential technique for enhancing spectral efficiency (SE) while maintaining low hardware costs and power consumption. Conventional alternating optimization algorithms have been widely employed to design HMIMO beamforming, but their high computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a learning-based alternative with low inference time. However, in HMIMO systems, the fixed phase pattern, which captures the distribution of reference-wave phases across the holographic surface disrupts the permutation equivariance (PE) property, which is essential for GNN design. To address this issue, we reformulate the beamforming problem into a PE-compliant equivalent form and propose a novel network architecture consisting of a gradient-based GNN (GGNN) followed by two projection modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher SE with significantly reduced inference time than alternating optimization methods and exhibits superior generalizability compared to other learning-based baselines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nafize Ishtiaque Hossain, Kundan Saha, Atul Sharma, Sameer Sonkusale</p>
            <p>We report a scalable, self-powered in planta sensor platform for continuous monitoring of plant hydration and growth. The system integrates two components a leaf mounted tattoo sensor for estimating vapor pressure deficit and a kirigami inspired strain sensor for tracking radial stem growth. Uniquely, the tattoo sensor serves a dual function measuring temperature and humidity beneath the leaf surface while simultaneously harvesting power from ambient moisture via a vanadium pentoxide nanosheet membrane. This moist-electric generator configuration enables energy-autonomous operation, delivering a power density of 0.1114 miroW per square cm. The V2O5 based sensor exhibits high sensitivity to humidity and temperature, enabling accurate VPD estimation for over 10 days until leaf senescence. The eutectogel based kirigami strain sensor, wrapped around the stem, offers a gauge factor of 1.5 and immunity to unrelated mechanical disturbances, allowing continuous growth tracking for more than 20 days. Both sensors are fabricated via cleanroom-free, roll to roll compatible methods, underscoring their potential for large-scale agricultural deployment to monitor abiotic stress and improve crop management.</p>

            <h2>Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using Deep Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, Y. Thomas Hou</p>
            <p>Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available on GitHub [1].</p>

            <h2>Conditional Nearest Level Modulation for Improved Switching Dynamics in Asymmetric Multilevel Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinshui Zhang, Angel V Peterchev, Stefan M Goetz</p>
            <p>Modular multilevel converters have promising applications in clean energy, electric vehicles, and biomedical instrumentation, but need many modules to achieve fine output granularity, particularly of the voltage. Asymmetric multilevel circuits introduce differences in module voltages so that the quantity of output levels grows exponentially with the number of modules. Nearest-level modulation (NLM) is preferred over carrier-based methods in asymmetric circuits for its simplicity. However, the large number of output levels can overwhelm NLM and cause excessive transistor switching on some modules and output voltage spikes. We propose a conditional nearest-level modulation (cNLM) by incorporating mathematical penalty models to regulate switching dynamics. This approach improves output quality and reduces switching rates. Additionally, we present cNLM variations tailored for specific functions, such as enforcing a minimum switching interval. Experimental validation on an asymmetric multilevel prototype demonstrates that cNLM reduces the total output distortion from 66.3% to 15.1% while cutting the switching rate to just 8% of the original NLM.</p>

            <h2>Age of Information Aided Intelligent Grant-Free Massive Access for Heterogeneous mMTC Traffic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongwen Sun, Wei Chen, Yuxuan Sun, Bo Ai</p>
            <p>With the arrival of 6G, the Internet of Things (IoT) traffic is becoming more and more complex and diverse. To meet the diverse service requirements of IoT devices, massive machine-type communications (mMTC) becomes a typical scenario, and more recently, grant-free random access (GF-RA) presents a promising direction due to its low signaling overhead. However, existing GF-RA research primarily focuses on improving the accuracy of user detection and data recovery, without considering the heterogeneity of traffic. In this paper, we investigate a non-orthogonal GF-RA scenario where two distinct types of traffic coexist: event-triggered traffic with alarm devices (ADs), and status update traffic with monitor devices (MDs). The goal is to simultaneously achieve high detection success rates for ADs and high information timeliness for MDs. First, we analyze the age-based random access scheme and optimize the access parameters to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of MDs. Then, we design an age-based prior information aided autoencoder (A-PIAAE) to jointly detect active devices, together with learned pilots used in GF-RA to reduce interference between non-orthogonal pilots. In the decoder, an Age-based Learned Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (LISTA-AGE) utilizing the AoI of MDs as the prior information is proposed to enhance active user detection. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the proposed A-PIAAE has better convergence performance. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in reducing the average AoI of MDs and improving the successful detection rate of ADs.</p>

            <h2>Secure Short-Packet Communications for RIS-Assisted AAV Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huiling Liu, Junshan Luo, Shilian Wang, Fanggang Wang, Theodoros A. Tsiftsis, Symeon Chatzinotas</p>
            <p>Advancements toward 6G have intensified demands for ultra-reliable low-latency communication, positioning shortpacket communications as a critical technology for autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) networks. However, the open broadcast nature introduces significant security vulnerabilities. Although physical-layer security offers a low-complexity solution by exploiting wireless channel randomness, the AAV communication performance severely degrades in weak-coverage or non-line-of sight scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a short-packet communications framework for AAV networks that leverages reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with the aim of extending coverage and enhancing secrecy capabilities. Analytical frameworks are developed to evaluate the average secrecy throughput (AST) in finite blocklength constraints for both external and internal avesdropping scenarios, which incorporates non-orthogonal multiple access with imperfect successive interference cancellation. Asymptotic approximations of AST are derived as transmit power approaches infinity. Furthermore, we formulate a blocklength optimization problem to maximize the AST, effectively resolving the trade-offs among delay, reliability, and secrecy. Extensive simulations validate the analytical frameworks, which reveal that large-scale RIS deployment significantly boosts AST, and the power allocation coefficient exhibits dual effects in the internal eavesdropping scenario. These observations provide useful insights for designing reliable and secure lowlatency AAV communications systems.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion-Based Scenario Tree Generation for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Multistage Stochastic Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stelios Zarifis, Ioannis Kordonis, Petros Maragos</p>
            <p>Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain systems, such as energy markets and finance, where estimating the full distribution of future scenarios is essential. We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</p>

            <p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danish Rizvi, David Boyle</p>
            <p>This study departs from the prevailing assumption of independent Transmission and Reflection Coefficients (TRC) in Airborne Simultaneous Transmit and Reflect Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR-RIS) research. Instead, we explore a novel multi-user downlink communication system that leverages a UAV-mounted STAR-RIS (Aerial-STAR) incorporating a coupled TRC phase shift model. Our key contributions include the joint optimization of UAV trajectory, active beamforming vectors at the base station, and passive RIS TRCs to enhance communication efficiency, while considering UAV energy constraints. We design the TRC as a combination of discrete and continuous actions, and propose a novel Dual Actor Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-DDPG) algorithm. The algorithm relies on two separate actor networks for high-dimensional hybrid action space. We also propose a novel harmonic mean index (HFI)-based reward function to ensure communication fairness amongst users. For comprehensive analysis, we study the impact of RIS size on UAV aerodynamics showing that it increases drag and energy demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DA-DDPG algorithm outperforms conventional DDPG and DQN-based solutions by 24% and 97%, respectively, in accumulated reward. Three-dimensional UAV trajectory optimization achieves 28% higher communication efficiency compared to two-dimensional and altitude optimization. The HFI based reward function provides 41% lower QoS denial rates as compared to other benchmarks. The mobile Aerial-STAR system shows superior performance over fixed deployed counterparts, with the coupled phase STAR-RIS outperforming dual Transmit/Reflect RIS and conventional RIS setups. These findings highlight the potential of Aerial-STAR systems and the effectiveness of our proposed DA-DDPG approach in optimizing their performance.</p>

            <p>Automation now steers building HVAC, distribution grids, and traffic signals, yet residents rarely have authority to pause or redirect these systems when they harm inclusivity, safety, or accessibility. We formalize a Right-to-Override (R2O) - defining override authorities, evidentiary thresholds, and domain-validated safe fallback states - and introduce a Deliberative Audit Method (DAM) with playbooks for pre-deployment walkthroughs, shadow-mode trials, and post-incident review. We instantiate R2O/DAM in simulations of smart-grid load shedding, building HVAC under occupancy uncertainty, and multi-agent traffic signals. R2O reduces distributional harm with limited efficiency loss: load-shedding disparity in unserved energy drops from 5.61x to 0.69x with constant curtailment; an override eliminates two discomfort-hours for seniors at an energy cost of 77 kWh; and median pedestrian wait falls from 90.4 s to 55.9 s with a 6.0 s increase in mean vehicle delay. We also contribute a policy standard, audit worksheets, and a ModelOps integration pattern to make urban automation contestable and reviewable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuyuan Kang, Xiao Wang, Jingjing An, Da Yan</p>
            <p>Thermal energy storage (TES) is an effective method for load shifting and demand response in buildings. Optimal TES control and management are essential to improve the performance of the cooling system. Most existing TES systems operate on a fixed schedule, which cannot take full advantage of its load shifting capability, and requires extensive investigation and optimization. This study proposed a novel integrated load prediction and optimized control approach for ice-based TES in commercial buildings. A cooling load prediction model was developed and a mid-day modification mechanism was introduced into the prediction model to improve the accuracy. Based on the predictions, a rule-based control strategy was proposed according to the time-of-use tariff; the mid-day control adjustment mechanism was introduced in accordance with the mid-day prediction modifications. The proposed approach was applied in the ice-based TES system of a commercial complex in Beijing, and achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 389 kW and coefficient of variance of MAE of 12.5%. The integrated prediction-based control strategy achieved an energy cost saving rate of 9.9%. The proposed model was deployed in the realistic building automation system of the case building and significantly improved the efficiency and automation of the cooling system.</p>

            <p>Load redistribution (LR) attacks represent a practical and sophisticated form of false data injection (FDI) attacks, where the attacker manipulates grid data to influence economic operations of the grid through misleading security constrained economic dispatch (SCED) decisions.

However, the increasing integration of solar generation into power grids challenges this assumption, exposing new vulnerabilities. This paper proposes an enhanced load redistribution attack model, addressing new vulnerabilities introduced by the increasing integration of solar generation in power grids. The study demonstrates that manipulating solar generation data significantly disrupts grid economics, with peak impacts during periods of high solar generation.</p>

            <p>High costs of green hydrogen and of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) have hindered policy ambition and slowed real-world deployment, despite their importance for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, including cement and methanol. Given the economic challenges of adopting CCUS in cement and green hydrogen in methanol production separately, we propose a renewable-powered co-production system that couples electrolytic hydrogen and CCUS through molecule exchange. We optimize system configurations using an hourly-resolved, process-based model incorporating operational flexibility, and explore integrated strategies for plant-level deployment and CO2 source-sink matching across China. We find that co-production could reduce CO2 abatement costs to USD 41-53 per tonne by 2035, significantly lower than approximately USD 75 for standalone cement CCUS and over USD 120 for standalone renewable-based methanol. Co-production is preferentially deployed at cement plants in renewable-rich regions, potentially reshaping national CO2 infrastructure planning. This hydrogen-CCUS coupling paradigm could accelerate industrial decarbonization and scaling for other applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Bastianel, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun, Line Roald</p>
            <p>The increasing renewable penetration introduces significant uncertainty in power system operations. At the same time, the existing transmission grid is often already congested, and urgently needed reinforcements are frequently delayed due to several constraints. To address these challenges, adjusting the grid topology based on congestion patterns is considered a non-costly remedy to guarantee efficient power transmission. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a grid topology optimization model combining optimal transmission switching and busbar splitting for AC and hybrid AC/DC grids. The methodology incorporates RES forecast uncertainty through a scenario-based stochastic optimization approach, using real offshore wind data and K-means clustering to generate representative forecast error scenarios. The proposed model includes several formulations to be compared with a plain optimal power flow (OPF) model: hourly optimizing the topology, one topology for 24 hours, or a limited number of switching actions over a day. The grid topology optimization model is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Convex Problem, optimized based on the day-ahead (D-1) RES forecast and validated for AC-feasibility via an AC-OPF formulation. Based on the generation setpoints of the feasibility check, a redispatch simulation based on the measured (D) RES realization is then computed. The methodology is tested on an AC 30-bus test case and a hybrid AC/DC 50-bus test case, for a 24-hours (30-bus) and a 14-days (both test cases) time series. The results highlight the economic benefits brought by grid topology optimization for congested test cases with high penetration of RES. In addition, the results demonstrate that accounting for RES uncertainty with at least 6 to 8 scenarios leads to lower or comparable total costs to deterministic day-ahead forecasts, even when limiting the frequency of topological actions.</p>

Since both conditions take the form of linear matrix inequalities and are based on dissipativity theory, this yields a unified pipeline, resulting in a data-driven decentralized control algorithm. As a special case, we also consider stabilizing systems interconnected through diffusive coupling and propose a control algorithm. We validate the effectiveness and the scalability of the proposed control algorithms in numerical examples in the context of microgrids.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) panels are envisioned as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, providing a cost-effective means to enhance coverage and spectral efficiency. A critical challenge is the estimation of the cascaded base station (BS)-RIS-user channel, since the passive nature of RIS elements prevents direct channel acquisition, incurring prohibitive pilot overhead, computational complexity, and energy consumption. To address this, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation framework that reduces pilot overhead by grouping RIS elements and reconstructing the cascaded channel from partial pilot observations. Furthermore, conventional DL models trained under single-user settings suffer from poor generalization across new user locations and propagation scenarios. We develop a distributed machine learning (DML) strategy in which the BS and users collaboratively train a shared neural network using diverse channel datasets collected across the network, thereby achieving robust generalization. Building on this foundation, we design a hierarchical DML neural architecture that first classifies propagation conditions and then employs scenario-specific feature extraction to further improve estimation accuracy. Simulation results confirm that the proposed framework substantially reduces pilot overhead and complexity while outperforming conventional methods and single-user models in channel estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach for 6G RIS-assisted systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel three-stage framework for real-time foreign object intrusion (FOI) detection and tracking in power transmission systems. The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p>

            <p>Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantic-value/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Xiaolong Jin, Kai Hou, Zeyu Liu, Hongjie Jia, Wei Wei</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We develop a risk-averse storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming, explicitly accounting for uncertainty intervals in value function training. Real-time marginal value function bounds are derived using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge (SoC) and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. An adjusted storage dispatch algorithm is further designed using these bounds. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Because GPS signals are weak, electronic systems and components that are placed near GPS receivers can easily cause disruptive electromagnetic interference through their unintended radiated emissions. In this paper, EMC limit level guidelines are presented for electronics that are intended to be placed near to GPS receivers, as often happens in automotive and other applications. One of the challenges of defining limit-levels for systems intended to be integrated with GPS receivers is that the impact of noise at the input of the receiver may vary substantially depending on the form of the noise due to the correlator function implemented by GPS receiver. The quality of the correlated signal is typically represented using the carrier-to-noise ratio ($C / N_0$). A theoretical model predicting the degredation of the carrier-to-noise ratio with radio frequency interference is presented in this paper and is validated with realistic noise sources. The model is then used to develop guidelines to assess the impact of unintended emissions from electronic devices on nearby GPS receivers based on the frequency, bandwidth, and magnitude of the noise. These guidelines provide a more nuanced method of evaluating emissions than simple limit lines that are used by many emissions standards.</p>

            <h2>Jammer Mitigation in Absorptive RIS-Assisted Uplink NOMA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Azadeh Tabeshnezhad, Yuqing Zhu, Artem Vilenskiy, Van Ly Nguyen, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Tommy Svensson</p>
            <p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its enhanced spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider an uplink NOMA system operating together with a high-dimensional absorptive reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS). We aim to minimize the total power transmitted by the users in order to meet signal-to-interference-plus-noise constraints at the base station in the presence of a jammer. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using linear programming to find the transmit powers and a fractional programming algorithm based on the Dinkelbach algorithm with a sequential convex relaxation procedure to optimize the reflection coefficients. We show that our algorithm converges on large optimization problems, with a jammer comprising as many as $64$ antennas, and an A-RIS with $128$ elements. Our numerical results show that, compared with a standard RIS that reflects all impinging energy, the A-RIS can dramatically reduce the users' required transmit power and successfully mitigate interference from the jammer. The absorption capability of the A-RIS is in particular useful in cases when the number of jammer antennas is of the same order as the number of A-RIS elements.</p>

            <h2>Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Md Obaidur Rahman, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources. Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and critical data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous driving systems.

            <h2>A Cost-Optimization Model for EV Charging Stations Utilizing Solar Energy and Variable Pricing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> An Nguyen, Hung Pham, Cuong Do</p>
            <p>This paper presents a cost optimization framework for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations that leverages on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation and explicitly accounts for electricity price uncertainty through a Bertsimas--Sim robust formulation. The model is formulated as a linear program that satisfies vehicle energy demands, respects charging and grid capacity constraints, and minimizes procurement cost. Evaluations on real charging data from the Caltech ACN dataset show average savings of about 12\% compared to a first-come--first-served baseline, with peak monthly reductions up to 19.2\%. A lightweight sensitivity analysis indicates that a modest $\sim$5\% increase in nominal cost can reduce worst-case exposure by 14\%. Computational tests confirm real-time feasibility, with instances of up to 50 concurrent EVs solved in under 5 seconds on a standard laptop. The proposed method provides a practical, grid-friendly, and scalable solution for future EV charging operations.</p>

            <h2>Private Markovian Equilibrium in Stackelberg Markov Games for Smart Grid Demand Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siying Huang, Yifen Mu, Ge Chen</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy introduces a great challenge to the supply and demand balance of the power grid. To address this challenge, this paper formulates a Stackelberg Markov game (SMG) between an aggregator and multiple users, where the aggregator sets electricity prices and users make demand and storage decisions. Considering that users' storage levels are private information, we introduce private states and propose the new concepts of private Markovian strategies (PMS) and private Markovian equilibrium (PME). We establish the existence of a pure PME in the lower-level Markov game and prove that it can be computed in polynomial time. Notably, computing equilibrium in general Markov games is hard, and polynomial-time algorithms are rarely available. Based on these theoretical results, we develop a scalable solution framework combining centralized and decentralized algorithms for the lower-level PME computation with upper-level pricing optimization. Numerical simulations with up to 50 users based on real data validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods, whereas prior studies typically consider no more than 5 users.</p>

            <h2>Meta-model Neural Process for Probabilistic Power Flow under Varying N-1 System Topologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sel Ly, Kapil Chauhan, Anshuman Singh, Hung Dinh Nguyen</p>
            <p>The probabilistic power flow (PPF) problem is essential to quantifying the distribution of the nodal voltages due to uncertain injections. The conventional PPF problem considers a fixed topology, and the solutions to such a PPF problem are associated with this topology. A change in the topology might alter the power flow patterns and thus require the PPF problem to be solved again. The previous PPF model and its solutions are no longer valid for the new topology. This practice incurs both inconvenience and computation burdens as more contingencies are foreseen due to high renewables and a large share of electric vehicles. This paper presents a novel topology-adaptive approach, based on the meta-model Neural Process (MMNP), for finding the solutions to PPF problems under varying N-1 topologies, particularly with one-line failures. By leveraging context set-based topology representation and conditional distribution over function learning techniques, the proposed MMNP enhances the robustness of PPF models to topology variations, mitigating the need for retraining PPF models on a new configuration. Simulations on an IEEE 9-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system validate the model's performance. The maximum %L1-relative error norm was observed as 1.11% and 0.77% in 9-bus and 118-bus, respectively. This adaptive approach fills a critical gap in PPF methodology in an era of increasing grid volatility.</p>

            <h2>A Deep Learning Approach to Renewable Capacity Installation under Jump Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nacira Agram, Fred Espen Benth, Giulia Pucci, Jan Rems</p>
            <p>We study a stochastic model for the installation of renewable energy capacity under demand uncertainty and jump driven dynamics. The system is governed by a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process driven by a subordinator, capturing abrupt variations in renewable generation and electricity load. Installation decisions are modeled through control actions that increase capacity in response to environmental and economic conditions. We consider two distinct solution approaches. First, we implement a structured threshold based control rule, where capacity is increased proportionally when the stochastic capacity factor falls below a fixed level. This formulation leads to a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation (PIDE), which we solve by reformulating it as a backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. We extend the DBDP solver in \cite{hure2020deep} to the pure jump setting, employing a dual neural network architecture to approximate both the value function and the jump sensitivity. Second, we propose a fully data driven deep control algorithm that directly learns the optimal feedback policy by minimizing the expected cost functional using neural networks. This approach avoids assumptions on the form of the control rule and enables adaptive interventions based on the evolving system state. Numerical experiments highlight the strengths of both methods. While the threshold based BSDE approach offers interpretability and tractability, the deep control strategy achieves improved performance through flexibility in capacity allocation. Together, these tools provide a robust framework for decision support in long term renewable energy expansion under uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Platoon-Centric Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory Using Safe Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruining Yang, Jingyuan Zhou, Qiqing Wang, Jinhao Liang, Kaidi Yang</p>
            <p>With recent advancements in Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) emerges as a promising eco-driving strategy to reduce the number of stops and idle time at intersections, thereby reducing energy consumption and emissions. Existing studies typically improve energy and travel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the entire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i) car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric, safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety and platoon energy consumption.</p>

            <h2>Grid-informed Sharing Coefficients in Renewable Energy Communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Shooshtari, Antonio Pepiciello, José Luis Domínguez-García</p>
            <p>The role of energy communities in grid operations is highly dependent on the spatial distribution of their participants. In particular, when local energy producers and consumers are concentrated in different feeders, economic incentives from energy communities have the potential to affect local grid congestion. To address this challenge, we propose a feeder-aware allocation strategy that reflects grid topology in energy sharing. This strategy prioritizes energy sharing within the same feeder, thus incentivizing local generation-demand balance and improving grid operation. Different sharing coefficients are tested, such as equal, proportional, and rank-based, in both static and dynamic formulations. The proposed strategy is tested on data from a real energy community, whose participants are assumed to be distributed across four feeders. The analysis is carried out from the perspectives of the community as a whole, individual feeders, and single participants. Simulation results show that the feeder-aware strategy, in addition to promoting local energy balance, leads to higher and more stable revenues for most participants.</p>

            <h2>Topology and Fragility of European High-Voltage Networks: A Cross-Country Comparative Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bálint Hartmann, Michelle T. Cirunay</p>
            <p>Reliable electricity supply depends on the seamless operation of high-voltage grid infrastructure spanning both transmission and sub-transmission levels. Beneath this apparent uniformity lies a striking structural diversity, which leaves a clear imprint on system vulnerability. In this paper, we present harmonized topological models of the high-voltage grids of 15 European countries, integrating all elements at voltage levels above 110 kV. Topological analysis of these networks reveals a simple yet robust pattern: node degree distributions consistently follow an exponential decay, but the rate of decay varies significantly across countries. Through a detailed and systematic evaluation of network tolerance to node and edge removals, we show that the decay rate delineates the boundary between systems that are more resilient to failures and those that are prone to large-scale disruptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this numerical boundary is highly sensitive to which layers of the infrastructure are included in the models. To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative cross-country comparison of 15 European high-voltage networks, linking topological properties with vulnerability characteristics.</p>

            <h2>PowerGrow: Feasible Co-Growth of Structures and Dynamics for Power Grid Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu He, Chenhan Xiao, Haoran Li, Ruizhong Qiu, Zhe Xu, Yang Weng, Jingrui He, Hanghang Tong</p>
            <p>Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability, electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes, leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and realistic power grid scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Defense Against Coordinated Cyber-Physical Attacks: A Robust Constrained Reinforcement Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saman Mazaheri Khamaneh, Tong Wu, Wei Sun, Cong Chen</p>
            <p>Modern power systems face increasing vulnerability to sophisticated cyber-physical attacks beyond traditional N-1 contingency frameworks. Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</p>

            <p>The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of multi-robot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation.</p>

            <h2>Multi-sectoral Impacts of H2 and Synthetic Fuels Adoption for Heavy-duty Transportation Decarbonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youssef Shaker, Jun Wen Law, Audun Botterud, Dharik Mallapragada</p>
            <p>Policies focused on deep decarbonization of regional economies emphasize electricity sector decarbonization alongside electrification of end-uses. There is growing interest in utilizing hydrogen (H2) produced via electricity to displace fossil fuels in difficult-to-electrify sectors. One such case is heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), which represent a substantial and growing share of transport emissions as light-duty vehicles electrify. Here, we assess the bulk energy system impact of decarbonizing the HDV segment via either H2, or drop-in synthetic liquid fuels produced from H2 and CO2. Our analysis soft-links two modeling approaches: (a) a bottom-up transport demand model producing a variety of final energy demand scenarios for the same service demand and (b) a multi-sectoral capacity expansion model that co-optimizes power, H2 and CO2 supply chains under technological and policy constraints to meet exogenous final energy demands. Through a case study of Western Europe in 2040 under deep decarbonization constraints, we quantify the energy system implications of different levels of H2 and synthetic fuels adoption in the HDV sector under scenarios with and without CO2 sequestration. In the absence of CO2 storage, substitution of liquid fossil fuels in HDVs is essential to meet the deep decarbonization constraint across the modeled power, H2 and transport sectors. Additionally, utilizing H2 HDVs reduces decarbonization costs and fossil liquids demand, but could increase natural gas consumption. While H2 HDV adoption reduces the need for direct air capture (DAC), synthetic fuel adoption increases DAC investments and total system costs. The study highlights the trade-offs across transport decarbonization pathways, and underscores the importance of multi-sectoral consideration in decarbonization studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davood Keshavarzi, Alexander Koehler, Stefan M. Goetz</p>
            <p>An increasing integration of photovoltaic units, electric vehicle chargers, heat pumps, and energy storage systems challenges low-voltage power grids and can cause voltage range violation, loss of stability, (local) overload of lines, and power management problems. Research suggested universal power-flow control (UPFC) to solve power management problems. In contrast to bulky, slow, and costly conventional UPFCs with their shunt and series transformers, this paper presents a highly compact and current-dense power-flow controller, which can serve between different feeders in the low-voltage power grids. The enabler is a systematic combination of silicon car-bide (SiC) with silicon (Si) transistors and a strict partial-power topology built around a multi-active bridge. The circuit links an active-front-end converter as a shunt stage through a multi-active-bridge converter bidirectionally with low-voltage series-injection modules floating with their respective phases. The topology can use small power to control high currents through the low-voltage series-injection modules. The multi-active bridge serves as a multi-input-output power router that exchanges energy between all elements. We assess the design as well as the implementation considerations of the proposed power-flow controller mathematically and verify its performance in simulation and real systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Xiaolong Jin, Kai Hou, Zeyu Liu, Hongjie Jia, Wei Wei</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel privacy-preserving uncertainty disclosure framework, enabling system operators to release marginal value function bounds to reduce the conservativeness of interval forecast and mitigate excessive withholding, thereby enhancing storage dispatch and social welfare. We propose a risk-averse analytical storage arbitrage model based on stochastic dynamic programming and explicitly account for uncertainty intervals in value function training. We derive real-time marginal value function bounds using a rolling-horizon chance-constrained economic dispatch formulation. We rigorously prove that the bounds reliably cap the true opportunity cost and dynamically converge to the hindsight value. We verify that both the marginal value function and its bounds monotonically decrease with the state of charge and increase with uncertainty, providing a theoretical basis for risk-averse strategic behaviors and SoC-dependent designs. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework via an agent-based simulation on the ISO-NE test system. Under 50% renewable capacity and 35% storage capacity, the proposed bounds enhance storage response by 38.91% and reduce the optimality gap to 3.91% through improved interval predictions. Additionally, by mitigating excessive withholding, the bounds yield an average system cost reduction of 0.23% and an average storage profit increase of 13.22%. These benefits further scale with higher prediction conservativeness, storage capacity, and system uncertainty.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the transient and dynamical behavior of hybrid AC/DC systems using dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control. A generalized modeling framework for hybrid AC/DC networks is first introduced that accounts for converter, control, and network circuit dynamics and arbitrary network topologies. This modeling framework is applied to low-voltage networks to analyze the performance of dual-port grid-forming (GFM) control. The results demonstrate that active damping by dual-port GFM control is effective at improving the transient response and mitigating oscillations. In contrast, the steady-state response characteristics can be adjusted independently with minimal impact on damping characteristics. The dynamic model and results are validated through hardware experiments for three prototypical system architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-voltage DC distribution interfaced by AC/DC converters using dual-port GFM control, can serve both as the sole interconnection between AC distribution systems and in parallel to an AC connection, thereby enhancing the operational flexibility of low- and medium-voltage distribution networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quan Nguyen, Christine Holland, Siddharth Sridhar</p>
            <p>The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.</p>

By incorporating a voltage multiplier cell into the QBC, the converter significantly improves voltage boosting capability while mitigating stress on switching devices. In this configuration, the output voltage is obtained by combining the voltages across multiple output capacitors, thereby enhancing the overall voltage level. A detailed comparative study with recently reported converter topologies demonstrates the superior gain and reduced device stress offered by the HGVM-QBC. The design is validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, which confirm improved performance in terms of gain and voltage stress. Furthermore, an experimental prototype achieves an output of 151 Vdc from a 12 Vdc input at a 55% duty cycle, corresponding to a gain of 12.59. These results establish the HGVM-QBC as an efficient and reliable solution for PV applications that demand high voltage output from low input sources.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging Predictions in Power System Voltage Control: An Adaptive Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqi Cui, Yiheng Xie, Steven Low, Adam Wierman, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>High variability of solar PV and sudden changes in load (e.g., electric vehicles and storage) can lead to large voltage fluctuations in the distribution system. In recent years, a number of controllers have been designed to optimize voltage control. These controllers, however, almost always assume that the net load in the system remains constant over a sufficiently long time, such that the control actions converge before the load changes again. Given the intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable resources, it is becoming important to explicitly consider net load that is time-varying. This paper proposes an adaptive approach to voltage control in power systems with significant time-varying net load. We leverage advances in short-term load forecasting, where the net load in the system can be partially predicted using local measurements. We integrate these predictions into the design of adaptive controllers, and prove that the overall control architecture achieves input-to-state stability in a decentralized manner. We optimize the control policy through reinforcement learning. Case studies are conducted using time-varying load data from a real-world distribution system.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Geometry of Faulted Power Systems under High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources via Ellipse Fitting and Geometric Algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Ventura, Jaroslav Hrdina, Aleš Návrat, Marek Stodola, Ahmad Eid, Santiago Sanchez-Acevedo, Francisco G. Montoya</p>
            <p>Power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) present significant challenges for conventional protection schemes, with traditional distance protection methods failing to detect line-to-line faults during asymmetric conditions. This paper presents a methodology for electrical fault detection and classification using ellipse fitting and geometric algebra applied to voltage and current space curves. The approach characterizes electrical faults by fitting ellipses to voltage vector data, enabling fault detection with only a quarter-cycle. The method employs bivector components for line-to-ground fault classification, while ellipse parameters identify line-to-line and three-phase faults. The geometric representation preserves voltage or current curve shapes in three-dimensional space, overcoming Clarke transform limitations when zero-sequence components are present. Validation using simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates accurate fault identification and magnitude estimation, providing enhanced power system protection capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Learning Constraint Surrogate Model for Two-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Bahador Javadi, Amin Kargarian, Mort Naraghi-Pour</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant uncertainty in power system operations, making traditional deterministic unit commitment approaches computationally expensive. This paper presents a machine learning surrogate modeling approach designed to reformulate the feasible design space of the two-stage stochastic unit commitment (TSUC) problem, reducing its computational complexity. The proposed method uses a support vector machine (SVM) to construct a surrogate model based on the governing equations of the learner. This model replaces the original 2|L| * |S| transmission line flow constraints, where |S| is the number of uncertainty scenarios and |L| is the number of transmission lines with |S| much less than |L|, with a significantly reduced set of 1 * |S| linear inequality constraints. The approach is theoretically grounded in the polyhedral structure of the feasible region under the DC power flow approximation, enabling the transformation of 2|L| line flow limit constraints into a single linear constraint. The surrogate model is trained using data generated from computationally efficient DC optimal power flow simulations. Simulation results on the IEEE 57-bus and 118-bus systems demonstrate SVM halfspace constraint accuracy of 99.72% and 99.88%, respectively, with TSUC computational time reductions of 46% and 31% and negligible generation cost increases (0.63% and 0.88% on average for IEEE 57- and 118-bus systems, respectively). This shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach for practical power system operations under renewable energy uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Low-Complexity Null-Space-Based Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Luo, Jie Hu, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Zhiqin Wang</p>
            <p>Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has attracted sustained interest. We propose a null-space-based transmission scheme for multiuser SWIPT serving both energy users (EUs) and information users (IUs). Under a practical nonlinear energy-harvesting (EH) model and multiple waveform options, we revisit the role of dedicated energy beams (EBs). We show that, in general, dedicated EBs are unnecessary because information beams (IBs) with Gaussian signaling can simultaneously support wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT), unless special energy-centric waveforms (e.g., deterministic sinusoidal waveforms) are employed and provide sufficient gains. Guided by these insights, we formulate an optimization problem for EB design to enable dedicated waveform transmission for WET, and we develop a low-complexity algorithm that reduces computation by ignoring the WET contribution of IBs during optimization. Numerical results corroborate that deterministic sinusoidal waveforms outperform Gaussian signaling when the received RF power lies in the EH high-efficiency region, making dedicated EBs beneficial. The proposed scheme achieves computational complexity reductions of 91.43\% and 98.54\% for the cases $M=8,,K^I=K^E=2$ and $M=16,,K^I=K^E=4$, respectively, with negligible performance loss, thereby validating the efficiency of the low-complexity algorithm.</p>

            <p>The growing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications in 5G and beyond networks has significantly driven up power consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This surge in energy demand poses critical operational and sustainability challenges for mobile network operators, necessitating innovative solutions that enhance energy efficiency without compromising Quality of Service (QoS). Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, offers disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, promoting flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this disaggregated approach adds complexity, particularly in managing power consumption across diverse network components such as Open Radio Units (RUs). In this paper, we propose a hybrid xApp leveraging heuristic methods and unsupervised machine learning, integrated with digital twin technology through the TeraVM AI RAN Scenario Generator (AI-RSG). This approach dynamically manages RU sleep modes to effectively reduce energy consumption. Our experimental evaluation in a realistic, large-scale emulated Open RAN scenario demonstrates that the hybrid xApp achieves approximately 13% energy savings, highlighting its practicality and significant potential for real-world deployments without compromising user QoS.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco G. Montoya, Santiago Sánchez Acevedo</p>
            <p>Coordinate transformations provide dimensional reduction benefits across power system analysis, electric machine modeling, and power electronic converter control. This paper introduces a novel transformation based on Geometric Algebra that directly identifies the plane containing unbalanced quantity loci through bivector analysis. The method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems, requiring only two voltage or current measurements at different time instants. Through pure geometric reasoning, we demonstrate that our approach generalizes existing techniques while extending naturally to multi-dimensional systems. Experimental validation using real-time digital simulation and physical laboratory testing confirms the method's effectiveness under realistic conditions. Power electronics converter control implementation demonstrates significant practical advantages, eliminating zero component oscillations present in Clarke transformation under unbalanced conditions and enabling more effective control architectures. The combination of computational efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability represents a significant advancement for power system control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijie Liu, Weidong Mei, He Sun, Dong Wang, Peilan Wang</p>
            <p>Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI. This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation, based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of training reflections is large.</p>

            <h2>Design of Reliable and Resilient Electric Power Systems for Wide-Body All-Electric Aircraft</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mona Ghassemi</p>
            <p>To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, all-electric transportation is a promising option. In the U.S., the transportation sector contributes the largest share (29 percent) of greenhouse gas emissions. While electric vehicles are approaching maturity, aviation is only beginning to develop electrified aircraft for commercial flights. More than 75 percent of aviation emissions come from large aircraft, and this impact will worsen with 4-5 percent annual air travel growth. Aircraft electrification has led to two types: more electric aircraft (MEA) and all-electric aircraft (AEA). A MEA replaces subsystems such as hydraulics with electric alternatives, whereas an AEA uses electrically driven subsystems and provides thrust fully from electrochemical energy units (EEUs). For wide-body AEA, thrust demand is about 25 MW plus 1 MW for non-thrust loads, creating major challenges for electric power system (EPS) design. Achieving maximum power density requires minimizing mass and volume. Increasing voltage into the kilovolt range using medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) is a feasible option to enhance power transfer. Consequently, designing an MVDC EPS for wide-body AEA is critical. Because EPS failures could jeopardize passenger safety, reliability and resilience are essential. This chapter presents a load-flow model for DC systems to determine power flows in both normal and single-contingency conditions, followed by analysis of optimal MVDC EPS architectures. A complete EPS for wide-body AEA is introduced, with EEUs and non-propulsion loads located, distances estimated, and flow studies performed. Multiple architectures are evaluated for reliability, power density, power loss, and cost to identify optimal solutions.</p>

            <p>Distribution networks face challenges from the increasing deployment of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the emergence of bidirectional power flows. We propose a decentralized Volt/VAr control method based on a saddle-point reformulation and consensus+innovation (C+I) updates. Each agent at a controllable bus computes and enforces its own set-points using only neighbor communication. Our method embeds passive buses directly, preserves network physics through a linearized Jacobian model, and avoids any supervisory nodes. Simulation results on a modified CIGRE low-voltage network show voltage stability improvement within operational limits, indicating the viability of a fully decentralized (edge-based) Volt/VAr control solution.</p>

            <p>The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii) evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii) identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly dynamic and decentralized power systems.</p>

            <h2>Joint Optimisation of Load Balancing and Energy Efficiency for O-RAN Deployments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Abdelaziz Salama, Maryam Hafeez, Syed A. R. Zaidi</p>
            <p>Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture provides an intrinsic capability to exploit key performance monitoring (KPM) within Radio Intelligence Controller (RIC) to derive network optimisation through xApps. These xApps can leverage KPM knowledge to dynamically switch on/off the associated RUs where such a function is supported over the E2 interface. Several existing studies employ artificial intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) based approaches to realise such dynamic sleeping for increased energy efficiency (EE). Nevertheless, most of these approaches rely upon offloading user equipment (UE) to carve out a sleeping opportunity. Such an approach inherently creates load imbalance across the network. Such load imbalance may impact the throughput performance of offloaded UEs as they might be allocated a lower number of physical resource blocks (PRBs). Maintaining the same PRB allocation while addressing the EE at the network level is a challenging task. To that end, in this article, we present a comprehensive ML-based framework for joint optimisation of load balancing and EE for ORAN deployments. We formulate the problem as a multi-class classification system that predictively evaluates potential RU configurations before optimising the EE, mapping network conditions to three load balance categories (Well Balanced, Moderately Balanced, Imbalanced). Our multi-threshold approach (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive) accommodates different operational priorities between energy savings and performance assurance. Experimental evaluation using 4.26 million real network measurements from simulations demonstrates that our Random Forest model achieves 98.3% F1-macro performance, representing 195% improvement over traditional baseline strategies.</p>

            <h2>Joint Optimization of Energy Consumption and Completion Time in Federated Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Zhou, Jun Zhao, Huimei Han, Claude Guet</p>
            <p>Federated Learning (FL) is an intriguing distributed machine learning approach due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. To balance the trade-off between energy and execution latency, and thus accommodate different demands and application scenarios, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of total energy consumption and completion time through two weight parameters. The optimization variables include bandwidth, transmission power and CPU frequency of each device in the FL system, where all devices are linked to a base station and train a global model collaboratively. Through decomposing the non-convex optimization problem into two subproblems, we devise a resource allocation algorithm to determine the bandwidth allocation, transmission power, and CPU frequency for each participating device. We further present the convergence analysis and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm not only has better performance at different weight parameters (i.e., different demands) but also outperforms the state of the art.</p>

            <p>In developing EnergyNet we have leveraged and are extending lessons from telecom's shift from a centralized, circuit-switched phone system to decentralized, packet-switched data networks. EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths. The contribution is a coherent, open, and testable blueprint for software-defined, decentralized energy distribution, aligning power-systems engineering with networking principles and offering a practical route from legacy, synchronous grids to resilient, digitally routed energy distribution systems.</p>

            <p>Regulators and utilities have been exploring hourly retail electricity pricing, with several existing programs providing day-ahead hourly pricing schedules. At the same time, customers are deploying distributed energy resources and smart energy management systems that have significant flexibility and can optimally follow price signals. In aggregate, these optimally controlled loads can create congestion management issues for distribution system operators (DSOs). In this paper, we describe a new linear pricing mechanism for day-ahead retail electricity pricing that provides a signal for customers to follow to mitigate over-consumption while still consuming energy at hours that are preferential for system performance. We show that by broadcasting a linear price designed for price-signal control of cost-optimizing loads, we can shape customer load profiles to provide congestion management without the need for bi-directional communication or customer bidding programs.</p>

            <p>The increasing reliance on cyber physical infrastructure in modern power systems has amplified the risk of targeted cyber attacks, necessitating robust and adaptive resilience strategies. This paper presents a mathematically rigorous game theoretic framework to evaluate and enhance microgrid resilience using a combination of quantitative resilience metrics Load Served Ratio LSR, Critical Load Resilience CLR, Topological Survivability Score TSS, and DER Resilience Score DRS. These are integrated into a unified payoff matrix using the Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP to assess attack defense interactions. The framework is formalized as a finite horizon Markov Decision Process MDP with formal convergence guarantees and computational complexity bounds. Three case studies are developed 1. static attacks analyzed via Nash equilibrium, 2. severe attacks incorporating high impact strategies, and 3. adaptive attacks using Stackelberg games, regret matching, softmax heuristics, and Multi Agent Q Learning. Rigorous theoretical analysis provides convergence proofs with explicit rates , PAC learning sample complexity bounds, and computational complexity analysis. The framework is tested on an enhanced IEEE 33bus distribution system with DERs and control switches, demonstrating the effectiveness of adaptive and strategic defenses in improving cyber physical resilience with statistically significant improvements of 18.7% 2.1% over static approaches.</p>

            <p>Achieving net-zero targets requires the phase-out of fossil-based heating. A major challenge is the seasonal mismatch between renewable heat supply and demand. District heating networks often dispose of excess heat in summer and rely on fossil backups in winter. Large-scale thermal energy storage offers a solution by storing surplus summer heat for use during winter, thus reducing the need for fossil fuels. This study investigates the feasibility of a large-scale thermal storage system at a power production site that supplies a large district heating network in the city of Bern, Switzerland. Specifically, the study examines the potential of a geothermal storage system to offset fossil fuel heat generation in winter by utilising heat stored during the summer months. Using a Python-based multi-energy system model, we simulate the optimal operation of the geothermal storage system with respect to cost and emissions, considering both supply and demand on an hourly basis over one year. Multi-objective optimisation is applied to generate a Pareto-optimal front. The results show that the geothermal storage system eliminates the requirement of 8 GWh of gas-powered heat supply and increases the waste heat utilisation by 20%, therefore lowering emissions. This effect is further increased when combined with an expansion of the district heating network, as individual, emission-heavy heaters are replaced by low-emission heat from the district heating network. The findings presented in this study can prove useful when evaluating similar systems across Switzerland.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahman Khorramfar, Dharik Mallapragada, Saurabh Amin</p>
            <p>Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Davoudi, Junjie Qin, Xiaojun Lin</p>
            <p>This study investigates market-driven long-term investment decisions in distributed solar panels by individual investors. We consider a setting where investment decisions are driven by expected revenue from participating in short-term electricity markets over the panel's lifespan. These revenues depend on short-term markets equilibria, i.e., prices and allocations, which are influenced by aggregate invested panel capacity participating in the markets. We model the interactions among investors by a non-atomic game and develop a framework that links short-term markets equilibria to the resulting long-term investment equilibrium. Then, within this framework, we analyze three market mechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a product-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and grid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that trades claims or rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante, rather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive expressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and analytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium aggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations under different conditions and theoretically establish that the product-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment, while the single-product market consistently results in under-investment. We also establish that the contract-based market leads to over-investment when the extra valuations of users for solar energy are small. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiemin Mo, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>High penetration of renewable energy sources intensifies frequency fluctuations in multi-area power systems, challenging both stability and operational safety. This paper proposes a novel distributed frequency control method that ensures transient frequency safety and enforces generation capacity constraints, while achieving steady-state frequency restoration and optimal economic operation. The method integrates a feedback optimization (FO)-based controller and a safety corrector. The FO-based controller generates reference setpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady state corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety corrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to maintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while respecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational burden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical applicability. Theoretical analysis establishes optimality, asymptotic stability, and transient frequency safety for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies show that, compared with conventional FO-based schemes, the method consistently enforces frequency safety and capacity limits, achieves smaller frequency deviations and faster recovery, thereby demonstrating its practical effectiveness and advantages.</p>

            <h2>Partitioning and Self-organization of Distributed Generation in Large Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Badr Al Faiya, Stephen McArthur, Ivana Kockar</p>
            <p>Distribution networks will experience more installations of distributed generation (DG) that is unpredictable and stochastic in nature. Greater distributed control and intelligence will allow challenges such as voltage control to be handled effectively. The partitioning of power networks into smaller clusters provides a method to split the control problem into manageable sub-problems. This paper presents a community detection-based partitioning technique for distribution networks considering local DGs, allowing them to be grouped and controlled in a distributed manner by using local signals and measurements. This method also allows each community to control the voltage using only neighboring DGs, and for each community to self-organize to reflect varying DG conditions and to maintain stable control. Simulations demonstrate that the partitioning of the large distribution network is effective, and each community is able to self-organize and to regulate the voltage independently using only its local DGs.</p>

            <h2>Grid impedance estimation based Kalman Filter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phuoc Sang Nguyen, Ghavameddin Nourbakhsh, Gerard Ledwich</p>
            <p>Modern power systems face new operational hurdles due to the increasing adoption of inverter-coupled distributed energy resources, which impact system stability and control. Central to these challenges is the dynamic nature of grid impedance. To address this, a novel real-time estimation algorithm based on the Discrete Fourier Transform is proposed. This algorithm is embedded within an Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter framework that employs a Linear Quadratic Regulator for current control (AAEKF-LQR). The impedance data directly informs and refines the controller's phase angle estimation. Simulation analyses demonstrate robust collaboration between the estimator and controller, sustaining system stability under weak grid conditions. The technique proves capable of delivering swift and accurate impedance updates during grid variations, which is crucial for maintaining stable inverter operation</p>

            <h2>PRIME: Fast Primal-Dual Feedback Optimization for Markets with Application to Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Julian Behr, Mattia Bianchi, Keith Moffat, Saverio Bolognani, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers iteratively drive a plant to an optimal operating point that satisfies input and output constraints, relying solely on the input-output sensitivity as model information. This paper introduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on proximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can handle non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and effectively reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been considered a key feature of next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the joint design of the radar receive filter and dual-functional transmit waveform for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system. While optimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the radar receive spatial response and maximizing the achievable rate at the communication receiver, besides the constraints of full-power radar receiving filter and unimodular transmit sequence, we control the maximum range sidelobe level, which is often overlooked in existing ISAC waveform design literature, for better radar imaging performance. To solve the formulated optimization problem with convex and nonconvex constraints, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm. For each subproblem in the proposed inexact ALM algorithm, we custom-design a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) scheme with closed-form solutions for all blocks of variable to enhance the computational efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to provide a stationary and feasible solution. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the impact of different system parameters on communication and radar imaging performance. Comparison with the existing works shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p>Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this never-before used spectrum for cellular by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity tradeoffs, while examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output technologies, challenges for commercial deployment, and potential solutions for FR3, including multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</p>

            <h2>Ultra-Wideband Communications: Interference Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brian Nelson, Hussein Moradi, Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny</p>
            <p>The idea of ultra-wideband (UWB) communications for short ranges (up to a few tens of meters) has been around for nearly three decades. However, despite significant efforts by the industry, UWB deployment has not yet reached its predicted potential. This article, thus, seeks to rectify this situation by providing a practical examination of UWB interference conditions. Through a spectrum survey of today's wireless environments, we explore the interference that UWB devices may face from a perspective of outage probability in both high- and low-rate configurations. We find that by suppressing interference, the outage probability can be reduced by one or more orders of magnitude. In the non-line-of sight channels, in particular, we find that both interference suppression and bandwidth expansion are required to support the minimum data rates suggested in the IEEE802.15.4 series of standards. We connect these findings to a recently proposed UWB signaling method based on filter banks and show this method fulfills the above requirements for implementing effective UWB systems.</p>

Quantum computing (QC) emerges as a promising technology for efficient large-scale optimization. We present our vision of leveraging QC to tackle key classes of problems in future mobile networks. By analyzing and identifying common features, particularly their graph-centric representation, we propose a unified strategy involving QC algorithms. Specifically, we outline a methodology for optimization using quantum annealing as well as quantum reinforcement learning. Additionally, we discuss the main challenges that QC algorithms and hardware must overcome to effectively optimize future networks.</p>

            <h2>Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Wolf-Monheim</p>
            <p>Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.</p>

            <p>This study presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based control framework aimed at enhancing the safety and robustness of the quadcopter, with a specific focus on resilience to in-flight one propeller failure. Addressing the critical need of a robust control strategy for maintaining a desired altitude for the quadcopter to safe the hardware and the payload in physical applications. The proposed framework investigates two RL methodologies Dynamic Programming (DP) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to overcome the challenges posed by the rotor failure mechanism of the quadcopter. DP, a model-based approach, is leveraged for its convergence guarantees, despite high computational demands, whereas DDPG, a model-free technique, facilitates rapid computation but with constraints on solution duration. The research challenge arises from training RL algorithms on large dimensions and action domains. With modifications to the existing DP and DDPG algorithms, the controllers were trained not only to cater for large continuous state and action domain and also achieve a desired state after an inflight propeller failure. To verify the robustness of the proposed control framework, extensive simulations were conducted in a MATLAB environment across various initial conditions and underscoring its viability for mission-critical quadcopter applications. A comparative analysis was performed between both RL algorithms and their potential for applications in faulty aerial systems.</p>

            <p>The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.</p>

            <h2>Neural Proxies for Sound Synthesizers: Learning Perceptually Informed Preset Representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Combes, Stefan Weinzierl, Klaus Obermayer</p>
            <p>Deep learning appears as an appealing solution for Automatic Synthesizer Programming (ASP), which aims to assist musicians and sound designers in programming sound synthesizers. However, integrating software synthesizers into training pipelines is challenging due to their potential non-differentiability. This work tackles this challenge by introducing a method to approximate arbitrary synthesizers. Specifically, we train a neural network to map synthesizer presets onto an audio embedding space derived from a pretrained model. This facilitates the definition of a neural proxy that produces compact yet effective representations, thereby enabling the integration of audio embedding loss into neural-based ASP systems for black-box synthesizers. We evaluate the representations derived by various pretrained audio models in the context of neural-based nASP and assess the effectiveness of several neural network architectures, including feedforward, recurrent, and transformer-based models, in defining neural proxies. We evaluate the proposed method using both synthetic and hand-crafted presets from three popular software synthesizers and assess its performance in a synthesizer sound matching downstream task. While the benefits of the learned representation are nuanced by resource requirements, encouraging results were obtained for all synthesizers, paving the way for future research into the application of synthesizer proxies for neural-based ASP systems.</p>

            <h2>Can SSD-Mamba2 Unlock Reinforcement Learning for End-to-End Motion Control?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gavin Tao, Yinuo Wang, Jinzhao Zhou</p>
            <p>End-to-end reinforcement learning for motion control promises unified perception-action policies that scale across embodiments and tasks, yet most deployed controllers are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context. We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations (e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion control.</p>

            <h2>Differential Dynamic Programming for the Optimal Control Problem with an Ellipsoidal Target Set and Its Statistical Inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sungjun Eom, Gyunghoon Park</p>
            <p>This work addresses an extended class of optimal control problems where a target for a system state has the form of an ellipsoid rather than a fixed, single point. As a computationally affordable method for resolving the extended problem, we present a revised version of the differential dynamic programming (DDP), termed the differential dynamic programming with ellipsoidal target set (ETS-DDP). To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is reformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator, yielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some points. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in the ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions to smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by utilizing the explicit form of the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a statistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal target set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert demonstrations. Via a simulation on autonomous parking of a vehicle, it is seen that the proposed ETS-DDP efficiently derives an admissible state trajectory while running much faster than the point-targeted DDP, at the expense of optimality.</p>

            <h2>Safe and Non-Conservative Contingency Planning for Autonomous Vehicles via Online Learning-Based Reachable Set Barriers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Yang, Lei Zheng, Shuzhi Sam Ge, Jun Ma</p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles must navigate dynamically uncertain environments while balancing the safety and driving efficiency. This challenge is exacerbated by the unpredictable nature of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HVs) and perception inaccuracies, which require planners to adapt to evolving uncertainties while maintaining safe trajectories. Overly conservative planners degrade driving efficiency, while deterministic approaches may encounter serious issues and risks of failure when faced with sudden and unexpected maneuvers. To address these issues, we propose a real-time contingency trajectory optimization framework in this paper. By employing event-triggered online learning of HV control-intent sets, our method dynamically quantifies multi-modal HV uncertainties and refines the forward reachable set (FRS) incrementally. Crucially, we enforce invariant safety through FRS-based barrier constraints that ensure safety without reliance on accurate trajectory prediction of HVs. These constraints are embedded in contingency trajectory optimization and solved efficiently through consensus alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The system continuously adapts to the uncertainties in HV behaviors, preserving feasibility and safety without resorting to excessive conservatism. High-fidelity simulations on highway and urban scenarios, as well as a series of real-world experiments demonstrate significant improvements in driving efficiency and passenger comfort while maintaining safety under uncertainty.

This strategy relies on accurate image reconstruction of both pre-therapy and post-therapy images for patient selection and monitoring treatment. However, traditional reconstruction methods are hindered by challenges such as crosstalk in multi-isotope imaging and extremely low-count measurements when imaging of alpha- ({\alpha}-) emitting therapies. Additionally, to fully realize the benefits of new imaging systems being developed for theranostic applications, advanced reconstruction techniques are needed. These needs, alongside the growing clinical adoption of theranostics, have spurred the development of novel PET and SPECT reconstruction algorithms.

            <p>Normative modelling is an increasingly common statistical technique in neuroimaging that estimates population-level benchmarks in brain structure. It enables the quantification of individual deviations from expected distributions whilst accounting for biological and technical covariates without requiring large, matched control groups. This makes it a powerful alternative to traditional case-control studies for identifying brain structural alterations associated with pathology. Despite the availability of numerous modelling approaches and several toolboxes with pretrained models, the distinct strengths and limitations of normative modelling make it difficult to determine how and when to implement them appropriately. This review offers practical guidance and outlines statistical considerations for clinical researchers using normative modelling in neuroimaging. We compare several open-source normative modelling tools through a worked example using clinical epilepsy data; outlining decision points, common pitfalls, and considerations for responsible implementation, to support broader and more rigorous adoption of normative modelling in neuroimaging research.</p>

            <p>Microvascular imaging has advanced significantly with ultrafast data acquisition and improved clutter filtering, enhancing the sensitivity of power Doppler imaging to small vessels. However, the image quality remains limited by spatial resolution and elevated background noise, both of which impede visualization and accurate quantification. To address these limitations, this study proposes a high-resolution cross-correlation Power Doppler (HR-XPD) method that integrates spatial radiality weighting with Doppler signal coherence analysis, thereby enhancing spatial resolution while suppressing artifacts and background noise. Quantitative evaluations in simulation and in vivo experiments on healthy human liver, transplanted human kidney, and pig kidney demonstrated that HR-XPD significantly improves microvascular resolvability and contrast compared to conventional PD. In vivo results showed up to a 2 to 3-fold enhancement in spatial resolution and an increase in contrast by up to 20 dB. High-resolution vascular details were clearly depicted within a short acquisition time of only 0.3 s-1.2 s without the use of contrast agents. These findings indicate that HR-XPD provides an effective, contrast-free, and high-resolution microvascular imaging approach with broad applicability in both preclinical and clinical research.</p>

            <p>Controllable Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive singing voices reflecting user intent. While recent SVS systems achieve high audio quality, most rely on probabilistic modeling, limiting precise control over attributes such as dynamics. We address this by focusing on dynamic control--temporal loudness variation essential for musical expressiveness--and explicitly condition the SVS model on energy sequences extracted from ground-truth spectrograms, reducing annotation costs and improving controllability. We also propose a phoneme-level energy sequence for user-friendly control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt enabling user-driven dynamics control in SVS. Experiments show our method achieves over 50% reduction in mean absolute error of energy sequences for phoneme-level inputs compared to baseline and energy-predictor models, without compromising synthesis quality.</p>

            <p>The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.</p>

            <h2>The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimmy Joseph</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs 0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation. Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI, CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041: cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias audits.</p>

            <h2>A Markov Decision Process Model for Intrusion Tolerance Problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Kreidl</p>
            <p>We formulate and analyze a simplest Markov decision process model for intrusion tolerance problems, assuming that (i) each attack proceeds through one or more steps before the system's security fails, (ii) defensive responses that target these intermediate steps may only sometimes thwart the attack and (iii) reset responses that are sensible upon discovering an attack's completion may not always recover from the security failure. The analysis shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect detectors, it can be sub-optimal in the long run to employ defensive responses while under attack; that is, depending on attack dynamics and response effectiveness, the total overhead of ongoing defensive countermeasures can exceed the total risk of intermittent security failures. The analysis similarly examines the availability loss versus the risk reduction of employing preemptive resets, isolating key factors that determine whether system recovery is best initiated reactively or proactively. We also discuss model extensions and related work looking towards intrusion tolerance applications with (i) imperfect or controllable detectors, (ii) multiple types of attacks, (iii) continuous-time dynamics or (iv) strategic attackers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashil Wankhede, Nirabhra Mandal, Sonia Martínez, Pavankumar Tallapragada</p>
            <p>We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</p>

            <h2>Feedback Linearization-based Guidance Law for Guaranteed Interception</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Dorsey, Ankit Goel</p>
            <p>This paper presents an input-output feedback linearization (IOL)-based guidance law to ensure interception in a pursuer-evader engagement scenario. A point-mass dynamic model for both the pursuer and the evader is considered. An IOL guidance law is derived using range and line-of-sight (LOS) rate measurements. It is found that the range-based IOL guidance law exhibits a singularity under certain conditions. To address this issue, a fuzzy logic system is employed to smoothly blend the IOL guidance with the classical proportional guidance law, thereby avoiding the singularity. In contrast, the LOS-based IOL guidance law is free of singularities but suffers from divergence issues due to angle-related complications. To resolve this, a simple correction function is introduced to ensure consistent interception behavior. Results from Monte Carlo simulations indicate that both modifications of the IOL guidance laws cause interception with control limits applied.</p>

            <h2>Sensor Management in Multi-Stage Stochastic Control Problems with Imperfect State Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Kreidl</p>
            <p>Technological advancements in miniaturization and wireless communications are yielding more affordable and versatile sensors and, in turn, more applications in which a network of sensors can be actively managed to best support overall decision-making objectives. We propose modeling the opportunity for sensor management within multi-stage stochastic control problems with imperfect state information. Such formulations inherently assume the state of the modeled environment cannot be accessed directly but instead the controller can observe only noisy measurements of the state and, therefore, at each decision stage some form of state estimation is required before a control is actuated. The notion of sensor management arises when the modeled controls not only affect the subsequent evolution of the state but can also affect the nature of future measurements and, hence, the quality of state estimates that drive future control decisions. In principle, the optimal strategy for any appropriately modeled multi-stage stochastic control problem with imperfect state information (with or without opportunity for sensor management) is the solution to a dynamic program; in practice, the computational requirements are typically prohibitive yet dynamic programming methods are still useful to guide the development of effective suboptimal strategies. In this spirit, we model the opportunity for sensor management within small-scale examples of two well-studied dynamic programming formulations, namely (1) the finite-state/finite-action Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (PO-MDP) and (2) the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian Regulator (LQGR). These examples admit solvable dynamic programs and confirm how the interplay between sensing and acting is a natural by-product of a dynamic programming solution.</p>

Building on recent advances in score-based models, we investigate a specific noise schedule design and sampling acceleration by step-skipping to reduce the number of denoising steps during inference. We additionally propose a single-step signal-to-noise ratio informed denoiser as an extreme case of the step-skipping approach. Our methods achieve significant latency reductions without performance degradation, as demonstrated on a synthetic channel dataset representing an urban macrocell MIMO communications scenario.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angel L. Cedeño, Rodrigo A. González, Boris I. Godoy, Juan C. Agüero</p>
            <p>This work addresses the problem of state estimation in multivariable dynamic systems with quantized outputs, a common scenario in applications involving low-resolution sensors or communication constraints. A novel method is proposed to explicitly construct the probability mass function associated with the quantized measurements by approximating the indicator function of each region defined by the quantizer using Gaussian mixture models. Unlike previous approaches, this technique generalizes to any number of quantized outputs without requiring case-specific numerical solutions, making it a scalable and efficient solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed filter achieves high accuracy in state estimation, both in terms of fidelity of the filtering distributions and mean squared error, while maintaining significantly reduced computational cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S M Asiful Islam Saky, Ugyen Tshering</p>
            <p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. Accurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical for clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and variable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability. This work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for automated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural innovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction from noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical cross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced retinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is integrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of model decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework achieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance across most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM visualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation with clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural improvements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers a high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing OCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in AI-driven ophthalmic tools.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes and experimentally evaluates a joint clock recovery (CR) and equalization architecture tailored for high-speed sub-terahertz (sub-THz) wireless communication links. Specifically, a Baud-spaced digital receiver architecture is investigated that combines a constant modulus algorithm (CMA) equalizer with a blind timing error detector (TED), enabling robust symbol timing synchronization without decision-directed (DD) feedback or pilot symbols. The proposed TED leverages the CMA filter coefficients to estimate timing errors, which are then used to drive a Farrow interpolator operating at twice the symbol rate. The system is validated experimentally using a 140~GHz wireless testbed with 16-QAM modulation over a 10~GHz bandwidth. Results show that the proposed TED schemes outperform conventional blind TEDs, such as Gardner and blind implementations of Mueller \& Müller, in terms of bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), and intersymbol interference (ISI) suppression. These capabilities are especially relevant to next-generation spaceborne communication systems, where wideband sub-THz links are expected to play a key role in enabling ultra-high-data-rate inter-satellite and deep-space communications under challenging synchronization constraints.</p>

A systematic performance evaluation in multi-target scenarios, including the effects of scattering, demonstrates that our proposed interference mitigation methods achieve performance comparable to sensing-optimal constant modulus signals while utilizing higher order constellations for more efficient communications.</p>

            <p>This paper considers the problem of optimizing a missile autopilot. In particular, the paper investigates the application of an online learning technique to learn and optimize the gains of a three-loop topology autopilot for a planar missile modeled with nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear aerodynamics forces and moments. The classical autopilot for a missile is based on a three-loop topology, where each loop consists of tunable proportional gains. An adaptive three-loop autopilot is constructed by augmenting the classical autopilot's fixed-gain controllers with a learning-based controller, which is recursively optimized using retrospective cost optimization. Numerical simulations show that online learning improves the tracking performance of the classical autopilot in both nominal and off-nominal interception scenarios.</p>

            <p>This article proposes a distributed control method for matrix-scaled multi-agent networks aimed at achieving convergence within a user-defined time frame. The control law of each individual agent relies only on information from neighboring agents and is updated at discrete intervals determined by state-dependent triggering functions, reducing the frequency of agent interactions. To this end, first, the controller is augmented with a time-varying gain. Then, the dynamics of the closed-loop system over the finite-time interval is transformed into an infinite-time frame using time scaling. Lyapunov-based analysis is employed to derive suitable triggering conditions that guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the time-transformed system, thereby ensuring the prescribed-time convergence of the original system.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a kernel-based framework for physics-informed nonlinear system identification. The key contribution is a structured methodology that extends kernel-based techniques to seamlessly integrate partially known physics-based models, improving parameter estimation and overall model accuracy. The proposed method enhances traditional modeling approaches by integrating a parametric model, which provides physical interpretability, with a kernel-based function, which accounts for unmodelled dynamics. The two model's components are identified from data simultaneously, minimizing a suitable cost that balances the relative importance of the physical and the black-box parts of the model. Additionally, nonlinear state smoothing is employed to address scenarios involving state-space models with not fully measurable states. Numerical simulations on an experimental benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with performance comparisons against state-of-the-art identification techniques.</p>

We then evaluate the performance of the optimized constellations under three different fluid antenna (FA) port selection strategies: (i) Best Port, (ii) Fixed Port, and (iii) Random Port. Our simulation results demonstrate significant performance gains of optimized constellations over conventional constellations in both information rate and energy harvesting.</p>

            <p>Advances in neural network design and the availability of large-scale labeled datasets have driven major improvements in piano transcription. Existing approaches target either offline applications, with no restrictions on computational demands, or online transcription, with delays of 128-320 ms. However, most real-time musical applications require latencies below 30 ms. In this work, we investigate whether and how the current state-of-the-art online transcription model can be adapted for real-time piano transcription. Specifically, we eliminate all non-causal processing, and reduce computational load through shared computations across core model components and variations in model size. Additionally, we explore different pre- and postprocessing strategies, and related label encoding schemes, and discuss their suitability for real-time transcription. Evaluating the adaptions on the MAESTRO dataset, we find a drop in transcription accuracy due to strictly causal processing as well as a tradeoff between the preprocessing latency and prediction accuracy. We release our system as a baseline to support researchers in designing models towards minimum latency real-time transcription.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinming Wang, Lipeng Zhu, Shuai Han, He Sun, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a new architecture for the low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite ground station aided by movable antenna (MA) array. Unlike conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the MA array can flexibly adjust antenna positions to reconfigure array geometry, for more effectively mitigating interference and improving communication performance in ultra-dense LEO satellite networks. To reduce movement overhead, we configure antenna positions at the antenna initialization stage, which remain unchanged during the whole communication period of the ground station. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average achievable rate of the ground station by jointly optimizing its antenna position vector (APV) and time-varying beamforming weights, i.e., antenna weight vectors (AWVs). To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we adopt the Lagrangian dual transformation and quadratic transformation to reformulate the objective function into a more tractable form. Then, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm that alternately optimizes the APV and AWVs until convergence is reached. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MA scheme significantly outperforms traditional FPA by increasing the achievable rate at ground stations under various system setups, thus providing an efficient solution for interference mitigation in future ultra-dense LEO satellite communication networks.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel framework for integrated communication and computing (ICC) transceiver design in time-varying millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. In particular, in order to cope with the dynamics of time-varying mmWave channels, the detection of communication symbols and the execution of an over-the-air computing (AirComp) operation are performed in parallel with channel tracking, as opposed to existing state-of-the-art (SotA) on ICC where perfect knowledge of the channel at all time instances is typically assumed. For clarity of exposition, we consider a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) uplink scenario where multiple single-antenna user equipment (UE) transmit to a base station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas, such that each UE, or edge device (ED), precodes its own transmit signal, while the BS, or access points (APs), also performs receive beamforming. The proposed transceiver framework then estimates channel state information (CSI) and data symbols in parallel, using a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (BiGaBP) algorithm for joint channel and data detection (JCDE), aided by a channel prediction (CP) algorithm executed before each estimation window at the BS. The AirComp operation is then executed by means of an optimal combination of the residual signal. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in performing ICC in challenging time-varying mmWave channels, with minimal degradation to both communication and computing performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashish Patwari, Andrés Alayón Glazunov</p>
            <p>As the field of sparse arrays progressed, numerous array designs have been introduced with a focus on larger apertures and higher degrees of freedom (DOFs), resulting in maximally economic sparse arrays (MESAs) that operate with the least number of sensors required to provide a given aperture while ensuring a hole-free difference coarray (DCA). Consequently, MESAs are least robust to sensor failures and cannot afford the failure of even a single sensor. Multifold redundant sparse arrays (MFRSAs) provide a practical solution to the problem of sensor failures in sparse arrays by making sure that the array contains enough sensor pairs necessary to produce each spatial lag multiple times. Owing to this property, a \b{eta}-fold redundant array can withstand simultaneous failure of at least \b{eta}-1 sensors without losing the hole-free DCA property. Nevertheless, MFRSAs are also prone to hidden dependencies that prevent them from being fully robust. In this work, we present a systematic framework to evaluate the robustness of triple redundant sparse linear arrays (TRSLAs) against all possible two-sensor failures. After detailing the proposed approach, we present the failure analysis of representative TRSLAs available in existing literature. It is found that existing TRSLAs have some hidden vulnerabilities against the failure of some peculiar sensor pairs. Corresponding MATLAB programs and numerical simulations are provided for evaluation and use by the array processing community. The proposed approach has a great archival value as it can evaluate the robustness of any present or future TRSLAs through objective means.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces SA-OOSC, a multimodal large language models (MLLM)-distilled semantic communication framework that achieves efficient semantic coding with scenario-aware importance allocations. This approach addresses a critical limitation of existing object-oriented semantic communication (OOSC) systems - assigning static importance values to specific classes of objects regardless of their contextual relevance. Our framework utilizes MLLMs to identify the scenario-augmented (SA) semantic importance for objects within the image. Through knowledge distillation with the MLLM-annotated data, our vectorization/de-vectorization networks and JSCC encoder/decoder learn to dynamically allocate coding resources based on contextual significance, i.e., distinguishing between high-importance objects and low-importance according to the SA scenario information of the task. The framework features three core innovations: a MLLM-guided knowledge distillation pipeline, an importance-weighted variable-length JSCC framework, and novel loss function designs that facilitate the knowledge distillation within the JSCC framework. Experimental validation demonstrates our framework's superior coding efficiency over conventional semantic communication systems, with open-sourced MLLM-annotated and human-verified datasets established as new benchmarks for future research in semantic communications.</p>

            <p>Preterm birth (PTB), defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and long term health complications. Early detection is essential for enabling timely medical interventions. Electrohysterography (EHG) and tocography (TOCO) are promising non invasive tools for PTB prediction, but prior studies often suffer from class imbalance, improper oversampling, and reliance on features with limited physiological relevance. This work presents a machine learning pipeline incorporating robust preprocessing, physiologically grounded feature extraction, and rigorous evaluation. Features were extracted from EHG (and TOCO) signals using Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, statistical descriptors of wavelet coefficients, and peaks of the normalized power spectrum. Signal quality was enhanced via Karhunen Loève Transform (KLT) denoising through eigenvalue based subspace decomposition. Multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptron, and CatBoost, were evaluated on the TPEHGT dataset. The CatBoost classifier with KLT denoising achieved the highest performance on fixed interval segments of the TPEHGT dataset, reaching 97.28% accuracy and an AUC of 0.9988. Ablation studies confirmed the critical role of both KLT denoising and physiologically informed features. Comparative analysis showed that including TOCO signals did not substantially improve prediction over EHG alone, highlighting the sufficiency of EHG for PTB detection. These results demonstrate that combining denoising with domain relevant features can yield highly accurate, robust, and clinically interpretable models, supporting the development of cost effective and accessible PTB prediction tools, particularly in low resource healthcare settings.</p>

However, with the new requirements of 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, the conventional channel modeling methods face many limitations. Fortunately, the multi-modal sensors equipped on the intelligent agents bring timely opportunities, i.e., the intelligent integration and mutually beneficial mechanism between communications and multi-modal sensing could be investigated based on the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In this case, the mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic channel could be explored via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). This article presents a novel multi-modal intelligent channel modeling (MMICM) framework for 6G-enabled networked intelligent systems, which establishes a nonlinear model between multi-modal sensing and channel characteristics, including large-scale and small-scale channel characteristics. The architecture and features of proposed intelligent modeling framework are expounded and the key technologies involved are also analyzed. Finally, the system-engaged applications and potential research directions of MMICM framework are outlined.</p>

            <h2>Eye Movement Feature-Guided Signal De-Drifting in Electrooculography Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lianming Hu, Xiaotong Zhang, Kamal Youcef-Toumi</p>
            <p>Electrooculography (EOG) is widely used for gaze tracking in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC). However, baseline drift caused by low-frequency noise significantly impacts the accuracy of EOG signals, creating challenges for further sensor fusion. This paper presents an Eye Movement Feature-Guided De-drift (FGD) method for mitigating drift artifacts in EOG signals. The proposed approach leverages active eye-movement feature recognition to reconstruct the feature-extracted EOG baseline and adaptively correct signal drift while preserving the morphological integrity of the EOG waveform. The FGD is evaluated using both simulation data and real-world data, achieving a significant reduction in mean error. The average error is reduced to 0.896° in simulation, representing a 36.29% decrease, and to 1.033° in real-world data, corresponding to a 26.53% reduction. Despite additional and unpredictable noise in real-world data, the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional de-drifting techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications such as enhancing human performance augmentation.</p>

            <p>The Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Station-based or Route-based Charging Options addresses fleet optimization incorporating both conventional charging stations and continuous wireless charging infrastructure. This paper extends Schneider et al.'s foundational EVRP-TW model with arc-based dynamic wireless charging representation, partial coverage modeling, and hierarchical multi-objective optimization prioritizing fleet minimization. Computational experiments on Schneider benchmark instances demonstrate substantial operational benefits, with distance and time improvements ranging from 0.7% to 35.9% in secondary objective components. Analysis reveals that 20% wireless coverage achieves immediate benefits, while 60% coverage delivers optimal performance across all test instances for infrastructure investment decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khue Nong Thuc, Khoa Tran Nguyen Anh, Tai Nguyen Huy, Du Nguyen Hao Hong, Khanh Dinh Ba</p>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role in enabling seamless connectivity and intelligent home automation, particularly in food management. By integrating IoT with computer vision, the smart fridge employs an ESP32-CAM to establish a monitoring subsystem that enhances food management efficiency through real-time food detection, inventory tracking, and temperature monitoring. This benefits waste reduction, grocery planning improvement, and household consumption optimization. In high-density inventory conditions, capturing partial or layered images complicates object detection, as overlapping items and occluded views hinder accurate identification and counting. Besides, varied angles and obscured details in multi-layered setups reduce algorithm reliability, often resulting in miscounts or misclassifications. Our proposed system is structured into three core modules: data pre-processing, object detection and management, and a web-based visualization. To address the challenge of poor model calibration caused by overconfident predictions, we implement a variant of focal loss that mitigates over-confidence and under-confidence in multi-category classification. This approach incorporates adaptive, class-wise error calibration via temperature scaling and evaluates the distribution of predicted probabilities across methods. Our results demonstrate that robust functional calibration significantly improves detection reliability under varying lighting conditions and scalability challenges. Further analysis demonstrates a practical, user-focused approach to modern food management, advancing sustainable living goals through reduced waste and more informed consumption.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Event-Triggered MPC for Linear Parameter-Varying Systems with State Delays, Actuator Saturation and Disturbances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiping Zhong, Wanlin Lu, Langwen Zhang, Ziyang Bao</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a unified adaptive event-triggered model predictive control (ETMPC) scheme for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems subject to state delays, actuator saturation, and external disturbances. In existing studies, only a limited number of ETMPC methods have attempted to address either state delays or actuator saturation, and even these few methods typically lack co-design optimization between adaptive event-triggering mechanisms and the control law. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a Lyapunov-Krasovskii-based adaptive ETMPC strategy that enables the co-design optimization of both the triggering mechanism and the controller. Specifically, the event-triggering parameter matrix is adaptively optimized by embedding an internal adaptive variable within the Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like function. Furthermore, the actuator saturation nonlinearity is transformed into a convex hull representation. The infinite-horizon robust optimization problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraints. Invariant set constraints are introduced to ensure recursive feasibility, and mean-square input-to-state stability (ISS) under multiple uncertainties is rigorously established. Simulations on an industrial electric heating system validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing communication load.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zuo, Shujie Wu, Yuzhe Qian</p>
            <p>To address non-linear disturbances and uncertainties in complex marine environments, this paper proposes a disturbance-resistant controller for deep-sea cranes. The controller integrates hierarchical sliding mode control, adaptive control, and neural network compensation techniques. By designing a global sliding mode surface, the dynamic coordination between the driving and non-driving subsystems is achieved, ensuring overall system stability. The subsystem surfaces reduce oscillations and enhance tracking accuracy. Adaptive control dynamically adjusts system parameters, enhancing robustness against external uncertainties, while the neural network compensates for time-varying disturbances through real-time learning. The stability of the control scheme is verified on the basis of Lyapunov theory. The simulation results demonstrate that, compared to traditional PID control, the proposed controller exhibits significant advantages in trajectory tracking accuracy, response speed, and disturbance rejection.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Frequency Control for Multi-Area Power Systems Considering Transient Frequency Safety</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiemin Mo, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>High penetration of renewable energy sources intensifies frequency fluctuations in multi-area power systems, challenging both stability and operational safety. This paper proposes a novel distributed frequency control method that ensures transient frequency safety and enforces generation capacity constraints, while achieving steady-state frequency restoration and optimal economic operation. The method integrates a feedback optimization (FO)-based controller and a safety corrector. The FO-based controller generates reference setpoints by solving an optimization problem, driving the system to the steady state corresponding to the optimal solution of this problem. The safety corrector then modifies these references using control barrier functions to maintain frequencies within prescribed safe bounds during transients while respecting capacity constraints. The proposed method combines low computational burden with improved regulation performance and enhanced practical applicability. Theoretical analysis establishes optimality, asymptotic stability, and transient frequency safety for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies show that, compared with conventional FO-based schemes, the method consistently enforces frequency safety and capacity limits, achieves smaller frequency deviations and faster recovery, thereby demonstrating its practical effectiveness and advantages.</p>

            <p>Hearing aids (HAs) are widely used to provide personalized speech enhancement (PSE) services, improving the quality of life for individuals with hearing loss. However, HA performance significantly declines in noisy environments as it treats noise reduction (NR) and hearing loss compensation (HLC) as separate tasks. This separation leads to a lack of systematic optimization, overlooking the interactions between these two critical tasks, and increases the system complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel audiogram fusion network, named AFN-HearNet, which simultaneously tackles the NR and HLC tasks by fusing cross-domain audiogram and spectrum features. We propose an audiogram-specific encoder that transforms the sparse audiogram profile into a deep representation, addressing the alignment problem of cross-domain features prior to fusion. To incorporate the interactions between NR and HLC tasks, we propose the affine modulation-based audiogram fusion frequency-temporal Conformer that adaptively fuses these two features into a unified deep representation for speech reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a voice activity detection auxiliary training task to embed speech and non-speech patterns into the unified deep representation implicitly. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets to validate the effectiveness of each proposed module. The results indicate that the AFN-HearNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in-context fusion joint models regarding key metrics such as HASQI and PESQ, achieving a considerable trade-off between performance and efficiency.

            <h2>Data-knowledge fusion driven frequency security assessment: A robust framework for renewable-dominated power grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yurun Zhang, Wei Yao, Yutian Lan, Hang Shuai, Shanyang Wei, Wei Gan, Chao Duan, Jinyu Wen, Shijie Cheng</p>
            <p>Frequency security is critical for power grids, as deviations can trigger widespread outages and result in substantial economic losses. However, modern renewable-dominated power grids face an increased risk of insecurity due to low inertia and nonlinear frequency responses. To mitigate these risks, robust pre-fault frequency security assessment (FSA) is critical, which enables grid operators to implement preventive control strategies. We propose a data-knowledge fusion framework to achieve intelligent FSA in actual power grids. First, we classify FSA domain knowledge into two distinct categories: (1) physics-guided knowledge directs the neural network pre-training process, ensuring that the fusion model's predictions consistent with frequency response mechanisms, and (2) physics-constrained knowledge establishes quantitative relationship on predictions, which forces them within theoretical ranges defined by domain knowledge. Furthermore, we develop a dual-channel neural network architecture to simultaneously capture both local and global characteristics of the power system. Finally, we introduce a data-knowledge fusion training algorithm that integrates guided learning with constrained network architecture to enhance model reliability and generalization. Case studies on China's Yunnan Provincial Power Grid validate the superior performance of our framework: it reduces average prediction error to 1.26% (a 49.2% reduction over data-driven methods), and maintains 97.60% accuracy in untrained scenarios (3.85% higher than data-driven methods), therefore satisfies the accuracy, reliability, and generalization requirements for actual power grids. The proposed methodology establishes a new paradigm for enhancing robustness of FSA in power grids, with potential application to cross-domain security assessment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armel Koulong, Ali Pakniyat</p>
            <p>A distributed adaptive control strategy is developed for heterogeneous multiagent systems in nonlinear Brunovsky form with \({\pd}\)-dimensional $n^{\text{th}}$-order dynamics, operating under time-triggered switching communication topologies. The approach uses repulsive potential functions to ensure agent-agent and obstacle safety, while neural network estimators compensate for system uncertainties and disturbances. A high-order control barrier function framework is then employed to certify the positive invariance of the safe sets and the boundedness of the proposed control inputs. The resulting distributed control and adaptive laws, together with dwell-time requirements for topology transitions, achieve leader-following consensus. This integrated design provides synchronized formation and robust disturbance rejection in evolving network configurations, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuezhu Xu, S. Sivaranjani, Vijay Gupta</p>
            <p>We address the problem of learning a neural Koopman operator model that provides dissipativity guarantees for an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. We propose a two-stage approach. First, we learn an unconstrained neural Koopman model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Then, we minimally perturb the parameters to enforce strict dissipativity. Crucially, we establish theoretical guarantees that extend the dissipativity properties of the learned model back to the original nonlinear system. We realize this by deriving an exact relationship between the dissipativity of the learned model and the true system through careful characterization of the identification errors from the noisy data, Koopman operator truncation, and generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate our approach through simulation on a Duffing oscillator model.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), an emerging technology proposed for inclusion in next generation wireless communication systems, are programmable surfaces that can adaptively reflect incident electromagnetic radiation in different desired directions. To reduce the complexity and physical profile of conventional RIS designs, a novel concept known as Wave-Controlled RIS has been proposed, in which standing waves along a transmission line are used to generate the required dc bias for reflective control. This paper shows the design of such a Wave-Controlled RIS and its biasing transmission line. The effectiveness of this approach in generating the correct dc bias from a single standing wave frequency is analyzed through both theoretical modeling and experimental validation, which uncovered a dependence on impedance matching not accounted for by the theory. Additionally, the potential for reflective control using only a single standing wave frequency on the biasing transmission line is explored, demonstrating the ability of single-beam steering toward angles near broadside.</p>

            <h2>Joint Spatial and Spectral Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navid Reyhanian, Reza Ghaderi Zefreh, Parisa Ramezani, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>The deployment of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems cannot rely solely on digital precoding due to hardware constraints. Instead, hybrid precoding, which combines digital and radio frequency (RF) techniques, has emerged as a potential alternative. This approach strikes a balance between performance and cost, addressing the limitations of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters in mmWave systems. mmWave systems are designed to function in wideband channels with frequency selectivity, necessitating the use of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate dispersive channels. However, OFDM faces several challenges. First, it suffers from a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) due to the linear combination of subcarriers. Second, it suffers from out-of-band (OOB) emissions due to the sharp spectral transitions of OFDM subcarriers and windowing-induced spectral leakage. Furthermore, phase shifter (PS) impairments at the RF transmitter precoder and the user combiner represent a limitation in practical mmWave systems, leading to phase errors. This work addresses these challenges. We study the problem of robust digital-RF precoding optimization for the downlink sum-rate maximization in hybrid multi-user (MU) MIMO-OFDM systems under maximum transmit power, PAPR, and OOB emission constraints. The formulated maximization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. We propose a weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate descent (BCD) method to iteratively optimize digital-RF precoders at the transmitter and digital-RF combiners at the users. Low-cost and scalable optimization approaches are proposed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems. Extensive simulation results are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches and exhibit their superiority relative to well-known benchmarks.</p>

            <h2>Extended Version: Market-Driven Equilibria for Distributed Solar Panel Investment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Davoudi, Junjie Qin, Xiaojun Lin</p>
            <p>This study investigates market-driven long-term investment decisions in distributed solar panels by individual investors. We consider a setting where investment decisions are driven by expected revenue from participating in short-term electricity markets over the panel's lifespan. These revenues depend on short-term markets equilibria, i.e., prices and allocations, which are influenced by aggregate invested panel capacity participating in the markets. We model the interactions among investors by a non-atomic game and develop a framework that links short-term markets equilibria to the resulting long-term investment equilibrium. Then, within this framework, we analyze three market mechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a product-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and grid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that trades claims or rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante, rather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive expressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and analytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium aggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations under different conditions and theoretically establish that the product-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment, while the single-product market consistently results in under-investment. We also establish that the contract-based market leads to over-investment when the extra valuations of users for solar energy are small. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Everett Adams, James Richard Forbes</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a linear input-output observer design methodology for a population of systems in which each observer uses knowledge of the linear time-invariant dynamics of the particular device. Observers are typically composed of a known model of the system and a correction mechanism to produce an estimate of the state. The proposed design procedure characterizes the variation within the population in the frequency domain and synthesizes a single robust correction filter. The correction filter is compatible with all system models that satisfy the variation characterization such that a given level of estimation performance is guaranteed. This is accomplished by posing a robust performance problem using the observer error dynamics and solving it using $DK$-iteration. The design procedure is experimentally demonstrated on a flexible joint robotic manipulator with varied joint stiffnesses. It is shown that the proposed method that uses a single correction filter achieves comparable estimation performance to a method that uses a correction gain tailored toward each joint stiffness configuration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyue Huo, Yuheng Zhang, Yan Tang</p>
            <p>Modern end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper not only suffer from reduced recognition accuracy in noise, but also exhibit overconfidence - assigning high confidence to wrong predictions. We conduct a systematic analysis of Whisper's behavior in additive noise conditions and find that overconfident errors increase dramatically at low signal-to-noise ratios, with 10-20% of tokens incorrectly predicted with confidence above 0.7. To mitigate this, we propose a lightweight, post-hoc calibration framework that detects potential overconfidence and applies temperature scaling selectively to those tokens, without altering the underlying ASR model. Evaluations on the R-SPIN dataset demonstrate that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio range (-18 to -5 dB), our method reduces the expected calibration error (ECE) by 58% and triples the normalized cross entropy (NCE), yielding more reliable confidence estimates under severe noise conditions.</p>

            <p>This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans accelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data. The study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January 2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse pathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were reconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care (SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists independently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets using a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for 408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity Index (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally acceptable), and 95% scored $\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases >0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to moderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These findings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain MRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image quality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses three critical limitations in previous analyses of RIS-aided wireless systems: propagation environments with fixed diversity gain, restricted spatial correlation profiles, and approximation methods that fail to capture the system behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. To overcome these challenges, we conduct an exact asymptotic analysis focused on the left tail of the SNR distribution, which plays a critical role in high-SNR system performance. Additionally, to account for general correlation profiles and fading environments with variable diversity and coding gains, we consider arbitrarily correlated Nakagami-m fading channels. The analytical results show that fading correlation induces a horizontal shift in the asymptotic behavior -- represented as a straight line in the log-dB scale -- of the PDF and CDF, displacing these curves to the left. The asymptotic linear coefficient quantifies this shift, while the angular coefficient remains unaffected. Moreover, the results reveal that the high sensitivity of the linear coefficient to correlation arises from the aggregated contribution of all marginal asymptotic terms, effectively capturing each channel's correlation characteristics.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the RF-based Doppler shift distribution characterization of the Lunar South Pole (LSP) based inter-satellite link (ISL) in varying inclination. Doppler shift in parts per million (ppm) is determined and analyzed, as it provides an independence from the carrier frequency.

Goodness-of-fit is investigated and quantified with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and weighted mean relative difference (WMRD) error metrics. Simulation results show that ISL Doppler shifts reach up to $\pm1.89$ ppm as the inclination of the other orbit deviates higher from the reference orbit, inclining $80^\circ$. Regarding the error measurements of GMM fitting, the WMRD and KL divergence metrics for ISL take values up to 0.6575 and 2.2963, respectively.</p>

            <p>Preterm birth is a major cause of mortality and lifelong morbidity in childhood. Its complex and multifactorial origins limit the effectiveness of current clinical predictors and impede optimal care. In this study, a dual-branch deep learning architecture (PUUMA) was developed to predict gestational age (GA) at birth using T2* fetal MRI data from 295 pregnancies, encompassing a heterogeneous and imbalanced population. The model integrates both global whole-uterus and local placental features. Its performance was benchmarked against linear regression using cervical length measurements obtained by experienced clinicians from anatomical MRI and other Deep Learning architectures. The GA at birth predictions were assessed using mean absolute error. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess preterm classification. Both the fully automated MRI-based pipeline and the cervical length regression achieved comparable mean absolute errors (3 weeks) and good sensitivity (0.67) for detecting preterm birth, despite pronounced class imbalance in the dataset. These results provide a proof of concept for automated prediction of GA at birth from functional MRI, and underscore the value of whole-uterus functional imaging in identifying at-risk pregnancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that manual, high-definition cervical length measurements derived from MRI, not currently routine in clinical practice, offer valuable predictive information. Future work will focus on expanding the cohort size and incorporating additional organ-specific imaging to improve generalisability and predictive performance.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer with Spherical Harmonic Posterior Sampling for High-Fidelity Angular Super-Resolution in Diffusion MRI</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Nan, Taohui Xiao, Ruoyou Wu, Shoujun Yu, Ye Li, Hairong Zheng, Shanshan Wang</p>
            <p>Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct high-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR) data without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in recovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to inadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion Transformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both training and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module (QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates direction-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate directionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse and noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior Sampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by heat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible reconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates oversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or generative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two downstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms existing deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity.

            <h2>Deep Learning-based Techniques for Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Opportunities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murat Temiz, Yongwei Zhang, Yanwei Fu, Chi Zhang, Chenfeng Meng, Orhan Kaplan, Christos Masouros</p>
            <p>This article comprehensively reviews recent developments and research on deep learning-based (DL-based) techniques for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. ISAC, which combines sensing and communication functionalities, is regarded as a key enabler for 6G and beyond networks, as many emerging applications, such as vehicular networks and industrial robotics, necessitate both sensing and communication capabilities for effective operation. A unified platform that provides both functions can reduce hardware complexity, alleviate frequency spectrum congestion, and improve energy efficiency. However, integrating these functionalities on the same hardware requires highly optimized signal processing and system design, introducing significant computational complexity when relying on conventional iterative or optimization-based techniques. As an alternative to conventional techniques, DL-based techniques offer efficient and near-optimal solutions with reduced computational complexity. Hence, such techniques are well-suited for operating under limited computational resources and low latency requirements in real-time systems. DL-based techniques can swiftly and effectively yield near-optimal solutions for a wide range of sophisticated ISAC-related tasks, including waveform design, channel estimation, sensing signal processing, data demodulation, and interference mitigation. Therefore, motivated by these advantages, recent studies have proposed various DL-based approaches for ISAC system design. After briefly introducing DL architectures and ISAC fundamentals, this survey presents a comprehensive and categorized review of state-of-the-art DL-based techniques for ISAC, highlights their key advantages and major challenges, and outlines potential directions for future research.</p>

            <h2>Cross-field SNR Analysis and Tensor Channel Estimation for Multi-UAV Near-field Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Huo, Jian Xiong, Yiyan Wu, Songjie Yang, Bo Liu, Wenjun Zhang</p>
            <p>Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) is key to enhancing spectral efficiency in 6G networks. Leveraging the distributed nature of multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems enables the formation of distributed ELAA, which often operate in the near-field region with spatial sparsity, rendering the conventional far-field plane wave assumption invalid. This paper investigates channel estimation for distributed near-field multi-UAV communication systems. We first derive closed-form signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions under the plane wave model (PWM), spherical wave model (SWM), and a hybrid spherical-plane wave model (HSPWM), also referred to as the cross-field model, within a distributed uniform planar array (UPA) scenario. The analysis shows that HSPWM achieves a good balance between modeling accuracy and analytical tractability. Based on this, we propose two channel estimation algorithms: the spherical-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SD-OMP) and the tensor-OMP. The SD-OMP generalizes the polar domain to jointly consider elevation, azimuth, and range. Under the HSPWM, the channel is naturally formulated as a tensor, enabling the use of tensor-OMP. Simulation results demonstrate that tensor-OMP achieves normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance comparable to SD-OMP, while offering reduced computational complexity and improved scalability.</p>

            <h2>Cross-device Zero-shot Label Transfer via Alignment of Time Series Foundation Model Embeddings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neal G. Ravindra, Arijit Sehanobish</p>
            <p>High-quality, medically validated labels exist for clinical actigraphy data but not for ubiquitous consumer wearables like the Apple Watch. Manually labeling wearables data is expensive and doesn't scale. This paper offers a novel framework that transfers valuable labels from a source domain (e.g., actigraphy) to a target domain (e.g., Apple Watch) without requiring paired data. Instead of working with raw time-series signals, we project both domains into a shared latent embedding space using time-series foundation models (TSFMs) and develop a new framework to align the cross-device representations. Our method, Adversarial Alignment of TSFM Embeddings forces the distributions of source and target embeddings to align within this space, facilitating label transfer across device type.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijie Liu, Weidong Mei, He Sun, Dong Wang, Peilan Wang</p>
            <p>Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI. This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation, based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of training reflections is large.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Rasoul Narimani, Katherine R. Davis, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>By providing the optimal operating point that satisfies both the power flow equations and engineering limits, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is central to the operation of electric power systems. While extensive research efforts have focused on reliably computing high-quality OPF solutions, assessing the feasibility of transitioning between operating points remains challenging since the feasible spaces of OPF problems may consist of multiple disconnected components. It is not possible to transition between operating points in different disconnected components without violating OPF constraints. To identify such situations, this paper introduces an algorithm for certifying the infeasibility of transitioning between two operating points within an OPF feasible space. As an indication of potential disconnectedness, the algorithm first seeks an infeasible point on the line connecting a pair of feasible points. The algorithm then certifies disconnectedness by using convex relaxation and bound tightening techniques to show that all points on the plane that is normal to this line are infeasible. Using this algorithm, we provide the first certifications of disconnected feasible spaces for a variety of OPF test cases.</p>

            <h2>DNN-based Digital Twin Framework of a DC-DC Buck Converter using Spider Monkey Optimization Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tahmin Mahmud, Euzeli Cipriano Dos Santos Jr</p>
            <p>Component ageing is a critical concern in power electronic converter systems (PECSs). It directly impacts the reliability, performance, and operational lifespan of converters used across diverse applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems (RESs) and industrial automation. Therefore, understanding and monitoring component ageing is crucial for developing robust converters and achieving long-term system reliability. This paper proposes a data-driven digital twin (DT) framework for DC-DC buck converters, integrating deep neural network (DNN) with the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm to monitor and predict component degradation. Utilizing a low-power prototype testbed along with empirical and synthetic datasets, the SMO+DNN approach achieves the global optimum in 95% of trials, requires 33% fewer iterations, and results in 80% fewer parameter constraint violations compared to traditional methods. The DNN model achieves $R^2$ scores above 0.998 for all key degradation parameters and accurately forecasts time to failure ($t_{failure}$). In addition, SMO-tuned degradation profile improves the converter's performance by reducing voltage ripple by 20-25% and inductor current ripple by 15-20%.</p>

            <p>The increasing complexity of energy systems due to sector coupling and decarbonization calls for unified modeling frameworks that capture the physical and structural interactions between electricity, gas, and heat networks. This paper presents a graph-based modeling approach for multi-energy systems, where each domain is represented as a layer in a multi-layer graph, and coupling technologies are modeled as inter-layer edges via a dedicated coupling layer. A steady-state solver based on a block-structured Newton-Raphson method is developed to jointly compute flows and state variables across all carriers. The proposed model is tested and validated on a realistic case study based on data from a German distribution network. The results demonstrate convergence, numerical accuracy, and consistent domain interaction, and demonstrate the method's applicability for system-wide analysis and its potential as a foundation for future optimizations in integrated energy systems.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Automatic Generation Control subject to Ramp-Rate-Limits: Anytime Feasibility and Uniform Network-Connectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee</p>
            <p>This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing network of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization solution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus algorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is typically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but they exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL, the generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the optimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily converge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The proposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along with the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the coupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the algorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies that at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the demand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the algorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show that our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from the uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the problem of resource efficiency maximization in an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted communication system under practical transceiver hardware impairments (HWIs). We aim to obtain an optimal tradeoff between system spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), by jointly optimizing the base station (BS) transmit beamforming and the active STAR-RIS beamforming. To tackle the challenges in the fractional objective function, we begin by applying the quadratic transformation method to simplify it into a manageable form. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is then developed to iteratively update the BS and STAR-RIS beamforming coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs better than other baseline schemes in the presence of HWIs. Moreover, the variation of the achievable SE-EE region with different transmit power budgets is analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Green Learning for STAR-RIS mmWave Systems with Implicit CSI</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsiang Huang, Po-Heng Chou, Wan-Jen Huang, Walid Saad, C.-C. Jay Kuo</p>
            <p>In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.</p>

            <p>Continual learning, the ability to acquire and transfer knowledge through a models lifetime, is critical for artificial agents that interact in real-world environments. Biological brains inherently demonstrate these capabilities while operating within limited energy and resource budgets. Achieving continual learning capability in artificial systems considerably increases memory and computational demands, and even more so when deploying on platforms with limited resources. In this work, Genesis, a spiking continual learning accelerator, is proposed to address this gap. The architecture supports neurally inspired mechanisms, such as activity-dependent metaplasticity, to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. It integrates low-precision continual learning parametersand employs a custom data movement strategy to accommodate the sparsely distributed spikes. Furthermore, the architecture features a memory mapping technique that places metaplasticity parameters and synaptic weights in a single address location for faster memory access. Results show that the mean classification accuracy for Genesis is 74.6% on a task-agnostic split-MNIST benchmark with power consumption of 17.08mW in a 65nm technology node.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing the Robustness of Contextual ASR to Varying Biasing Information Volumes Through Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Gu, Zhihao Du, Ying Shi, Shiliang Zhang, Qian Chen, Jiqing Han</p>
            <p>Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level, phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46% on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we simultaneously address the problems of energy optimal and safe motion planning of electric vehicles (EVs) in a data-driven robust optimization framework. Safe maneuvers, especially in urban traffic, are characterized by frequent lateral motions, such as lane changes, overtakes and turning along curved roads. Motivated by our previous work which shows a 3-10 % increase in energy consumption due to lateral motion when an electric vehicle changes its lane once every kilometer while following standard drive cycles, we incorporate vehicle lateral dynamics in the modeling and control synthesis, which is in contrast with most prior works. In the context of safety, we leverage past data of obstacle motion to construct a future occupancy set with probabilistic guarantees, and formulate robust collision avoidance constraints with respect to such an occupancy set using convex programming duality. Consequently, we formulate a finite-horizon optimal control problem subject to robust collision avoidance constraints while penalizing resulting energy consumption, and solve it in a receding horizon fashion. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing energy consumption and collision avoidance via numerical simulations involving curved roads and multiple obstacles. A detailed analysis of energy consumption along different components of EV motion highlights appreciable improvement under the proposed approach.</p>

            <p>Power systems decarbonization are at the focal point of the clean energy transition. While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data, our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission analysis for every California county. Both our algorithm and the California study are open-sourced, providing a foundation for future research on grid emissions, planning, operations, and energy policy.</p>

            <p>Sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICTs). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To achieve this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for six promising technologies enabling 6G, including ISAC, extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), mid-band and terahertz (THz) technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). A survey of the progress in 6G channel research regarding the above six promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. To support testing, optimization and evaluation, existing 6G channel simulators are summarized. Then, BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030 is introduced as an example of a simulator that was developed on the basis of the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology.

            <p>As a key enabler of borderless and ubiquitous connectivity, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSINs) are expected to be a cornerstone of 6G wireless communications. However, the multi-tiered and global-scale nature of SAGSINs also amplifies the security vulnerabilities, particularly due to the hidden, passive eavesdroppers distributed throughout the network. In this paper, we introduce a joint optimization framework for multi-hop relaying in SAGSINs that maximizes the minimum user throughput while ensuring a minimum strictly positive secure connection (SPSC) probability. We first derive a closed-form expression for the SPSC probability and incorporate this into a cross-layer optimization framework that jointly optimizes radio resources and relay routes. Specifically, we propose an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ optimal frequency allocation and power splitting strategy-dividing power levels of data transmission and cooperative jamming. We then introduce a Monte-Carlo relay routing algorithm that closely approaches the performance of the numerical upper-bound method. We validate our framework on testbeds built with real-world dataset.</p>

            <h2>MULTI-SCOUT: Multistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications in 5G and Beyond for Moving Target Detection, Positioning, and Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalin E. Sagduyu, Kemal Davaslioglu, Tugba Erpek, Sastry Kompella, Gustave Anderson, Jonathan Ashdown</p>
            <p>This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are extracted for every target. For a single target, bistatic delays are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account for receiver clock synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.</p>

            <h2>A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Interpretable Cyberattack Detection in AGC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehad Jilan, Niranjana Naveen Nambiar, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Alok Paranjape, Amr Youssef, Deepa Kundur</p>
            <p>Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems, considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Safety-Critical Control of Resilient DC Microgrids with Large-Signal Stability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muratkhan Abdirash, Xiaofan Cui</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and power-electronics interfaces in DC microgrids, coupled with rising cyber threats, necessitates primary controllers that are provably safe, cyber-resilient, and practical. Conventional droop-based methods remain prevalent due to their simplicity, yet their design is largely empirical and conservative, lacking rigorous guarantees. Advanced strategies improve certain aspects, but often sacrifice scalability, robustness, or formal safety. In this work, we propose a Distributed Safety-Critical Controller (DSCC) that systematically integrates global stabilization with formal safety guarantees in a fully decentralized manner. Leveraging control barrier functions and the port-Hamiltonian system theory, the DSCC achieves scalable safe stabilization while preserving real-time implementability. High-fidelity switched-circuit simulations validate the controller's advantages under various contingencies. This framework paves the way for resilient, safety-critical, and scalable control in next-generation DC microgrids.</p>

            <h2>Learning Optimal Crew Dispatch for Grid Restoration Following an Earthquake</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Faezeh Ardali, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>Post-disaster crew dispatch is a critical but computationally intensive task. Traditional mixed-integer linear programming methods often require minutes to several hours to compute solutions, leading to delays that hinder timely decision-making in highly dynamic restoration environments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework that integrates transformer architectures with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to deliver near real-time decision support without compromising solution quality. Crew dispatch is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where transformers capture high-dimensional system states and temporal dependencies, while DRL enables adaptive and scalable decision-making. Earthquake-induced distribution network damage is first characterized using established seismic standards, followed by a scenario generation and reduction pipeline that aggregates probable outcomes into a single geospatial impact map. Conditioned on this map, the proposed framework generates second-level dispatch strategies, trained offline on simulated and historical events and deployed online for rapid response. In addition to substantial runtime improvements, the proposed method enhances system resilience by enabling faster and more effective recovery and restoration. Case studies, particularly on the 2869-bus European gas and power network, demonstrate that the method substantially accelerates restoration while maintaining high-quality solutions, underscoring its potential for practical deployment in large-scale disaster response.</p>

            <h2>Impact on transient stability of self-synchronisation control strategies in grid-forming VSC-based generators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Regulo E. Avila-Martinez, Xavier Guillaud, Javier Renedo, Luis Rouco, Aurelio Garcia-Cerrada, Lukas Sigrist</p>
            <p>Grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) are emerging as a solution for integrating renewable energy resources (RERs) into power systems. GFM-VSCs need a self-synchronisation strategy to ensure that all converters and generators in the power system are in synchronism and they reach the same frequency in steady state. The self-synchronisation strategy in GFM-VSCs that has received most attention in previous research is virtual synchronous machine (VSM) control. However, no systematic study of the effects on transient stability of different variants of this strategy has been carried out in previous work. This paper analyses and compares transient stability of four self-synchronisation strategies for GFM-VSCs: VSM without phase-locked loop (PLL), VSM with PLL, VSM without PLL using wash-out filter and integral-proportional (IP) controller. The paper also analyses two different methods that can \color{black} be applied to GFM-VSC self-synchronisation strategies to improve transient stability: the concept of virtual unsaturated active-power controller (VAPC), proposed in previous work, and an algorithm for frequency limitation in the GFM-VSC (FLC), which is proposed in this paper.</p>

            <p>On 21 June 2024, a severe incident happened in the South-Eastern part of the Continental European power system. After a voltage collapse, large parts of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a blackout [1]. The initial tripping of two transmission lines resulted in a voltage collapse in these countries. Investigations have shown that a) transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event. Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.</p>

            <h2>minPIC: Towards Optimal Power Allocation in Multi-User Interference Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagnik Bhattacharya, Abhiram Rao Gorle, John M. Cioffi</p>
            <p>6G envisions massive cell-free networks with spatially nested multiple access (MAC) and broadcast (BC) channels without centralized coordination. This makes optimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders crucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor receivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as well as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed heuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power inefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC framework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in general multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic SIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing an SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally requiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided sorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex optimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary search. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent high-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the best of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the Pareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the door to scalable interference management in cell-free networks.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decision-Making Strategy Considering User Satisfaction Feedback in Demand Response Program</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Li, Li Ding, Qiao Lin, Zhen-Wei Yu</p>
            <p>Demand response providers (DRPs) are intermediaries between the upper-level distribution system operator and the lower-level participants in demand response (DR) programs. Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</p>

            <h2>On the Smart Coordination of Flexibility Scheduling in Multi-carrier Integrated Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Doh Dinga, Sander van Rijn, Laurens de Vries, Milos Cvetkovic</p>
            <p>Coordinating the interactions between flexibility assets in multi-carrier integrated energy systems (MIES) can lead to an efficient integration of variable renewable energy resources, and a cost-efficient energy transition. However, the proliferation of flexibility assets and their participation in active demand response increases the complexity of coordinating these interactions. This paper introduces different approaches to model the coordination of flexibility scheduling in MIES. We propose a market auction-inspired model coupling approach to address the challenges of preserving the autonomy and privacy of flexibility providers, and the issue of scalability. We benchmark our approach against co-optimization and an iterative price-response method by conducting experiments with varying problem sizes and computing infrastructure. We show that our approach scales well and is suitable for modeling flexibility in large-scale energy systems in a more realistic way. From an optimality standpoint, the flexibility dispatch schedules and electricity prices are ``near-optimal". Our methodology is implemented as a new open-source software, which offers several practical applications. For example, flexibility providers and network operators can couple their models to simulate the interaction between their systems without disclosing confidential information; policy regulators can use it to investigate new market design and regulations to optimize the utilization of flexibility in MIES.</p>

            <p>Power allocation is an important task in wireless communication networks. Classical optimization algorithms and deep learning methods, while effective in small and static scenarios, become either computationally demanding or unsuitable for large and dynamic networks with varying user loads. This letter explores the potential of transformer-based deep learning models to address these challenges. We propose a transformer neural network to jointly predict optimal uplink and downlink power using only user and access point positions. The max-min fairness problem in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output systems is considered. Numerical results show that the trained model provides near-optimal performance and adapts to varying numbers of users and access points without retraining, additional processing, or updating its neural network architecture. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving robust and flexible power allocation for dynamic networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Md Obaidur Rahman, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is considered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited by high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway, system configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets and regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the UK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations of wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases, and conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results reveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by the electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location, market arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors play in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies that subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower LCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.</p>

            <p>We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance. Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly efficient outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangyuan Sun, Ruisheng Diao, Ruiyuan Zeng, Jing Zhang, Jianguo Qian</p>
            <p>With the fast-increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), the voltage support capability of the grid following (GFL) IBRs under low voltage ride through (LVRT) control significantly influences the transient voltage stability of the power system. The existing LVRT adjusts the q-axis current to regulate reactive power injection. However, under a large disturbance, the phase-locked loop (PLL) error invalidates the proportional relationship between the q-axis current and reactive power, consequently causing deviation in the actual reactive power injection of the IBR. Besides, the variation of IBR current, determined by the PLL phase and LVRT, also directly influences the transient voltage. To address this issue, the specific influence of PLL error on active and reactive power injection is first analyzed under LVRT control. In addition, by combining the LVRT and PLL dynamics, the mechanisms of three voltage problems caused by voltage angle coupling are revealed. overvoltage, low voltage, and DC-side overvoltage. The specific scenarios in which these voltage stability problems occur are also obtained by the voltage-vector-triangle graphic. Furthermore, a power angle decoupled LVRT control is proposed to eliminate the influence of voltage angle coupling. Finally, the mechanism analysis and effectiveness of the decoupled LVRT are verified in the case study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taulant Kerci, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the concept of "frequency control strength" as a novel approach to understand how different real-world power systems compare to each other in terms of effectiveness and performance of system-wide frequency control. It presents a comprehensive comparison, based on measurement data, of the frequency control strength of four real-world, renewable-based, synchronous islands power systems, namely Great Britain (GB), All-Island power system (AIPS) of Ireland, and Australia (AUS) mainland and Tasmania (TAS). The strength is evaluated by means of different frequency quality metrics. The common understanding is that the bigger the capacity of a power system, the bigger its robustness with respect to events and contingencies. Here we show that this is not always the case in the context of frequency control. In fact, our study shows that mainland AUS shows the highest frequency control strength during normal operating conditions, whereas the AIPS shows the highest relative frequency control strength for abnormal system conditions. The strength is, in particular, greatly influenced by different regulatory requirements and different system/ancillary services arrangements in each jurisdiction. The paper also provides possible mitigations to improve frequency control strength through grid codes and market rules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter</p>
            <p>Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.</p>

            <p>Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Tunable Controller for Grid Forming Converters towards Critical Services Application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangyadatta Tripathy, Barjeev Tyagi</p>
            <p>This paper demonstrates the key features of a control system applicable to inverter-based resources (IBR), which is based on grid-forming technology. Such resources are classified as grid-forming or grid-following converters based on the type of output with or without grid connection. With rapid growth in the energy sector to adopt carbon-free generation, Grid Forming Converter (GFC) seems suitable for power provision to remote or islanded operation of converters. A fully-fledged bulk power grid based on GFC requires complex control implementation with suitable tuning of its parameters. In this article a broader analysis of synchronous machine and such type of converter is discussed and designed in the MATLAB 2024 environment with its control technique is studied for a closed-loop system under contingencies. A proposed control scheme is developed to understand the frequency minimization problem and the minimization problem is solved using GAMS programming tool. The primary objective function is found to be suitable for minimization of frequency deviation using a mixed control approach. An artificial neural network-based controller is also proposed with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm which augments the research by finding suitable optimal reference for GFM converter in the presence of a grid. A long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is also proposed for the above control and the performance is found to be efficacious.</p>

            <h2>A Mathematical Model of Hybrid Microgrid With Pole Placement Controller Using State Feedback For Stability Improvement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangyadatta Tripathy, Barjeev Tyagi</p>
            <p>This paper presents the development of a mathematical model of a converter state space model for a hybrid microgrid. The hybrid model combines the models of components such as DC-Converters, DC-AC converters, and their individual controllers, as well as loads. The input to the converter is considered a constant DC voltage, assumed to originate from distributed generations like solar, battery storage, or fuel-cells. The converter output is connected to a DC line through an LCL filter. The controller circuitry is designed to regulate the voltage, current, and power from the converter. Sensors are strategically placed to measure the currents, voltages, and power, and calculate the reference pulse signal using PWM for the switch. Similarly, the DC-AC converter is modeled. In the state space domain the converter models is used to design overall microgrid system. A single DC converter has six states and two inputs, with all states as outputs. A single DC-AC converter has thirteen states and three inputs, with all states as outputs. Three such converters of each type are considered to develop the DC microgrid and AC microgrid, which are then combined using mathematical analysis to model a hybrid microgrid. For the hybrid microgrid development, network and load models were also included. Eigenvalue analysis has been conducted to study the small signal stability of the considered system. The complete state space model of the hybrid microgrid has been programmed, and a pole-placement controller has been designed to enhance the stability of the system.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a cascade control structure to address the trajectory tracking problem for quadcopters, ensuring uniform global asymptotic stability of the state tracking error dynamics. An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system, defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwei Guo, Bohan Li, Hankun Wang, Zhihan Li, Shuai Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
            <p>Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.</p>

            <p>Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper. Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Negar Monir, Youssef Ait Si, Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap, Adnane Saoud, Sadegh Soudjani</p>
            <p>We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. For two subsystems, we demonstrate correctness, monotone refinement of guarantees, and that the resulting assumptions are maximal within ball-shaped sets. Additionally, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-time reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples, and a nonlinear DC Microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework in verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihao Lin, Shuo Liu, Zhen Tian, Dezong Zhao, Jianglin Lan</p>
            <p>Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Paths for Adaptive Fly-Scan Microscopy: An Extended Version</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Lu, Thomas F. Lynn, Ming Du, Zichao Di, Sven Leyffer</p>
            <p>In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs, and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the next scan iteration.</p>

            <h2>RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiucheng Wang, Qiming Zhang, Nan Cheng</p>
            <p>Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.</p>

            <h2>From Evaluation to Optimization: Neural Speech Assessment for Downstream Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Tsao</p>
            <p>The evaluation of synthetic and processed speech has long been a cornerstone of audio engineering and speech science. Although subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for assessing perceptual quality and intelligibility, their high cost, time requirements, and limited scalability present significant challenges in the rapid development cycles of modern speech technologies. Traditional objective metrics, while computationally efficient, often exhibit weak correlation with human perception, creating a perceptual gap between system optimization and actual user experience. Bridging this gap requires speech assessment models that are more closely aligned with human perception. In recent years, numerous neural network-based speech assessment models have been developed to predict quality and intelligibility, achieving promising results. Beyond their role in evaluation, these models are increasingly integrated into downstream speech processing tasks. This review focuses on their role in two main areas: (1) serving as differentiable perceptual proxies that not only assess but also guide the optimization of speech enhancement and synthesis models; and (2) enabling the detection of salient speech characteristics to support more precise and efficient downstream processing. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline future research directions to further advance the integration of speech assessment into speech processing pipelines.</p>

            <p>Pre-trained models, especially self-supervised learning (SSL) models, have demonstrated impressive results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. While most applications of SSL models focus on leveraging continuous representations as features for training downstream tasks, the utilization of discrete units has gained increasing attention in recent years owing to its lower storage requirements and broader range of applications. In multilingual ASR tasks, representations at different layers of the model contribute differently to various languages, complicating the unification of discrete unit modeling. In this paper, we propose a two-stage training strategy to improve the discrete token performance of pre-trained models and narrow the gap with continuous representation performance. We validate our method on the XLS-R model following the settings of Interspeech2024 Speech Processing Using Discrete Speech Unit Challenge. Our method demonstrates a significant improvement on the ML-SUPERB dataset, achieving a 44% relative reduction on CER for the XLS-R model. This surpasses the previous baseline set by the WavLM model, which achieves a 26% relative reduction on CER. Furthermore, our method achieves the first place among all the single-system results on the leaderboard.</p>

            <p>Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention, environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems. Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during this http URL this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver configurations and deployments.</p>

            <p>Stress has emerged as a critical global health issue, contributing to cardiovascular disorders, depression, and several other long-term illnesses. Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing importance. In this work, we propose a stress prediction framework based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during multiple daily activities such as sitting, walking, and jogging. Frequency-domain indicators of autonomic nervous system activity were obtained through Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis and utilized as input for machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG signals. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based classifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model provided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies in ECG data. Overall, the findings suggest that integrating frequency-domain feature extraction with advanced learning algorithms enhances stress prediction and paves the way for real-time healthcare monitoring solutions.</p>

            <p>We aim to develop a technology that makes the sound from earphones and headphones easier to hear without increasing the sound pressure or eliminating ambient noise. To this end, we focus on harnessing the phenomenon of binaural unmasking through phase reversal in one ear. Specifically, we conduct experiments to evaluate the improvement of audibility caused by the phenomenon, using conditions that approximate practical scenarios. We use speech sounds by various speakers, including women, and noises that can be encountered in daily life (urban environmental sounds, cheers) to verify the effects of binaural unmasking under conditions close to practical situations. The results of experiments using the Japanese language showed that (i) speech in a noisy environment is perceived to be up to about 6 dB louder with phase reversal in one ear, and (ii) a certain effect (improvement of audibility by 5 dB or more) is obtained for all speakers and noises targeted in this study. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of binaural unmasking attributed to interaural phase differences in practical scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thai-Hoc Vu, Anh-Tu Le, Ngo Hoang Tu, Tan N. Nguyen, Miroslav Voznak</p>
            <p>This work investigates the covertness and security performance of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments. Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance. Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA) in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements, and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures. Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.</p>

            <p>Speech Recognition has seen a dramatic shift towards adopting Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is partly driven by good scalability properties demonstrated by LLMs, ability to leverage large amounts of labelled, unlabelled speech and text data, streaming capabilities with auto-regressive framework and multi-tasking with instruction following characteristics of LLMs. However, simple next-token prediction objective, typically employed with LLMs, have certain limitations in performance and challenges with hallucinations. In this paper, we propose application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable reinforcement learning from human feedback for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We design simple rule based reward functions to guide the policy updates. We demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate (upto 18.4% relative), reduction in hallucinations, increased robustness on out-of-domain datasets and effectiveness in domain adaptation.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor (ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF, known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations; however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting their potential utility in ASF correction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehra Yigit, Sefa Kayraklik, Ertugrul Basar, Ali Gorcin</p>
            <p>The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target: eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.</p>

            <h2>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Based Task-Driven MIMO System for Image Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijiang Li, Rongqing Zhang, Xiang Cheng, Jian Tang</p>
            <p>To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while maintaining identical communication overhead.</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive Analysis and Exclusion Hypothesis of $α$-Approximation Method for Discretizing Analog Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shen Chen, Jisong Wang, Dejun Liu, Jiaxi Ying, Shuai Wang</p>
            <p>A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain) into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range. This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing amplitude and phase distortion.</p>

            <h2>Environment-Aware Channel Measurement and Modeling for Terahertz Monostatic Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yejian Lyu, Zhiqiang Yuan, Henk Wymeersch, Chong Han</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at 300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios. Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle, are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling (CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g., structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics, offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.</p>

            <h2>Robust Load Disturbance Rejection in PWM DC-DC Buck Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Pirrera, Francesco Gabriele, Davide Lena, Fabio Pareschi, Diego Regruto, Gianluca Setti</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach to robust load disturbance rejection in DC-DC Buck converters. We propose a novel control scheme based on the design of two nested feedback loops. First, we design the controller in the outer loop using H infinity optimal control theory, and we show, by means of mu-analysis, that such a controller provides robust stability in the presence of uncertainty affecting the physical parameters of the circuit. Then, we introduce an inner feedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As far as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load estimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the insertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire control system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures based on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC in terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are discussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the implementation of the proposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect to the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters.</p>

            <h2>Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing for High-Mobility Wireless Communications Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanfang Ma, Zulin Wang, Peng Yuan, Qin Huang, Yuanhan Ni</p>
            <p>Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been regarded as a candidate integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) waveform owing to its superior communication performance, outperforming the Orthogonal Time-Frequency Space (OTFS) that has been researched for a longer time. However, since the above two waveforms are incompatible with each other, the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS may not be directly applicable to AFDM. This paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D) transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution, which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the 2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Implementing General-Order Frequency Dynamic Response Model and Frequency Excursion Duration Criterion in Unit Commitment Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Rajabdorri, Bo Zhou, Lukas Sigrist, Enrique Lobato</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel approach for incorporating frequency dynamics into the unit commitment (UC) problem through a general-order differential equation model, solved using Bernstein polynomial approximation. Traditional frequency-constrained UC (FCUC) models typically rely on simplified first-order assumptions or scalar frequency metrics, such as frequency nadir, to indirectly enforce dynamic behavior. In contrast, our formulation explicitly models time-domain frequency response using second-order dynamics, enabling a more accurate and flexible representation of generator behavior. The resulting differential equations are approximated with high fidelity using Bernstein polynomials, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that remains computationally tractable for small-scale power systems. Additionally, we introduce a new constraint based on the duration of frequency excursions below a critical threshold, motivated by practical concerns such as relay operation and equipment protection. A data-driven method is employed to relate the area under this threshold-computed as the integral of the Bernstein approximation-to the duration of frequency deviation. The proposed framework is validated using real-world data from an island system in Spain, demonstrating enhanced frequency security with a moderate increase in operational cost. These results suggest the method's strong potential for application in low-inertia, small-scale power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salmane Naoumi, Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Marwa Chafii</p>
            <p>This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Ali Hosseini, Dragan Kostić, S. Hassan HosseinNia</p>
            <p>Reset elements are nonlinear filters that improve control performance beyond linear time-invariant (LTI) limits but introduce higher-order harmonics that complicate design. Although frequency-domain tools like describing functions (DFs) and higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions (HOSIDFs) analyze reset control systems (RCS), no direct method yet quantifies the impact of higher-order harmonics on the error signal without time-domain simulations. This paper introduces a robustness factor, $\sigma_2(\omega)$, which quantifies the increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the error signal due to HOSIDFs, enabling RCS to rely solely on first-order DF characteristics while accounting for nonlinear effects. By using this robustness factor, a systematic method for designing pre- and post-filters is developed to ensure a predefined bound on $\sigma_2(\omega)$, thereby limiting the influence of higher-order harmonics without altering first-order DF behavior. The proposed framework is validated through a case study on a planar precision positioning stage, demonstrating how the robustness factor guides the reduction of nonlinearities and improves performance predictability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.L.T.C. Jansen, E. Petri, M. van Berkel, W.P.M.H. Heemels</p>
            <p>In reactor-grade tokamaks, pellet injection is the best candidate for core plasma fuelling. However, density control schemes that can handle the hybrid nature of this type of fuelling, i.e., the discrete impact of the pellets on the continuously evolving plasma density, are lacking. This paper proposes a neuromorphic controller, inspired by the integrate-and-fire neuronal model, to address this problem. The overall system is modelled as a hybrid system, and we analyse the proposed controller in closed loop with a single-input single-output linear time-invariant plasma model. The controller generates spikes, representing pellet launches, when the neuron variable reaches a certain threshold. Between the control actions, or spikes, the system evolves in open loop. We establish conditions on the controller variables and minimum actuator speed, depending on the reference value for the desired density, the pellet size and the time-constant of the plasma density, that guarantee a practical stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are illustrated in a numerical example.</p>

            <p>Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements. Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs and widely spaced user antennas.</p>

            <p>We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96 percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 123 system.</p>

            <p>This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization of a class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems. First, we consider a bounded matched perturbation in its linear form. It is shown that by using a set-valued function, both the convergence objective (finite-time) and the rejection of perturbations are achieved. Second, we consider a class of nonlinear systems and design a feedback control that ensures the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. All proofs presented in this paper regarding convergence are based on Lyapunov theory. The existence of solutions to the closed-loop system and its well-posedness are established using maximal monotone theory. To illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results, a heat equation is considered as an application of the main results.</p>

The LNA is a crucial component in the performance of receivers, particularly in integrated receivers. The proposed LNA was designed to meet the specifications of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Post-layout simulation results, including pads with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, are as follows: gain of 10.7 dB, noise figure of 2.7 dB, third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of 0.9 dBm, input and output impedance matching better than -20 dB with respect to 50~$\Omega$ terminations, with a power consumption of 505 $\mu$W powered from a 1.2 V supply. The obtained results fall within the range of those recently reported for the same topology and operating frequency.

The pipeline integrates: (i) a modular universal decoder robust to vibration-induced noise, chemical delay, and single-tap intersymbol interference; (ii) a lightweight pilot-only synchronizer that estimates symbol intervals; and (iii) a virtual-response generator that augments data and scales symbol duration. Experiments across multiple chips and sessions demonstrate end-to-end chemical text transmission with consistent error-rate reductions compared to naive thresholding and standard neural baselines.

After a voltage collapse, large parts of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a blackout [1].

Investigations have shown that a) transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event. Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.</p>

            <p>Ensuring the stability of wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with nonlinear and control-non-affine dynamics, where system behavior is nonlinear with respect to both states and control decisions, poses a significant challenge, particularly under limited resources. However, it is essential in the context of 6G, which is expected to support reliable communication to enable real-time autonomous systems. This paper proposes a joint communication and control solution consisting of: i) a deep Koopman model capable of learning and mapping complex nonlinear dynamics into linear representations in an embedding space, predicting missing states, and planning control actions over a future time horizon; and ii) a scheduling algorithm that schedules sensor-controller communication based on Lyapunov optimization, which dynamically allocates communication resources based on system stability and available resources. Control actions are computed within this embedding space using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure system stability. The proposed model is evaluated under varying conditions and its performance is compared against two baseline models; one that assumes systems are control-affine, and another that assumes identical control actions in the embedding and original spaces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both baselines, by achieving stability while requiring fewer transmissions.</p>

Based on this metric, we analyze the design principles of AI-integrated 6G networks from the perspective of three critical AI elements, namely computing power, model and data. Case studies validate TREE's unique capability to expose energy-service asymmetries in hybrid traffic scenarios where conventional metrics prove inadequate. Although it is impossible to determine every design detail of AI-integrated 6G network at current time, we believe that the proposed TREE based framework will help the network operators to quantify the operating energy cost of AI services and continue to evolve towards sustainable 6G networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Guo, Junshan Luo, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding, Shilian Wang, Zhenhai Xu</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation, etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.</p>

            <p>The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA) techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques better exploit their interference management capability beyond the communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted ISAC.</p>

            <h2>Frequency-Domain Characterization of Load Demand from Electrified Highways</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutossh Gupta, Vassilis Kekatos, Ruoyu Yang, Dionysios Aliprantis, Steve Pekarek</p>
            <p>Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of these insights.</p>

            <h2>Know What, Know Why: Semantic Hazard Communication for Intelligent V2X Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Sun, Wenqi Zhang, Bizhu Wang, Xiaodong Xu, Chau Yuen, Yan Zhang, Ping Zhang</p>
            <p>In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units (RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation. Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through" feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces unnecessary deceleration.</p>

            <h2>HyDeFuse: Provably Convergent Denoiser-Driven Hyperspectral Fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagar Kumar, Unni V S, Kunal Narayan Chaudhury</p>
            <p>Hyperspectral (HS) images provide fine spectral resolution but have limited spatial resolution, whereas multispectral (MS) images capture finer spatial details but have fewer bands. HS-MS fusion aims to integrate HS and MS images to generate a single image with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This is commonly formulated as an inverse problem with a linear forward model. However, reconstructing high-quality images using the forward model alone is challenging, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. Over the years, numerous methods have been developed, including wavelets, total variation, low-rank models, and deep neural networks. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of denoiser-driven regularization, where a powerful off-the-shelf denoiser is used for implicit regularization within an iterative algorithm. This approach has shown promise but remains relatively underexplored in hyperspectral imaging. Our focus is on a crucial aspect of denoiser-driven algorithms: ensuring convergence of the iterations. It is known that powerful denoisers can produce high-quality reconstructions, but they are also prone to instability and can cause the iterations to diverge. The challenge is to design denoisers that come with a convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose a denoiser-driven fusion algorithm, HyDeFuse, which leverages a class of pseudo-linear denoisers for implicit regularization. We demonstrate how the contraction mapping theorem can be applied to establish global linear convergence of HyDeFuse. Additionally, we introduce enhancements to the denoiser that significantly improve the performance of HyDeFuse, making it competitive with state-of-the-art techniques. We validate our theoretical results and present fusion results on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the performance of HyDeFuse.</p>

            <h2>LLM-Enhanced Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Halvin Yang, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Mahsa Derakhshani, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI), undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces, can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack. Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens. This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation, charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.</p>

            <p>Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness. We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential, visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.</p>

            <p>Despite significant advancements in music generation systems, the methodologies for evaluating generated music have not progressed as expected due to the complex nature of music, with aspects such as structure, coherence, creativity, and emotional expressiveness. In this paper, we shed light on this research gap, introducing a detailed taxonomy for evaluation metrics for both audio and symbolic music representations. We include a critical review identifying major limitations in current evaluation methodologies which includes poor correlation between objective metrics and human perception, cross-cultural bias, and lack of standardization that hinders cross-model comparisons. Addressing these gaps, we further propose future research directions towards building a comprehensive evaluation framework for music generation evaluation.</p>

            <p>Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a variety of signal representation tasks.</p>

            <h2>Privacy, Informed Consent and the Demand for Anonymisation of Smart Meter Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurab Chhachhi, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains. Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of informed consent under current regulations. We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary (willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary (willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications. On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings, underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions.</p>

            <p>We consider a specific scenario of text aggregation, in the realm of musical harmonization. Musical harmonization shares similarities with text aggregation, however the language of harmony is more structured than general text. Concretely, given a set of harmonization suggestions for a given musical melody, our interest lies in devising aggregation algorithms that yield an harmonization sequence that satisfies the following two key criteria: (1) an effective representation of the collective suggestions; and (2) an harmonization that is musically coherent. We present different algorithms for the aggregation of harmonies given by a group of agents and analyze their complexities. The results indicate that the Kemeny and plurality-based algorithms are most effective in assessing representation and maintaining musical coherence.</p>

            <p>Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p>

            <h2>Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cramér Distance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uwe D. Hanebeck</p>
            <p>We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cramér distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.</p>

            <p>Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever. Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end architectures.</p>

We find a particularly strong relevance of the convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks. The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further exploration.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nader Shakibay Senobari</p>
            <p>Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</p>

            <p>Generative modeling offers new opportunities for bioacoustics, enabling the synthesis of realistic animal vocalizations that could support biomonitoring efforts and supplement scarce data for endangered species. However, directly generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major challenge. We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training enhancement methods. We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fréchet Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226), and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species exceeding 70% accuracy. These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.</p>

            <p>Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Tian, Chi Kit Ng, Hongliang Ren</p>
            <p>Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.</p>

We conducted comprehensive experiments on three representative models using two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively adapt to various generator architectures without altering their structure, thereby unlocking further performance gains in speech enhancement across different scenarios.</p>

            <p>Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent through the budget constraint. We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state, finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.</p>

            <p>Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arman Javan Sekhavat Pishkhani (University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran)</p>
            <p>This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges, ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.</p>

            <h2>Safe and Efficient Lane-Changing for Autonomous Vehicles: An Improved Double Quintic Polynomial Approach with Time-to-Collision Evaluation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Bai, Rui Xu, Teng Rui, Jiale Liu, Qi Wei Oung, Hoi Leong Lee, Zhen Tian, Fujiang Yuan</p>
            <p>Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shafayet M. Anik, D.G. Perera</p>
            <p>Real-time frequency analysis of musical instruments, such as the piano, is an essential feature in areas like electronic tuners, music visualizers, and live sound monitoring. Traditional methods often rely on software-based digital signal processing (DSP), which may introduce latency and require significant computational power. In contrast, hardware platforms such as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) offer the ability to perform such analyses with greater speed and determinism due to their parallel processing capabilities. The primary objective of this project was to analyze analog audio signals from a digital piano using an FPGA-based real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) system.</p>

            <p>Extensive research has already been conducted in the autonomous driving field to help vehicles navigate safely and efficiently. At the same time, plenty of current research on vulnerable road user (VRU) safety is performed which largely concentrates on perception, localization, or trajectory prediction of VRUs. However, existing research still exhibits several gaps, including the lack of a unified planning and collision avoidance system for autonomous vehicles, limited investigation into delay tolerant control strategies, and the absence of an efficient and standardized testing methodology. Ensuring VRU safety remains one of the most pressing challenges in autonomous driving, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. In this two year project, we focused on applying the Vehicle in Virtual Environment (VVE) method to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate safety functions for Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) using automated steering and braking of ADS. In this current second year project report, our primary focus was on enhancing the previous year results while also considering bicyclist safety.</p>

            <h2>A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Tian, Zhihao Lin, Dezong Zhao, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Qiyuan Wang, Wenjing Zhao, Xiaodan Wang, Chongfeng Wei</p>
            <p>Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p>

            <h2>The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashwin Nagarajan, Hao-Wen Dong</p>
            <p>Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning, which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens. Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Zheng, Zeyu Xie, Xuenan Xu, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Mengyue Wu</p>
            <p>Controllable text-to-audio generation (TTA) has attracted much attention recently. Although existing works can achieve fine-grained controllability based on timestamp information, sound event categories are limited to a fixed set. Moreover, since only simulated data is used for training, the generated audio quality and generalization performance on real data are limited. To tackle this issue, we propose PicoAudio2, improving temporal-controllable TTA via a new data processing pipeline and model architecture. Specifically, we use a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation data. Moreover, following PicoAudio, we encode timestamp information into a timestamp matrix to provide extra fine-grained time-aligned information to the model, on top of the coarse-grained textual description. Experiments show that PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability and audio quality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baris Ata, Yaosheng Xu</p>
            <p>Bipartite matching systems arise in many settings where agents or tasks from two distinct sets must be paired dynamically under compatibility constraints. We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gyehun Go, Satbyul Han, Ahyeon Choi, Eunjin Choi, Juhan Nam, Jeong Mi Park</p>
            <p>Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.</p>

            <p>Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C, DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban environments.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04% accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM) validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and hands-free control interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Huang, Zining Cao</p>
            <p>Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a case study.</p>

            <p>The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA) arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems, fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.</p>

            <p>In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Cloud Computing (CC) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18 while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing intrusion detection systems in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Empowered Secure Near-Field MIMO Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaodong Ma, Kai Liu, Yanming Liu, Lipeng Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper. To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm. Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization (MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition, the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.</p>

            <p>Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Denoising and Adaptation Framework for Self-Supervised Bengali Dialectal ASR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swadhin Biswas, Imran, Tuhin Sheikh</p>
            <p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Bengali, the world's fifth most spoken language, remains a significant challenge, critically hindering technological accessibility for its over 270 million speakers. This challenge is compounded by two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal diversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments. While state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR for low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle environmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies for the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This paper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual challenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is uniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it inherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage fine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard Bengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently specializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data augmentation. The framework is rigorously evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising multiple Bengali dialects under a wide range of simulated noisy conditions, from clean audio to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and the large-scale multilingual Whisper model. This work establishes a new state-of-the-art for this task and provides a scalable, effective blueprint for developing practical ASR systems for other low-resource, high-variation languages globally.</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Is Noisy Data a Blessing in Disguise? A Distributionally Robust Optimization Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chung-Han Hsieh, Rong Gan</p>
            <p>Noisy data are often viewed as a challenge for decision-making. This paper studies a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that shows how such noise can be systematically incorporated. Rather than applying DRO to the noisy empirical distribution, we construct ambiguity sets over the \emph{latent} distribution by centering a Wasserstein ball at the noisy empirical distribution in the observation space and taking its inverse image through a known noise kernel. We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a tractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical guarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency. Crucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a ``blessing in disguise." Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its direct counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price of ambiguity. In the context of fair resource allocation problems, we demonstrate that this robust approach can induce solutions that are structurally more equitable. Our findings suggest that managers can leverage uncertainty by harnessing noise as a source of robustness rather than treating it as an obstacle, producing more robust and strategically balanced decisions.</p>

            <p>Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.</p>

As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim- iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.</p>

            <h2>DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junxiang Liu, Junming Lin, Jiangtong Li, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</p>

            <h2>On a closed-loop identification challenge in feedback optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Lindbäck Løvland, Lars Struen Imsland, Bjarne Grimstad</p>
            <p>Feedback optimization has emerged as an effective strategy for steady-state optimization of dynamical systems. By exploiting models of the steady-state input-output sensitivity, methods of this type are often sample efficient, and their use of feedback ensures that they are robust against model error. Still, this robustness has its limitations, and the dependence on a model may hinder convergence in settings with high model error. We investigate here the effect of a particular type of model error: bias due to identifying the model from closed-loop data. Our main results are a sufficient convergence condition, and a converse divergence condition. The convergence condition requires a matrix which depends on the closed-loop sensitivity and a noise-to-signal ratio of the data generating system to be positive definite. The negative definiteness of the same matrix characterizes an extreme case where the bias due to closed-loop data results in divergence of model-based feedback optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenyang Le, Bing Han, Jinshun Li, Songyong Chen, Yanmin Qian</p>
            <p>Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.</p>

            <p>This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of more effective generative speech models.</p>

            <p>Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses (IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs, CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

            <p>Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns, ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods. While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments. ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional performance and accessibility for real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Gerald Dcruz, Argyrios Zolotas, Niall Ross Greenwood, Miguel Arana-Catania</p>
            <p>With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Poltronieri, Xavier Serra, Martín Rocamora</p>
            <p>Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing. The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord labels from decomposed outputs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Einstein Rivas Pizarro, Wajiha Zaheer, Li Yang, Khalil El-Khatib, Glenn Harvel</p>
            <p>Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p>

            <p>Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.</p>

            <p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Ampères, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.</p>

            <p>Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.</p>

A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max T.M. Ng, Roman Engelhardt, Florian Dandl, Hani S. Mahmassani, Klaus Bogenberger</p>
            <p>This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service.

            <h2>Hybrid Autonomy Framework for a Future Mars Science Helicopter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Di Pierno, Robert Hewitt, Stephan Weiss, Roland Brockers</p>
            <p>Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration, integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and extending beyond aerial robotics.</p>

            <h2>FireRedTTS-2: Towards Long Conversational Speech Generation for Podcast and Chatbot</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Xie, Feiyu Shen, Junjie Li, Fenglong Xie, Xu Tang, Yao Hu</p>
            <p>Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover, they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable, natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new 12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers. Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness with context-consistent prosody.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jintao Liang, Pablo G. Madoery, Chung-Horng Lung, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Gunes Karabulut Kurt</p>
            <p>Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite networks.</p>

The proposed method adjusts observer gains based on the estimated state to achieve fast convergence and low noise sensitivity in state estimation. A Lyapunov-based analysis ensures stability and accuracy, while simulations using vision-based sensor data validate the approach under realistic conditions. Compared to classical observers with time-invariant gains, the proposed method enhances trajectory tracking precision and reduces control input switching, making it a promising solution for autonomous spacecraft localization and control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Felipe Chary, Miguel Arjona Ramirez</p>
            <p>We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler, single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4 patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid. To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open foundation for future low-latency codec designs.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&CNET) accelerated using memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.</p>

            <h2>Constrained Stabilization on the n-Sphere with Conic and Star-shaped Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mayur Sawant, Abdelhamid Tayebi</p>
            <p>The problem of constrained stabilization on the n-sphere under star-shaped constraints is considered. We propose a control strategy that allows to almost globally steer the state to a desired location while avoiding star-shaped constraints on the n-sphere. Depending on the state's proximity to the unsafe regions, the state is either guided towards the target location along the geodesic connecting the target to the state or steered towards the antipode of a predefined point lying in the interior of the nearest unsafe region. We prove that the target location is almost globally asymptotically stable under the proposed continuous, time-invariant feedback control law. Nontrivial simulation results on the 2-sphere and the 3-sphere demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</p>

            <p>Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games. Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games and quadratic Gaussian game setups.</p>

            <h2>Topology Inference for Network Systems with Unknown Inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing Jiao, Yushan Li, Jianping He</p>
            <p>Topology inference is a powerful tool to better understand the behaviours of network systems (NSs). Different from most of prior works, this paper is dedicated to inferring the directed topology of NSs from noisy observations, where the nodes are influenced by unknown time-varying inputs. These inputs can be actively injected signals by the user, intrinsic system noises or extrinsic environment interference. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a two-stage inference scheme to overcome the influence of the inputs. First, by leveraging the second-order difference of the state evolution, we establish a judging criterion to detect the input injection time and provide the probability guarantees. With this injection time to determine available observations, an initial topology is accordingly inferred to further facilitate the input estimation. Second, utilizing the stability characteristic of the system response, a recursive input filtering algorithm is designed to approximate the zero-input response, which directly reflects the topology structure. Then, we construct a decreasing-weight based optimization problem to infer the final network topology from the approximated response. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p>This study addresses the task of performing robust and reliable time-delay estimation in signals in noisy and reverberating environments. In contrast to the popular signal processing based methods, this paper proposes to transform the input signals using a deep neural network into another pair of sequences which show high cross correlation at the actual time delay. This is achieved with the help of a novel correlation function based objective function for training the network. The proposed approach is also intrinsically interpretable as it does not lose temporal information. Experimental evaluations are performed for estimating mutual time delays for different types of audio signals such as pulse, speech and musical beats. SyncNet outperforms other classical approaches, such as GCC-PHAT, and some other learning based approaches.</p>

By formulating all these results for both discrete- and continuous-time systems, we develop specialized distributed implementations that, up to this point, were only available for networks modeled as discrete-time systems.</p>

            <p>Real-world network systems are inherently dynamic, with network topologies undergoing continuous changes over time. Previous works often focus on static networks or rely on complete prior knowledge of evolving topologies, whereas real-world networks typically undergo stochastic structural changes that are difficult to predict in advance. To address this challenge, we define the adaptive control problem and propose an adaptive control algorithm to reduce the extra control cost caused by driver node switching. We introduce a node-level adaptive control metric to capture both the stability and consistency of each node across historical topologies. By integrating this metric with a partial matching repair strategy, our algorithm adjusts the minimum driver node set in real time at each snapshot, while minimizing unnecessary reconfigurations between consecutive time steps. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world dynamic networks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithm, reducing the switching cost by an average of 22% in synthetic networks and 19\% in real-world networks, without requiring foreknowledge of the future evolution of the network. These findings extend the theoretical scope of dynamic network controllability and open new avenues for practical applications in transportation, social, and molecular regulatory systems.</p>

            <p>Chest X-rays remain the primary diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, yet their limited ability to capture fine anatomical details can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. To address this, we introduce XVertNet, a novel deep-learning framework designed to enhance vertebral structure visualization in X-ray images significantly. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) An unsupervised learning architecture that eliminates reliance on manually labeled training data a persistent bottleneck in medical imaging, and (2) a dynamic self-tuned internal guidance mechanism featuring an adaptive feedback loop for real-time image optimization. Extensive validation across four major public datasets revealed that XVertNet outperforms state-of-the-art enhancement methods, as demonstrated by improvements in entropy scores, Tenengrad criterion values, the local phase coherence sharpness index (LPC-SI), and thetone mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, clinical validation conducted with two board-certified radiologists confirmed that the enhanced images enabled more sensitive detection of subtle vertebral fractures and degenerative changes. The unsupervised nature of XVertNet facilitates immediate clinical deployment without requiring additional training overhead. This innovation represents a transformative advancement in emergency radiology, providing a scalable and time-efficient solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy in high-pressure clinical environments.</p>

In this paper, the disturbance model is generalized to a nonlinear static function of the plant's state and command input, learned online, so as to perfectly track time-varying reference trajectories under certain assumptions on the model and provided that future reference samples are available.

To address these challenges with a unified solution, we propose the Voice Conversion Augmentation (VCA) strategy to obtain pseudo speech from the training set. Furthermore, to guarantee generation quality, we designed the VCA-NN~(nearest neighbours) strategy to select source speech from utterances that are close to the target speech in the representation space. Our experimental results on three created datasets demonstrated that VCA-NN effectively mitigates these dataset problems, which provides a new direction for handling the speaker recognition problems from the data aspect.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel Koopman composition operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to the well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. Consequently, our proposed framework allows for arbitrarily accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.</p>

            <p>The harsh environment and scarce resources post-disaster drive the equipment to be miniaturized and portable. Based on this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems play a significant role in providing emergency wireless networks. In order to reduce the hardware cost, a hybrid beamforming (HBF) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, which exploits the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains, is considered in this paper. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom, thus leading to increased interference among communication users and radar sensing. To solve this problem, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is adopted to enhance the emergency mmWave-ISAC system. We formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization objective by jointly designing common rate allocation and HBF. Then, we propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.</p>

This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.</p>

            <p>Training a high-quality Federated Learning (FL) model at the network edge is challenged by limited transmission resources. Although various device scheduling strategies have been proposed, it remains unclear how scheduling decisions affect the FL model performance under temporal constraints. This is pronounced when the wireless medium is shared to enable the participation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with distinct communication modes: (1) a scheduling (pull) scheme, that selects devices with valuable updates, and (2) random access (push), in which interested devices transmit model parameters. This work investigates the interplay of push-pull interactions in a time-constrained FL setting, where the communication opportunities are finite, with a utility-based analytical model. Using real-world datasets, we provide a performance tradeoff analysis that validates the significance of strategic device scheduling under push-pull wireless access for several practical settings.

            <p>Future wireless networks are envisioned to facilitate the seamless coexistence of communication and sensing functionalities, thereby enabling the much-touted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. A key challenge in ISAC is managing inter-functionality interference while maintaining a balanced performance trade-off. In this work, we propose a rate-splitting (RS)-inspired approach to address this challenge in an uplink ISAC scenario, where a base station (BS) serves an uplink communication user while detecting a radar target. We derive inner bounds on the ergodic data information rate for the communication user and the ergodic radar estimation information rate for the sensing target. A closed-form solution is also derived for the optimal power split in RS that maximizes the communication user's performance. Compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA)- and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired approaches, the proposed approach achieves a more favorable sensing-communication trade-off by virtue of the decoding order flexibility introduced through splitting the communication message. Notably, this is the first work to employ an RS-inspired strategy as a general framework for non-orthogonal coexistence of sensing and communication, extending its applicability beyond traditional digital-only settings.</p>

Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</p>

            <h2>Acceleration and Parallelization Methods for ISRS EGN Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruiyang Xia, Guanjun Gao, Zanshan Zhao, Haoyu Wang, Kun Wen, Daobin Wang</p>
            <p>The enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model, which accounts for inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), has been extensively utilized for evaluating nonlinear interference (NLI) within the C+L band. Compared to closed-form expressions and machine learning-based NLI evaluation models, it demonstrates broader applicability and its accuracy is not dependent on the support of large-scale datasets. However, its high computational complexity often results in lengthy computation times. Through analysis, the high-frequency oscillations of the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency factor integrand were identified as a primary factor limiting the computational speed of the ISRS EGN model. To address this issue, we propose an approximation method to derive a closed-form expression for the FWM efficiency factor, which provides both high accuracy and high computational efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the method proposed in this work could achieve low error levels under high ISRS influence levels, with an absolute mean error (MAE) of approximately 0.0033 dB. Furthermore, a parallel computation strategy targeting independent regions within the integration domain is proposed and optimized, which further significantly improves computing efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Fixed-Time Input-to-State Stability for Singularly Perturbed Systems via Composite Lyapunov Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda</p>
            <p>We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</p>

            <h2>A Review of Hydrogen-Enabled Resilience Enhancement for Multi-Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Yu, Haoyu Fang, Goran Strbac, Dawei Qiu, Dong Yue, Xiaohong Guan, Gerhard P. Hancke</p>
            <p>Ensuring resilience in multi-energy systems (MESs) becomes both more urgent and more challenging due to the rising occurrence and severity of extreme events (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyber-physical attacks). Among many measures of strengthening MES resilience, the integration of hydrogen shows exceptional potential in cross-temporal flexibility, cross-spatial flexibility, cross-sector flexibility, and black start capability. Although many hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement measures have been developed, the current literature lacks a systematic overview of hydrogen-enabled resilience enhancement in MESs. To fill the research gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement. First, advantages and challenges of adopting hydrogen in MES resilience enhancement are summarized. Then, we propose a resilience enhancement framework for hydrogen-enabled MESs. Under the proposed framework, existing resilience metrics and event-oriented contingency models are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, we classify hydrogen-enabled planning measures by the types of hydrogen-related facilities and provide some insights for planning problem formulation frameworks. Moreover, we categorize the hydrogen-enabled operation enhancement measures into three operation response stages: preventive, emergency, and restoration. Finally, we identify some research gaps and point out possible future directions in aspects of comprehensive resilience metric design, temporally-correlated event-targeted scenario generation, multi-type temporal-spatial cyber-physical contingency modeling under compound extreme events, multi-network multi-timescale coordinated planning and operation, low-carbon resilient planning and operation, and large language model-assisted whole-process resilience enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Modulo Sampling: Performance Guarantees in The Presence of Quantization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neil Irwin Bernardo, Shaik Basheeruddin Shah, Yonina C. Eldar</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the dynamic range and quantization noise power in modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Two modulo ADC systems are considered: (1) a modulo ADC which outputs the folded samples and an additional 1-bit folding information signal, and (2) a modulo ADC without the 1-bit information. A recovery algorithm that unfolds the quantized modulo samples using the extra 1-bit folding information is analyzed. Using the dithered quantization framework, we show that an oversampling factor of $\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and a quantizer resolution of $b > 3$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. When these conditions are met, we demonstrate that the mean squared error (MSE) performance of modulo ADC with an extra 1-bit folding information signal is better than that of a conventional ADC with the same number of bits used for amplitude quantization. Since folding information is typically not available in modulo ADCs, we also propose and analyze a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that does not require the 1-bit folding information. In this case, we prove that $\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and $b > 3 + \log_2(\delta)$ for some $\delta > 1$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. For the two systems considered, we show that, with sufficient number of bits for amplitude quantization, the mean squared error (MSE) of a modulo ADC is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}^3}\right)$ whereas that of a conventional ADC is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}}\right)$. We extend the analysis to the case of simultaneous acquisition of weak and strong signals occupying different frequency bands. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the derived performance guarantees.</p>

            <h2>Best Response Convergence for Zero-sum Stochastic Dynamic Games with Partial and Asymmetric Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxiang Guan, Iman Shames, Tyler H. Summers</p>
            <p>We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Wen, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, William Freeman, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An</p>
            <p>We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work that studies retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yali Zhang, Haifan Yin, Weidong Li, Emil Bjornson, Merouane Debbah</p>
            <p>The objective of this study is to address the mobility challenges faced by user equipment (UE) through the implementation of fluid antenna (FA) on the UE side. This approach aims to maintain the time-varying channel in a relatively stable state by strategically relocating the FA to an appropriate port. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of large language models (LLMs) in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. Our proposed method for predicting the moving port of the FA is a two-step prediction method. To enhance the learning efficacy of our proposed Port-LLM model, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Additionally, to further exploit the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, we propose a framework named Prompt-Port-LLM, which is constructed upon the Port-LLM architecture and incorporates prompt fine-tuning techniques along with a specialized prompt encoder module. The simulation results show that our proposed models all exhibit strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium-to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing methods, the performance of the port predicted by our models demonstrates superior efficacy. Moreover, both of our proposed models achieve millimeter-level inference speed.</p>

            <p>The prevalence of hearing aids is increasing. However, optimizing the amplification processes of hearing aids remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modular components in traditional methods. To address this challenge, we present NeuroAMP, a novel deep neural network designed for end-to-end, personalized amplification in hearing aids. NeuroAMP leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI) on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ). Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results highlight the potential of NeuroAMP and Denoising NeuroAMP to deliver notable improvements in personalized hearing aid amplification.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Synthetic-to-Real Gaps: Frequency-Aware Perturbation and Selection for Single-shot Multi-Parametric Mapping Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linyu Fan, Che Wang, Ming Ye, Qizhi Yang, Zejun Wu, Xinghao Ding, Yue Huang, Jianfeng Bao, Shuhui Cai, Congbo Cai</p>
            <p>Data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably advanced medical imaging, with emerging methods using synthetic data to address data scarcity while introducing synthetic-to-real gaps. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) shows promise in ground truth-scarce tasks, but its application in reconstruction remains underexplored. Although multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) achieves ultra-fast multi-parametric reconstruction, extending its application to various clinical scenarios, the quality suffers from deficiency in mitigating the domain gap, difficulty in maintaining structural integrity, and inadequacy in ensuring mapping accuracy. To resolve these issues, we proposed frequency-aware perturbation and selection (FPS), comprising Wasserstein distance-modulated frequency-aware perturbation (WDFP) and hierarchical frequency-aware selection network (HFSNet), which integrates frequency-aware adaptive selection (FAS), compact FAS (cFAS) and feature-aware architecture integration (FAI). Specifically, perturbation activates domain-invariant feature learning within uncertainty, while selection refines optimal solutions within perturbation, establishing a robust and closed-loop learning pathway. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, along with diverse real clinical cases from 5 healthy volunteers, 94 ischemic stroke patients, and 46 meningioma patients, demonstrate the superiority and clinical applicability of FPS. Furthermore, FPS is applied to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), underscoring its versatility and potential for broader medical applications. The code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Brain nuclei are clusters of anatomically distinct neurons that serve as important hubs for processing and relaying information in various neural circuits. Fine-scale parcellation of the brain nuclei is vital for a comprehensive understanding of its anatomico-functional correlations. Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that can estimate the brain's white matter structural connectivity to potentially reveal the topography of the nuclei of interest for studying its subdivisions. In this work, we present a deep clustering pipeline, namely DeepNuParc, to perform automated, fine-scale parcellation of brain nuclei using diffusion MRI tractography. First, we incorporate a newly proposed deep learning approach to enable accurate segmentation of the nuclei of interest directly on the dMRI data. Next, we design a novel streamline clustering-based structural connectivity feature for a robust representation of voxels within the nuclei. Finally, we improve the popular joint dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering approach to enable nuclei parcellation at a finer scale. We demonstrate DeepNuParc on two important brain structures, i.e. the amygdala and the thalamus, that are known to have multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei subdivisions. Experimental results show that DeepNuParc enables consistent parcellation of the nuclei into multiple parcels across multiple subjects and achieves good correspondence with the widely used coarse-scale atlases.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abolfazl Zakeri, Mohammad Moltafet, Marian Codreanu</p>
            <p>We address the real-time remote tracking problem in a status update system comprising two sensors, two independent information sources, and a remote monitor. The status updating follows a pull-based communication, where the monitor commands/pulls the sensors for status updates, i.e., the actual state of the sources. We consider that the observations are \textit{correlated}, meaning that each sensor's sent data could also include the state of the other source due to, e.g., inter-sensor communications or overlapping monitoring regions. The effectiveness of data communication is measured by a generic distortion, capturing the underlying application goal. We provide optimal command/pulling policies for the monitor that minimize the average weighted sum distortion and transmission cost. Since the monitor cannot fully observe the exact state of each source, we propose a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and reformulate it as a belief MDP problem. We then effectively truncate the infinite belief space and transform it into a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved via relative value iteration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policy over age-based and deep-Q network baseline policies.</p>

            <p>The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model weights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen rank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates by modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit variable performance across datasets. We propose SALT (Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation), a method that selectively adapts the most influential singular values using trainable scale and shift parameters while complementing this with a low-rank update for the remaining subspace. This hybrid approach harnesses the advantages of both LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on 5 challenging medical datasets, ranging from as few as 20 samples to 1000, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT (LoRA and SVD) by 2% to 5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters, demonstrating robust adaptation even in low-resource settings.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel G. P. Petrini, Hae Yong Kim</p>
            <p>Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation.

            <p>Counterfactual medical image generation enables clinicians to explore clinical hypotheses, such as predicting disease progression, facilitating their decision-making. While existing methods can generate visually plausible images from disease progression prompts, they produce silent predictions that lack interpretation to verify how the generation reflects the hypothesized progression -- a critical gap for medical applications that require traceable reasoning. In this paper, we propose Interpretable Counterfactual Generation (ICG), a novel task requiring the joint generation of counterfactual images that reflect the clinical hypothesis and interpretation texts that outline the visual changes induced by the hypothesis. To enable ICG, we present ICG-CXR, the first dataset pairing longitudinal medical images with hypothetical progression prompts and textual interpretations. We further introduce ProgEmu, an autoregressive model that unifies the generation of counterfactual images and textual interpretations. We demonstrate the superiority of ProgEmu in generating progression-aligned counterfactuals and interpretations, showing significant potential in enhancing clinical decision support and medical education.

            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized excitable system in which spikes can happen in a continuum of directions, therefore drastically enriching the expressivity and control capability of the spiking dynamics. In this generalized excitable system, spiking trajectories happen in a Hilbert space with an excitable resting state at the origin and spike responses that can be triggered in any direction as a function of the system's state and inputs. State-dependence of the spiking direction provide the system with a vanishing spiking memory trace, which enables robust tracking and integration of inputs in the spiking direction history. The model exhibits generalized forms of both Hodgkin's Type I and Type II excitability, capturing their usual bifurcation behaviors in an abstract setting. When used as the controller of a two-dimensional navigation task, this model facilitates both the sparseness of the actuation and its sensitivity to environmental inputs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed generalized excitable model for excitable control in high- and infinite-dimensional spaces.</p>

The approach refines the parameter estimates online using set-membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to a robust adaptive MPC scheme without iterative learning of the terminal ingredients.</p>

The model accounts for the cumulative effects of cascaded optical filters, amplifier-induced ASE noise, and transceiver noise, alongside digital equalization at the receiver.

These models capture the impact of colored noise resulting from linear filtering and provide both time and frequency-domain insights. The proposed framework is validated through experimental comparisons using accurately modeled optical filters, demonstrating close agreement between theory and practice and offering a robust foundation for system-level performance evaluation in metro-access networks.</p>

            <h2>Simultaneously Exposing and Jamming Covert Communications via Disco Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Huang, Hongliang Zhang, Yi Cai, Dusit Niyato, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Zhu Han</p>
            <p>Covert communications provide a stronger privacy protection than cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS). However, previous works on covert communications have implicitly assumed the validity of channel reciprocity, i.e., wireless channels remain constant or approximately constant during their coherence time. In this work, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco RIS (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, where the DRIS with random and time-varying reflective coefficients acts as a "disco ball", introducing timevarying fully-passive jamming (FPJ). Consequently, the channel reciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities of Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional jamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we first design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of time-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error probabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the signal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob. Based on the detection rule, we derive the detection threshold for the warden Willie to detect whether communications between Alice and Bob is ongoing, considering the time-varying DRIS-based FPJ. Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses of the FAR and the MDR at the warden Willie, as well as SJNR at Bob, and then present unique properties of the DRIS-based FPJ in covert communications. We present numerical results to validate the derived theoretical analyses and evaluate the impact of DRIS on covert communications.</p>

            <h2>FreqSelect: Frequency-Aware fMRI-to-Image Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junliang Ye, Lei Wang, Md Zakir Hossain</p>
            <p>Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.</p>

            <h2>Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiting Chen, Francesco Bullo, Emiliano Dall'Anese</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T>0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem. We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T < T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Hertneck, David Meister, Frank Allgöwer</p>
            <p>The defining characteristic of event-based control is that feedback loops are only closed when indicated by a triggering condition that takes recent information about the system into account. This stands in contrast to periodic control where the feedback loop is closed periodically. Benefits of event-based control arise when sampling comes at a cost, which occurs, e.g., for Networked Control Systems or in other setups with resource constraints. A rapidly growing number of publications deals with event-based control. Nevertheless, some fundamental questions about event-based control are still unsolved. In this article, we provide an overview of current research trends in event-based control. We focus on results that aim for a better understanding of effects that occur in feedback loops with event-based control. Based on this summary, we identify important open directions for future research.</p>

            <p>Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on >4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research.

            <h2>Speaker Targeting via Self-Speaker Adaptation for Multi-talker ASR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiqing Wang, Taejin Park, Ivan Medennikov, Jinhan Wang, Kunal Dhawan, He Huang, Nithin Rao Koluguri, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg</p>
            <p>We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe overlapping speech conditions.</p>

            <p>The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanqi Wang, Yang Liu, Peng Ye, Liang Song</p>
            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Jiang, Yuan Gao, Xinyi Wu, Shugong Xu</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.</p>

            <p>Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiny Choudhury, Michael Davidson, George Tynan</p>
            <p>Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping constraints. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to its fuel cycle and associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint for power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused from the transient buildup of neutron-absorbing xenon following a power reduction. This transient can delay or prevent subsequent power ramp-up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly, leading to prolonged downtimes. This work introduces a physics-informed modeling framework that embeds fuel cycle dynamics within a unit commitment (UC) formulation. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically enforces xenon induced constraints, and endogenously schedules refueling outages based on core conditions. By capturing intracycle reactivity evolution, the model enables operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both techno-economic requirements and irreducible nuclear physics limits. Application to a representative reactor fleet shows that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. Results further demonstrate that different operational modes substantially affect VRE utilization, curtailment, and nuclear fleet capacity factors. These findings highlight the importance of fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling for accurate reactor scheduling and integration of nuclear power into energy system models.</p>

            <h2>Learning local and global prototypes with optimal transport for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Trombetta, Carole Lartizien</p>
            <p>Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.</p>

            <p>Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in this https URL</p>

            <p>We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p>

            <p>Multimodal semantic communication has gained widespread attention due to its ability to enhance downstream task performance. A key challenge in such systems is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality. To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.</p>

            <p>For nonlinear multi-agent systems with high relative degrees, achieving formation control and obstacle avoidance in a distributed manner remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed safety-critical model predictive control (DSMPC) algorithm that incorporates discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHCBFs) to enforce safety constraints, alongside discrete-time control Lyapunov functions (DCLFs) to establish terminal constraints. To facilitate distributed implementation, we develop estimated neighbor states for formulating DHCBFs and DCLFs, while also devising a bound constraint to limit estimation errors and ensure convergence. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees regarding the feasibility and stability of the proposed DSMPC algorithm based on a mild assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by the simulation results, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computation time compared to existing approaches.</p>

            <p>The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.</p>

            <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangdi Hu, Keyi Liao, Jian Ye, Feng Guo</p>
            <p>Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.</p>

            <p>Speaker verification aims to verify whether an input speech corresponds to the claimed speaker, and conventionally, this kind of system is deployed based on single-stream scenario, wherein the feature extractor operates in full frequency range. In this paper, we hypothesize that machine can learn enough knowledge to do classification task when listening to partial frequency range instead of full frequency range, which is so called frequency selection technique, and further propose a novel framework of multi-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with this technique for speaker verification tasks. The proposed framework accommodates diverse temporal embeddings generated from multiple streams to enhance the robustness of acoustic modeling. For the diversity of temporal embeddings, we consider feature augmentation with frequency selection, which is to manually segment the full-band of frequency into several sub-bands, and the feature extractor of each stream can select which sub-bands to use as target frequency domain. Different from conventional single-stream solution wherein each utterance would only be processed for one time, in this framework, there are multiple streams processing it in parallel. The input utterance for each stream is pre-processed by a frequency selector within specified frequency range, and post-processed by mean normalization. The normalized temporal embeddings of each stream will flow into a pooling layer to generate fused embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on VoxCeleb dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that multi-stream CNN significantly outperforms single-stream baseline with 20.53 % of relative improvement in minimum Decision Cost Function (minDCF).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruk Gebregziabher, Hadush Hailu</p>
            <p>The safe and efficient operation of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) in complex environments, such as manufacturing, logistics, and agriculture, necessitates accurate multi-object tracking and predictive collision avoidance. This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors. This thesis contributes to the ongoing development of safe and efficient autonomous systems in complex and dynamic environments.</p>

            <h2>A Neural Speech Codec for Noise Robust Speech Coding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayi Huang, Zeyu Yan, Wenbin Jiang, He Wang, Fei Wen</p>
            <p>This paper considers the joint compression and enhancement problem for speech signal in the presence of noise. Recently, the SoundStream codec, which relies on end-to-end joint training of an encoder-decoder pair and a residual vector quantizer by a combination of adversarial and reconstruction losses,has shown very promising performance, especially in subjective perception quality. In this work, we provide a theoretical result to show that, to simultaneously achieve low distortion and high perception in the presence of noise, there exist an optimal two-stage optimization procedure for the joint compression and enhancement problem. This procedure firstly optimizes an encoder-decoder pair using only distortion loss and then fixes the encoder to optimize a perceptual decoder using perception loss. Based on this result, we construct a two-stage training framework for joint compression and enhancement of noisy speech signal. Unlike existing training methods which are heuristic, the proposed two-stage training method has a theoretical foundation. Finally, experimental results for various noise and bit-rate conditions are provided. The results demonstrate that a codec trained by the proposed framework can outperform SoundStream and other representative codecs in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

            <h2>A First-Order Gradient Approach for the Connectivity Optimization of Markov Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian P.C. Franssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bernd F. Heidergott</p>
            <p>Graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</p>

            <h2>Consensus in Multiagent Systems under communication failure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Bentaibi, Laura Caravenna, Jean-Paul A. Gauthier, Francesco Rossi</p>
            <p>We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure. We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Zhang, Tian-Hao Zhang, Jun Wang, Jiaran Gao, Xinyuan Qian, Xu-Cheng Yin</p>
            <p>Controlling the style and characteristics of speech synthesis is crucial for adapting the output to specific contexts and user requirements. Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

            <h2>MultiverSeg: Scalable Interactive Segmentation of Biomedical Imaging Datasets with In-Context Guidance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hallee E. Wong, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, John Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca</p>
            <p>Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of previously labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, MultiverSeg reduced the total number of clicks by 36% and scribble steps by 25% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks.

            <p>Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 98 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including normal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders of consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in sagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores of 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation including gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors and 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this task. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate and robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric this http URL: We are releasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in abnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs including labels for non-brain structures. Together the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.</p>

            <h2>Safety-Critical Human-Machine Shared Driving for Vehicle Collision Avoidance based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiyue Zhao, Junzhi Zhang, Rui Zhou, Neda Masoud, Jianxiong Li, Helai Huang, Shijie Zhao</p>
            <p>Road safety continues to be a pressing global issue, with vehicle collisions imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</p>

            <h2>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toru Lin, Kartik Sachdev, Linxi Fan, Jitendra Malik, Yuke Zhu</p>
            <p>Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tongxuan Tian, Haoyang Li, Bo Ai, Xiaodi Yuan, Zhiao Huang, Hao Su</p>
            <p>Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernd Zimmering, Cecília Coelho, Vaibhav Gupta, Maria Maleshkova, Oliver Niggemann</p>
            <p>Modelling forced dynamical systems - where an external input drives the system state - is critical across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In this work, we propose Laplace-Net, a decoupled, solver-free neural framework for learning forced and delay-aware systems. It leverages a Laplace transform-based approach to decompose internal dynamics, external inputs, and initial values into established theoretical concepts, enhancing interpretability. Laplace-Net promotes transferability since the system can be rapidly re-trained or fine-tuned for new forcing signals, providing flexibility in applications ranging from controller adaptation to long-horizon forecasting. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets - including linear, non-linear, and delayed systems - demonstrate the method's improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling complex and previously unseen inputs.</p>

            <h2>SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songqiao Hu, Zidong Wang, Zeyi Liu, Zhen Shen, Xiao He</p>
            <p>Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Furthermore, an incremental update theorem is established, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving an update speed significantly faster than comparison methods, while safely reaching the target position.

            <h2>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems (Extended Version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Furter, Yujun Huang, Gioele Zardini</p>
            <p>Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</p>

            <p>Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Da Col, Cristian R. Rojas, Vikram Krishnamurthy</p>
            <p>Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</p>

            <p>Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the full semantic and visual richness of video content remains challenging. We introduce TriPSS, a tri-modal framework that integrates perceptual features from the CIELAB color space, structural embeddings from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. These modalities are fused using principal component analysis to form compact multi-modal embeddings, enabling adaptive video segmentation via HDBSCAN clustering. A refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically diverse. Evaluations on the TVSum20 and SumMe benchmarks show that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. These results highlight TriPSS' ability to capture complementary visual and semantic cues, establishing it as an effective solution for video summarization, retrieval, and large-scale multimedia understanding.</p>
