            <h2>minPIC: Towards Optimal Power Allocation in Multi-User Interference Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sagnik Bhattacharya, Abhiram Rao Gorle, John M. Cioffi</p>
            <p>6G envisions massive cell-free networks with spatially nested multiple access (MAC) and broadcast (BC) channels without centralized coordination. This makes optimal resource allocation across power, subcarriers, and decoding orders crucial for interference channels (ICs), where neither transmitters nor receivers can cooperate. Current orthogonal multiple access (OMA) methods, as well as non-orthogonal (NOMA) and rate-splitting (RSMA) schemes, rely on fixed heuristics for interference management, leading to suboptimal rates, power inefficiency, and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel minPIC framework for optimal power, subcarrier, and decoding order allocation in general multi-user ICs. Unlike existing methods, minPIC eliminates heuristic SIC order assumptions. Despite the convexity of the IC capacity region, fixing an SIC order induces non-convexity in resource allocation, traditionally requiring heuristic approximations. We instead introduce a dual-variable-guided sorting criterion to identify globally optimal SIC orders, followed by convex optimization with auxiliary log-det constraints, efficiently solved via binary search. We also demonstrate that minPIC could potentially meet the stringent high-rate, low-power targets of immersive XR and other 6G applications. To the best of our knowledge, minPIC is the first algorithmic realisation of the Pareto boundary of the SIC-achievable rate region for Gaussian ICs, opening the door to scalable interference management in cell-free networks.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decision-Making Strategy Considering User Satisfaction Feedback in Demand Response Program</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Li, Li Ding, Qiao Lin, Zhen-Wei Yu</p>
            <p>Demand response providers (DRPs) are intermediaries between the upper-level distribution system operator and the lower-level participants in demand response (DR) programs. Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</p>

            <h2>On the Smart Coordination of Flexibility Scheduling in Multi-carrier Integrated Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Doh Dinga, Sander van Rijn, Laurens de Vries, Milos Cvetkovic</p>
            <p>Coordinating the interactions between flexibility assets in multi-carrier integrated energy systems (MIES) can lead to an efficient integration of variable renewable energy resources, and a cost-efficient energy transition. However, the proliferation of flexibility assets and their participation in active demand response increases the complexity of coordinating these interactions. This paper introduces different approaches to model the coordination of flexibility scheduling in MIES. We propose a market auction-inspired model coupling approach to address the challenges of preserving the autonomy and privacy of flexibility providers, and the issue of scalability. We benchmark our approach against co-optimization and an iterative price-response method by conducting experiments with varying problem sizes and computing infrastructure. We show that our approach scales well and is suitable for modeling flexibility in large-scale energy systems in a more realistic way. From an optimality standpoint, the flexibility dispatch schedules and electricity prices are ``near-optimal". Our methodology is implemented as a new open-source software, which offers several practical applications. For example, flexibility providers and network operators can couple their models to simulate the interaction between their systems without disclosing confidential information; policy regulators can use it to investigate new market design and regulations to optimize the utilization of flexibility in MIES.</p>

            <h2>Coordinating Distributed Energy Resources with Nodal Pricing in Distribution Networks: a Game-Theoretic Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eli Brock, Jingqi Li, Javad Lavaei, Somayeh Sojoudi</p>
            <p>We propose a real-time nodal pricing mechanism for cost minimization and voltage control in a distribution network with autonomous distributed energy resources and analyze the resulting market using stochastic game theory. Unlike existing methods, the proposed pricing scheme does not require device-aware centralized coordination or communication between prosumers. By developing new sufficient conditions under which a stochastic game is a Markov potential game, we show that the problem of computing an equilibrium for the proposed model is equivalent to solving a single-agent Markov Decision Process. These new conditions are general and may apply to other applications. We compute the equilibrium for an IEEE test system to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the pricing policy.</p>

            <h2>Transformer-Based Power Optimization for Max-Min Fairness in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irched Chafaa, Giacomo Bacci, Luca Sanguinetti</p>
            <p>Power allocation is an important task in wireless communication networks. Classical optimization algorithms and deep learning methods, while effective in small and static scenarios, become either computationally demanding or unsuitable for large and dynamic networks with varying user loads. This letter explores the potential of transformer-based deep learning models to address these challenges. We propose a transformer neural network to jointly predict optimal uplink and downlink power using only user and access point positions. The max-min fairness problem in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output systems is considered. Numerical results show that the trained model provides near-optimal performance and adapts to varying numbers of users and access points without retraining, additional processing, or updating its neural network architecture. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving robust and flexible power allocation for dynamic networks.</p>

            <h2>Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Md Obaidur Rahman, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Our paper is focused on optimal and control of an isolated photovoltaic system with batteries. The control is made by the application of a power management control (PMC). Batteries are kept safe from deep discharges and overloads by the PMC, maintaining a continuous supply to the load. The ease, with which this method can be implemented, as well as its effectiveness without imposing a large computing strain on the user, is noteworthy. The batteries and PV panels in the system under study are connected to a bidirectional converter enabling the batteries to be charged and drained in accordance with weather conditions. The simulation results, clearly highlight good performance of the proposed control across two different profiles.</p>

            <h2>Optimized Renewable Energy Planning MDP for Socially-Equitable Electricity Coverage in the US</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riya Kinnarkar, Mansur Arief</p>
            <p>Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Techno-economic Assessment of Wind-Powered Green Hydrogen Pathways</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merlinda Andoni, Benoit Couraud, Valentin Robu, Jamie Blanche, Sonam Norbu, Si Chen, Satria Putra Kanugrahan, David Flynn</p>
            <p>Amid global interest in resilient energy systems, green hydrogen is considered vital to the net-zero transition, yet its deployment remains limited by high production cost. The cost is determined by the its production pathway, system configuration, asset location, and interplay with electricity markets and regulatory frameworks. To compare different deployment strategies in the UK, we develop a comprehensive techno-economic framework based on the Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) assessment. We apply this framework to 5 configurations of wind-electrolyser systems, identify the most cost-effective business cases, and conduct a sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters. Our results reveal that electricity cost is the dominant contributor to LCOH, followed by the electrolyser cost. Our work highlights the crucial role that location, market arrangements and control strategies among RES and hydrogen investors play in the economic feasibility of deploying green hydrogen systems. Policies that subsidise low-cost electricity access and optimise deployment can lower LCOH, enhancing the economic competitiveness of green hydrogen.</p>

            <h2>Two-Stage Mechanism Design for Electric Vehicle Charging with Day-Ahead Reservations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan-Yang Su, Yi Ju, Scott Moura, Shankar Sastry</p>
            <p>We propose a general two-period model where electrical vehicles (EVs) can reserve charging sessions in the day-ahead market and swap them in the real-time market. Under the model, we explore several candidate mechanisms for running the two markets, compared using several normative properties such as incentive compatibility, efficiency, reservation awareness, and budget balance. Specifically, reservation awareness is the only property coupling the two markets and dictates that an EV will not get a lower utility by joining the real-time market. Focusing on the real-time market, we show that two variants of the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism do not satisfy all the proposed properties; specifically, one is not reservation-aware, while the other is not budget-balanced. Moreover, we show that no mechanism satisfies some combinations of the properties. Then, we propose to use a posted-price mechanism to resolve the issue, which turns out to be the dynamic pricing mechanism adopted in many real-world systems. The proposed mechanism has no efficiency guarantee but satisfies all the other properties. To improve efficiency, we propose to use a VCG auction in the day-ahead market that guides the reserve prices in the real-time market. When EVs' valuations in the two markets are highly correlated, the proposed approach results in highly efficient outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thinh Viet Le, Mark M. Wilde, Vassilis Kekatos</p>
            <p>The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Decoupled LVRT Control Strategy for Transient Voltage Stability Enhancement of IBRs Using Voltage-Angle Coupling Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangyuan Sun, Ruisheng Diao, Ruiyuan Zeng, Jing Zhang, Jianguo Qian</p>
            <p>With the fast-increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs), the voltage support capability of the grid following (GFL) IBRs under low voltage ride through (LVRT) control significantly influences the transient voltage stability of the power system. The existing LVRT adjusts the q-axis current to regulate reactive power injection. However, under a large disturbance, the phase-locked loop (PLL) error invalidates the proportional relationship between the q-axis current and reactive power, consequently causing deviation in the actual reactive power injection of the IBR. Besides, the variation of IBR current, determined by the PLL phase and LVRT, also directly influences the transient voltage. To address this issue, the specific influence of PLL error on active and reactive power injection is first analyzed under LVRT control. In addition, by combining the LVRT and PLL dynamics, the mechanisms of three voltage problems caused by voltage angle coupling are revealed. overvoltage, low voltage, and DC-side overvoltage. The specific scenarios in which these voltage stability problems occur are also obtained by the voltage-vector-triangle graphic. Furthermore, a power angle decoupled LVRT control is proposed to eliminate the influence of voltage angle coupling. Finally, the mechanism analysis and effectiveness of the decoupled LVRT are verified in the case study.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Approach to Evaluate Frequency Control Strength of Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taulant Kerci, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the concept of "frequency control strength" as a novel approach to understand how different real-world power systems compare to each other in terms of effectiveness and performance of system-wide frequency control. It presents a comprehensive comparison, based on measurement data, of the frequency control strength of four real-world, renewable-based, synchronous islands power systems, namely Great Britain (GB), All-Island power system (AIPS) of Ireland, and Australia (AUS) mainland and Tasmania (TAS). The strength is evaluated by means of different frequency quality metrics. The common understanding is that the bigger the capacity of a power system, the bigger its robustness with respect to events and contingencies. Here we show that this is not always the case in the context of frequency control. In fact, our study shows that mainland AUS shows the highest frequency control strength during normal operating conditions, whereas the AIPS shows the highest relative frequency control strength for abnormal system conditions. The strength is, in particular, greatly influenced by different regulatory requirements and different system/ancillary services arrangements in each jurisdiction. The paper also provides possible mitigations to improve frequency control strength through grid codes and market rules.</p>

            <h2>Grid congestion stymies climate benefit from U.S. vehicle electrification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter</p>
            <p>Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.</p>

            <h2>A Novel Tunable Controller for Grid Forming Converters towards Critical Services Application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangyadatta Tripathy, Barjeev Tyagi</p>
            <p>This paper demonstrates the key features of a control system applicable to inverter-based resources (IBR), which is based on grid-forming technology. Such resources are classified as grid-forming or grid-following converters based on the type of output with or without grid connection. With rapid growth in the energy sector to adopt carbon-free generation, Grid Forming Converter (GFC) seems suitable for power provision to remote or islanded operation of converters. A fully-fledged bulk power grid based on GFC requires complex control implementation with suitable tuning of its parameters. In this article a broader analysis of synchronous machine and such type of converter is discussed and designed in the MATLAB 2024 environment with its control technique is studied for a closed-loop system under contingencies. A proposed control scheme is developed to understand the frequency minimization problem and the minimization problem is solved using GAMS programming tool. The primary objective function is found to be suitable for minimization of frequency deviation using a mixed control approach. An artificial neural network-based controller is also proposed with Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm which augments the research by finding suitable optimal reference for GFM converter in the presence of a grid. A long-short-term memory (LSTM) based network is also proposed for the above control and the performance is found to be efficacious.</p>

            <h2>A Mathematical Model of Hybrid Microgrid With Pole Placement Controller Using State Feedback For Stability Improvement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yangyadatta Tripathy, Barjeev Tyagi</p>
            <p>This paper presents the development of a mathematical model of a converter state space model for a hybrid microgrid. The hybrid model combines the models of components such as DC-Converters, DC-AC converters, and their individual controllers, as well as loads. The input to the converter is considered a constant DC voltage, assumed to originate from distributed generations like solar, battery storage, or fuel-cells. The converter output is connected to a DC line through an LCL filter. The controller circuitry is designed to regulate the voltage, current, and power from the converter. Sensors are strategically placed to measure the currents, voltages, and power, and calculate the reference pulse signal using PWM for the switch. Similarly, the DC-AC converter is modeled. In the state space domain the converter models is used to design overall microgrid system. A single DC converter has six states and two inputs, with all states as outputs. A single DC-AC converter has thirteen states and three inputs, with all states as outputs. Three such converters of each type are considered to develop the DC microgrid and AC microgrid, which are then combined using mathematical analysis to model a hybrid microgrid. For the hybrid microgrid development, network and load models were also included. Eigenvalue analysis has been conducted to study the small signal stability of the considered system. The complete state space model of the hybrid microgrid has been programmed, and a pole-placement controller has been designed to enhance the stability of the system.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a cascade control structure to address the trajectory tracking problem for quadcopters, ensuring uniform global asymptotic stability of the state tracking error dynamics. An MPC strategy based on a 12-dimensional prediction model is proposed for the outer loop, explicitly accounting for time-varying coupled constraints, where multiple variables are interdependent and need to be handled together. The outer-loop controller generates an acceleration reference, which is then converted into attitude and angular velocity references, later tracked by a nonlinear inner-loop controller. Numerical simulations validate the approach, demonstrating enhanced performance in precise and fast tracking by imposing less conservative constraints than existing approaches, while still guaranteeing stability.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider the notion of resilience of a dynamical system, defined by the maximum disturbance a controlled dynamical system can withstand while satisfying given temporal logic specifications. Given a dynamical system and a specification, the objective is to synthesize the controller such that the closed-loop system satisfies this specification while maximizing its resilience. The problem is formulated as a robust optimization program where the objective is to compute the maximum resilience while simultaneously synthesizing the corresponding controller parameters. For linear systems and linear controllers, exact solutions are provided for the class of time-varying polytopic specifications. For the case of nonlinear systems, nonlinear controllers and more general specifications, we leverage tools from the scenario optimization approach, offering a probabilistic guarantee of the solution as well as computational feasibility. Different case studies are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.</p>

            <p>Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Reverse Path-Planning and Path-Tracking Control of a Vehicle with Trailer System</h2>

            <p>Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper. Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Computation of Feasible Assume-Guarantee Contracts: A Resilience-based Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Negar Monir, Youssef Ait Si, Ratnangshu Das, Pushpak Jagtap, Adnane Saoud, Sadegh Soudjani</p>
            <p>We propose a resilience-based framework for computing feasible assume-guarantee contracts that ensure the satisfaction of temporal specifications in interconnected discrete-time systems. Interconnection effects are modeled as structured disturbances. We use a resilience metric, the maximum disturbance under which local specifications hold, to refine assumptions and guarantees across subsystems iteratively. For two subsystems, we demonstrate correctness, monotone refinement of guarantees, and that the resulting assumptions are maximal within ball-shaped sets. Additionally, we extend our approach to general networks of L subsystems using weighted combinations of interconnection effects. We instantiate the framework on linear systems by meeting finite-horizon safety, exact-time reachability, and finite-time reachability specifications, and on nonlinear systems by fulfilling general finite-horizon specifications. Our approach is demonstrated through numerical linear examples, and a nonlinear DC Microgrid case study, showcasing the impact of our framework in verifying temporal logic specifications with compositional reasoning.</p>

            <h2>Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihao Lin, Shuo Liu, Zhen Tian, Dezong Zhao, Jianglin Lan</p>
            <p>Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Paths for Adaptive Fly-Scan Microscopy: An Extended Version</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Lu, Thomas F. Lynn, Ming Du, Zichao Di, Sven Leyffer</p>
            <p>In x-ray microscopy, traditional raster-scanning techniques are used to acquire a microscopic image in a series of step-scans. Alternatively, scanning the x-ray probe along a continuous path, called a fly-scan, reduces scan time and increases scan efficiency. However, not all regions of an image are equally important. Currently used fly-scan methods do not adapt to the characteristics of the sample during the scan, often wasting time in uniform, uninteresting regions. One approach to avoid unnecessary scanning in uniform regions for raster step-scans is to use deep learning techniques to select a shorter optimal scan path instead of a traditional raster scan path, followed by reconstructing the entire image from the partially scanned data. However, this approach heavily depends on the quality of the initial sampling, requires a large dataset for training, and incurs high computational costs. We propose leveraging the fly-scan method along an optimal scanning path, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) and using image completion techniques to reconstruct details in non-scanned areas. This approach further shortens the scanning process and potentially decreases x-ray exposure dose while maintaining high-quality and detailed information in critical regions. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-iteration fly-scan framework that adapts to the scanned image. Specifically, in each iteration, we define two key functions: (1) a score function to generate initial anchor points and identify potential ROIs, and (2) an objective function to optimize the anchor points for convergence to an optimal set. Using these anchor points, we compute the shortest scanning path between optimized anchor points, perform the fly-scan, and subsequently apply image completion based on the acquired information in preparation for the next scan iteration.</p>

            <h2>RadioDiff-Loc: Diffusion Model Enhanced Scattering Congnition for NLoS Localization with Sparse Radio Map Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiucheng Wang, Qiming Zhang, Nan Cheng</p>
            <p>Accurate localization of non-cooperative signal sources in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge with a wide range of applications, including autonomous navigation, industrial automation, and emergency response. In such settings, traditional positioning techniques relying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe multipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel generative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional diffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted electromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling strategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at the geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information and mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack of known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to the maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant radio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the full RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization is then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM. Moreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based localization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical knowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that our approach achieves high localization accuracy with significantly reduced sampling cost, offering a scalable and physically grounded solution for non-cooperative NLoS emitter localization.</p>

            <h2>From Evaluation to Optimization: Neural Speech Assessment for Downstream Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Tsao</p>
            <p>The evaluation of synthetic and processed speech has long been a cornerstone of audio engineering and speech science. Although subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for assessing perceptual quality and intelligibility, their high cost, time requirements, and limited scalability present significant challenges in the rapid development cycles of modern speech technologies. Traditional objective metrics, while computationally efficient, often exhibit weak correlation with human perception, creating a perceptual gap between system optimization and actual user experience. Bridging this gap requires speech assessment models that are more closely aligned with human perception. In recent years, numerous neural network-based speech assessment models have been developed to predict quality and intelligibility, achieving promising results. Beyond their role in evaluation, these models are increasingly integrated into downstream speech processing tasks. This review focuses on their role in two main areas: (1) serving as differentiable perceptual proxies that not only assess but also guide the optimization of speech enhancement and synthesis models; and (2) enabling the detection of salient speech characteristics to support more precise and efficient downstream processing. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline future research directions to further advance the integration of speech assessment into speech processing pipelines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehan Li, Yan Yang, Xueqing Li, Jian Kang, Xiao-Lei Zhang, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Pre-trained models, especially self-supervised learning (SSL) models, have demonstrated impressive results in automatic speech recognition (ASR) task. While most applications of SSL models focus on leveraging continuous representations as features for training downstream tasks, the utilization of discrete units has gained increasing attention in recent years owing to its lower storage requirements and broader range of applications. In multilingual ASR tasks, representations at different layers of the model contribute differently to various languages, complicating the unification of discrete unit modeling. In this paper, we propose a two-stage training strategy to improve the discrete token performance of pre-trained models and narrow the gap with continuous representation performance. We validate our method on the XLS-R model following the settings of Interspeech2024 Speech Processing Using Discrete Speech Unit Challenge. Our method demonstrates a significant improvement on the ML-SUPERB dataset, achieving a 44% relative reduction on CER for the XLS-R model. This surpasses the previous baseline set by the WavLM model, which achieves a 26% relative reduction on CER. Furthermore, our method achieves the first place among all the single-system results on the leaderboard.</p>

            <p>Accurate and timely water level monitoring is critical for flood prevention, environmental management, and emerging smart infrastructure systems. Traditional water sensing methods often rely on dedicated sensors, which can be costly to deploy and difficult to maintain and are vulnerable to damage during this http URL this work, we propose a novel cellular signalbased sensing scheme that passively estimates water level changes using downlink mobile signals from existing communication infrastructure. By capturing subtle variations in channel state information (CSI), the proposed method estimates the length changes of the water-reflected signal path, which correspond to water level variations. A space-time processing framework is developed to jointly estimate the angle of arrival and Doppler shift, enabling isolation and enhancement of the water-reflected path via beamforming, while effectively suppressing environmental noise. The phase evolution of the beamformed signal is then extracted to infer water level changes. To address clock asynchronism between the transmitter and receiver inherent in bistatic systems, we introduce a beamforming-based compensation technique for removing time-varying random phase offsets in CSI. Field experiments conducted across a river demonstrate that the proposed method enables accurate and reliable water level estimation, achieving a mean accuracy ranging from 1.5 cm to 3.05 cm across different receiver configurations and deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md. Mohibbul Haque Chowdhury, Nafisa Anjum, Md. Rokonuzzaman Mim</p>
            <p>Stress has emerged as a critical global health issue, contributing to cardiovascular disorders, depression, and several other long-term illnesses. Consequently, accurate and reliable stress monitoring systems are of growing importance. In this work, we propose a stress prediction framework based on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded during multiple daily activities such as sitting, walking, and jogging. Frequency-domain indicators of autonomic nervous system activity were obtained through Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis and utilized as input for machine learning models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were directly applied to the raw ECG signals. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of ensemble-based classifiers, with CatBoost achieving 90% accuracy. Moreover, the LSTM model provided superior results, attaining 94% accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score, reflecting its strength in modeling temporal dependencies in ECG data. Overall, the findings suggest that integrating frequency-domain feature extraction with advanced learning algorithms enhances stress prediction and paves the way for real-time healthcare monitoring solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rina Kotani, Chiaki Miyazaki, Shiro Suzuki</p>
            <p>We aim to develop a technology that makes the sound from earphones and headphones easier to hear without increasing the sound pressure or eliminating ambient noise. To this end, we focus on harnessing the phenomenon of binaural unmasking through phase reversal in one ear. Specifically, we conduct experiments to evaluate the improvement of audibility caused by the phenomenon, using conditions that approximate practical scenarios. We use speech sounds by various speakers, including women, and noises that can be encountered in daily life (urban environmental sounds, cheers) to verify the effects of binaural unmasking under conditions close to practical situations. The results of experiments using the Japanese language showed that (i) speech in a noisy environment is perceived to be up to about 6 dB louder with phase reversal in one ear, and (ii) a certain effect (improvement of audibility by 5 dB or more) is obtained for all speakers and noises targeted in this study. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of binaural unmasking attributed to interaural phase differences in practical scenarios.</p>

            <h2>On Performance of IoT Networks with Coordinated NOMA Transmission: Covert Monitoring and Information Decoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thai-Hoc Vu, Anh-Tu Le, Ngo Hoang Tu, Tan N. Nguyen, Miroslav Voznak</p>
            <p>This work investigates the covertness and security performance of Internet-of-Things (IoTs) networks under Rayleigh fading environments. Specifically, a cellular source transmits covert information to cell-edge users with the assistance of an IoT master node, employing a coordinated direct and relay transmission strategy combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). This approach not only enhances spectrum utilization but also generates friendly interference to complicate a warden's surveillance or an eavesdropper's decoding efforts. From a covertness perspective, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) under arbitrary judgment thresholds. We then identify the optimal judgment threshold for the worst-case scenario, at which the warden minimizes its DEP performance. Accordingly, we determine the effective region for user power allocation (PA) in NOMA transmission that satisfies the DEP constraint. From a security perspective, we derive analytical expressions for the secrecy outage probability under two eavesdropping strategies using selection combining and maximal ratio combining. Based on this analysis, we propose an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes covert rate while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of legitimate users, the system's minimum covertness requirements, and supporting successive interference cancellation (SIC) procedures. Furthermore, we design an adaptive PA scheme that maximizes the secrecy rate while ensuring the QoS requirements of legitimate users and SIC conditions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of the analytical framework, while the proposed optimization strategies effectively adjust PA coefficients to maximize either the covert rate or the secrecy rate.</p>

            <p>Speech Recognition has seen a dramatic shift towards adopting Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is partly driven by good scalability properties demonstrated by LLMs, ability to leverage large amounts of labelled, unlabelled speech and text data, streaming capabilities with auto-regressive framework and multi-tasking with instruction following characteristics of LLMs. However, simple next-token prediction objective, typically employed with LLMs, have certain limitations in performance and challenges with hallucinations. In this paper, we propose application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable reinforcement learning from human feedback for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We design simple rule based reward functions to guide the policy updates. We demonstrate significant improvements in word error rate (upto 18.4% relative), reduction in hallucinations, increased robustness on out-of-domain datasets and effectiveness in domain adaptation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianhua Gao, Kohji Tomita, Akiya Kamimura</p>
            <p>This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>As the vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have become more widely recognized, the need for complementary navigation systems has grown. Medium frequency ranging mode (MF R-Mode) has gained attention as an effective backup system during GNSS outages, owing to its strong signal strength and cost-effective scalability. However, to achieve accurate positioning, MF R-Mode requires correction for the additional secondary factor (ASF), a propagation delay affected by terrain. The temporal variation of ASF, known as temporal ASF, is typically corrected using reference stations; however, the effectiveness of this method decreases with distance from the reference station. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between temporal ASF and meteorological factors to evaluate the feasibility of predicting temporal ASF based on meteorological factors. Among these factors, temperature and humidity showed significant correlations with temporal ASF, suggesting their potential utility in ASF correction.</p>

            <p>The synergy between integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) unlocks novel applications and advanced services for next-generation wireless networks, yet also introduces new security challenges. In this study, a novel dual target-mounted RISs-assisted ISAC scheme is proposed, where a base station with ISAC capability performs sensing of two unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets, one of which is legitimate and the other is eavesdropper, while communicating with the users through an RIS mounted on the legitimate UAV target. The proposed scheme addresses dual security threats posed by a hostile UAV target: eavesdropping on legitimate user communications and random interference attacks launched by a malicious RIS mounted on this eavesdropper UAV target, aiming to disrupt secure transmissions. A non-convex optimization problem maximizing the secrecy rate of the users is formulated, and a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based two-stage solution is developed to optimize the transmit beamforming matrix of the base station and the phase shift coefficients of the legitimate RIS. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution under various system configurations. The proposed system's communication performance is assessed using the secrecy rate metric, while the sensing performance is evaluated through the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation of the eavesdropper UAV target.</p>

            <p>To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while maintaining identical communication overhead.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shen Chen, Jisong Wang, Dejun Liu, Jiaxi Ying, Shuai Wang</p>
            <p>A popular method for designing digital models is transforming the transfer function of the corresponding analog models from continuous domain (s-domain) into discrete domain (z-domain) using the s-to-z transformation. The alpha-approximation is a generalized form of these transformations. When alpha is set to 0.5, the result is the well-known Tustin transformation or bi-linear transformation. In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the alpha-approximation method, including mathematical interpretation, stability analysis and distortion analysis. Through mathematical interpretation, we revealed that it can be derived by numerically integrating the error function We defined this as the hexagonal approximation. We demonstrated that the stable range of alpha was [0.5, 1] by doing stability analysis. Through distortion analysis, we found that minimizing amplitude and phase distortion simultaneously seemed impossible by regulating alpha alone. Finally, We proposed an exclusion hypothesis hypothesizing that there is no single parameter alpha to minimize the amplitude distortion and phase distortion simultaneously across all frequency points within the Nyquist frequency range. This paper demonstrates that designing parameter alpha involves balancing amplitude and phase distortion.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) at terahertz (THz) frequencies holds significant promise for unifying ultra-high-speed wireless connectivity with fine-grained environmental awareness. Realistic and interpretable channel modeling is essential to fully realize the potential of such systems. This work presents a comprehensive investigation of monostatic sensing channels at 300~GHz, based on an extensive measurement campaign conducted at 57 co-located transceiver (TRx) positions across three representative indoor scenarios. Multipath component (MPC) parameters, including amplitude, delay, and angle, are extracted using a high-resolution space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. To cluster the extracted MPCs, an image-processing-based clustering method, i.e., connected component labeling (CCL), is applied to group MPCs based on delay-angle consistency. Based on the measurement data, an environment-aware channel modeling framework is proposed to establish mappings between physical scenario attributes (e.g., reflector geometry, surface materials, and roughness) and their corresponding channel-domain manifestations. The framework incorporates both specular and diffuse reflections and leverages several channel parameters, e.g., reflection loss, Lambertian scattering, and intra-cluster dispersion models, to characterize reflection behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reliably extract physical characteristics, e.g., structural and material information, from the observed channel characteristics, offering a promising foundation for advanced THz ISAC channel modeling.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel approach to robust load disturbance rejection in DC-DC Buck converters. We propose a novel control scheme based on the design of two nested feedback loops. First, we design the controller in the outer loop using H infinity optimal control theory, and we show, by means of mu-analysis, that such a controller provides robust stability in the presence of uncertainty affecting the physical parameters of the circuit. Then, we introduce an inner feedback loop to improve the system's response to output load disturbances. As far as the inner loop is considered, we propose a novel load estimation-compensation (LEC) scheme, and we discuss under what conditions the insertion of such an inner loop preserves the robust stability of the entire control system. The LEC scheme is compared with the other two linear structures based on well-established disturbance rejection methods. The advantages of LEC in terms of both complexity of implementation and obtained performances are discussed and demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Finally, we present experimental results obtained through the implementation of the proposed control scheme on a prototype board to demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances disturbance rejection performances with respect to the approach commonly used in DC-DC buck converters.</p>

This paper introduces a new orthogonal multicarrier waveform, namely Affine-Doppler Division Multiplexing (ADDM), which can provide a generic framework and subsume the existing OTFS and AFDM as a particular case. ADDM modulating information symbols in the Affine-Doppler (A-D) domain based on a two-dimensional (2D) transform can enjoy both excellent unambiguous Doppler and Doppler resolution, which is the same as AFDM but outperforms OTFS. Moreover, benefiting from the 2D transform, the symbols block of ADDM in the A-D domain undergoes a 2D cyclic shift produced by the delay and the Doppler of the channel, similar to the 2D cyclic shift in the delay-Doppler domain of cyclic prefix (CP)-OTFS. This offers a potential to directly apply the state-of-the-art methods well-designed for OTFS and AFDM to ADDM. Numerical results show that ADDM achieves comparable BER performance with AFDM but outperforms OTFS in high-mobility scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Implementing General-Order Frequency Dynamic Response Model and Frequency Excursion Duration Criterion in Unit Commitment Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Rajabdorri, Bo Zhou, Lukas Sigrist, Enrique Lobato</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel approach for incorporating frequency dynamics into the unit commitment (UC) problem through a general-order differential equation model, solved using Bernstein polynomial approximation. Traditional frequency-constrained UC (FCUC) models typically rely on simplified first-order assumptions or scalar frequency metrics, such as frequency nadir, to indirectly enforce dynamic behavior. In contrast, our formulation explicitly models time-domain frequency response using second-order dynamics, enabling a more accurate and flexible representation of generator behavior. The resulting differential equations are approximated with high fidelity using Bernstein polynomials, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that remains computationally tractable for small-scale power systems. Additionally, we introduce a new constraint based on the duration of frequency excursions below a critical threshold, motivated by practical concerns such as relay operation and equipment protection. A data-driven method is employed to relate the area under this threshold-computed as the integral of the Bernstein approximation-to the duration of frequency deviation. The proposed framework is validated using real-world data from an island system in Spain, demonstrating enhanced frequency security with a moderate increase in operational cost. These results suggest the method's strong potential for application in low-inertia, small-scale power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salmane Naoumi, Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Marwa Chafii</p>
            <p>This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Robust Performance Analysis and Nonlinearity Shaping for Closed-loop Reset Control Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Ali Hosseini, Dragan Kostić, S. Hassan HosseinNia</p>
            <p>Reset elements are nonlinear filters that improve control performance beyond linear time-invariant (LTI) limits but introduce higher-order harmonics that complicate design. Although frequency-domain tools like describing functions (DFs) and higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions (HOSIDFs) analyze reset control systems (RCS), no direct method yet quantifies the impact of higher-order harmonics on the error signal without time-domain simulations. This paper introduces a robustness factor, $\sigma_2(\omega)$, which quantifies the increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the error signal due to HOSIDFs, enabling RCS to rely solely on first-order DF characteristics while accounting for nonlinear effects. By using this robustness factor, a systematic method for designing pre- and post-filters is developed to ensure a predefined bound on $\sigma_2(\omega)$, thereby limiting the influence of higher-order harmonics without altering first-order DF behavior. The proposed framework is validated through a case study on a planar precision positioning stage, demonstrating how the robustness factor guides the reduction of nonlinearities and improves performance predictability.</p>

            <p>In reactor-grade tokamaks, pellet injection is the best candidate for core plasma fuelling. However, density control schemes that can handle the hybrid nature of this type of fuelling, i.e., the discrete impact of the pellets on the continuously evolving plasma density, are lacking. This paper proposes a neuromorphic controller, inspired by the integrate-and-fire neuronal model, to address this problem. The overall system is modelled as a hybrid system, and we analyse the proposed controller in closed loop with a single-input single-output linear time-invariant plasma model. The controller generates spikes, representing pellet launches, when the neuron variable reaches a certain threshold. Between the control actions, or spikes, the system evolves in open loop. We establish conditions on the controller variables and minimum actuator speed, depending on the reference value for the desired density, the pellet size and the time-constant of the plasma density, that guarantee a practical stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are illustrated in a numerical example.</p>

            <p>Next-generation networks require intelligent and robust channel conditions to support ultra-high data rates, seamless connectivity, and large-scale device deployments in dynamic environments. While flexible antenna technologies such as fluid and movable antennas offer some degree of adaptability, their limited reconfiguration range and structural rigidity reduce their effectiveness in restoring line-of-sight (LoS) links. As a complementary solution, pinching antenna systems (PASs) enable fine-grained, hardware-free control of radiation locations along a waveguide, offering enhanced flexibility in challenging propagation environments, especially under non-LoS (NLoS) conditions. This paper introduces a general and novel modeling framework for downlink PASs targeting users equipped with multiple receive antennas, addressing a practical yet underexplored scenario in the existing literature. Specifically, we first derive an analytical relationship between the received signal-to-noise ratio and the pinching antenna (PA) positions, and based on this, we propose a two-layer placement strategy. First, we optimize the central radiation point using large-scale channel characteristics, and then we use a heuristic compressed placement algorithm to approximate phase alignment across multiple receive antennas and select a spatially compact set of active elements. Simulation results demonstrate notable performance gains over conventional single-antenna schemes, particularly in short-range scenarios with dense PAs and widely spaced user antennas.</p>

            <p>We investigate the task and motion planning problem for dynamical systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. Existing works on STL control synthesis mainly focus on generating plans that satisfy properties over a single executed trajectory. In this work, we consider the planning problem for hyperproperties evaluated over a set of possible trajectories, which naturally arise in information-flow control problems. Specifically, we study discrete-time dynamical systems and employ the recently developed temporal logic HyperSTL as the new objective for planning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel recursive counterexample-guided synthesis approach capable of effectively handling HyperSTL specifications with multiple alternating quantifiers. The proposed method is not only applicable to planning but also extends to HyperSTL model checking for discrete-time dynamical systems. Finally, we present case studies on security-preserving planning and ambiguity-free planning to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HyperSTL planning framework.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a data-driven Forward Selection with Neighborhood Refinement (FSNR) algorithm to determine the number and placement of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for maximizing deep-learning-based fault diagnosis performance. Candidate PMU locations are ranked via a cross-validated Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and each selection is refined through local neighborhood exploration to produce a near-optimal sensor set. The resulting PMU subset is then supplied to a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for faulted-line localization and fault-type classification from time-series measurements. Evaluation on modified IEEE 34- and IEEE 123-bus systems demonstrates that the proposed FSNR-SVM method identifies a minimal PMU configuration that achieves the best overall CNN performance, attaining over 96 percent accuracy in fault location and over 99 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 34 system, and approximately 94 percent accuracy in fault location and around 99.8 percent accuracy in fault-type classification on the IEEE 123 system.</p>

            <p>This paper deals with the finite-time stabilization of a class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems. First, we consider a bounded matched perturbation in its linear form. It is shown that by using a set-valued function, both the convergence objective (finite-time) and the rejection of perturbations are achieved. Second, we consider a class of nonlinear systems and design a feedback control that ensures the closed-loop system is finite-time stable. All proofs presented in this paper regarding convergence are based on Lyapunov theory. The existence of solutions to the closed-loop system and its well-posedness are established using maximal monotone theory. To illustrate the applicability of the theoretical results, a heat equation is considered as an application of the main results.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the analysis, design, fabrication, and measurement of an integrated low-noise amplifier (LNA) implemented using a 130 nm CMOS technology, operating in the 2.4 GHz band. The LNA is a crucial component in the performance of receivers, particularly in integrated receivers. The proposed LNA was designed to meet the specifications of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Post-layout simulation results, including pads with electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, are as follows: gain of 10.7 dB, noise figure of 2.7 dB, third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of 0.9 dBm, input and output impedance matching better than -20 dB with respect to 50~$\Omega$ terminations, with a power consumption of 505 $\mu$W powered from a 1.2 V supply. The obtained results fall within the range of those recently reported for the same topology and operating frequency. The measured scattering parameters (S-parameters) are consistent with the simulation results.

The system employs an indium-gallium-zinc-oxide electrolyte-gated FET (IGZO-EGFET) functionalized with glucose oxidase as a biocompatible receiver, a microfluidic channel with a syringe-pump transmitter using on-off keying (OOK), and a machine-intelligence pipeline that addresses model mismatch and hardware non-idealities. The pipeline integrates: (i) a modular universal decoder robust to vibration-induced noise, chemical delay, and single-tap intersymbol interference; (ii) a lightweight pilot-only synchronizer that estimates symbol intervals; and (iii) a virtual-response generator that augments data and scales symbol duration. Experiments across multiple chips and sessions demonstrate end-to-end chemical text transmission with consistent error-rate reductions compared to naive thresholding and standard neural baselines. By coupling biocompatible hardware with learning-based detection and generative augmentation, this work establishes a practical route toward AI-native nanomachine networks and higher rate molecular links, while providing a system blueprint adaptable to other biochemical modalities.</p>

            <p>On 21 June 2024, a severe incident happened in the South-Eastern part of the Continental European power system. After a voltage collapse, large parts of Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Croatia suffered from a blackout [1]. The initial tripping of two transmission lines resulted in a voltage collapse in these countries. Investigations have shown that a) transformers with on-load tap changers (OLTC) and b) nonlinear loads, in particular air conditioning systems, played a significant role in this event. Motivated by this, we carry out an assessment of the effect of OLTC on voltage stability in the presence of nonlinear loads. By doing this we hope to further shed some light on the potential instability mechanisms that can be triggered in scenarios like the above-mentioned blackout.</p>

            <p>Ensuring the stability of wireless networked control systems (WNCS) with nonlinear and control-non-affine dynamics, where system behavior is nonlinear with respect to both states and control decisions, poses a significant challenge, particularly under limited resources. However, it is essential in the context of 6G, which is expected to support reliable communication to enable real-time autonomous systems. This paper proposes a joint communication and control solution consisting of: i) a deep Koopman model capable of learning and mapping complex nonlinear dynamics into linear representations in an embedding space, predicting missing states, and planning control actions over a future time horizon; and ii) a scheduling algorithm that schedules sensor-controller communication based on Lyapunov optimization, which dynamically allocates communication resources based on system stability and available resources. Control actions are computed within this embedding space using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to ensure system stability. The proposed model is evaluated under varying conditions and its performance is compared against two baseline models; one that assumes systems are control-affine, and another that assumes identical control actions in the embedding and original spaces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms both baselines, by achieving stability while requiring fewer transmissions.</p>

            <p>As wireless networks evolve toward AI-integrated intelligence, conventional energy-efficiency metrics fail to capture the value of AI tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel EE metric called Token-Responsive Energy Efficiency (TREE), which incorporates the token throughput of large models as network utility carriers into the system utility. Based on this metric, we analyze the design principles of AI-integrated 6G networks from the perspective of three critical AI elements, namely computing power, model and data. Case studies validate TREE's unique capability to expose energy-service asymmetries in hybrid traffic scenarios where conventional metrics prove inadequate. Although it is impossible to determine every design detail of AI-integrated 6G network at current time, we believe that the proposed TREE based framework will help the network operators to quantify the operating energy cost of AI services and continue to evolve towards sustainable 6G networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Guo, Junshan Luo, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding, Shilian Wang, Zhenhai Xu</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the challenge of co-channel interference and intentional jamming in low-altitude air-ground communications. Since conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems lack spatial adaptability to dynamically balance signal enhancement against interference suppression, we propose a transformative fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted heterogeneous dual-layer transmission architecture. Specifically, a terrestrial base station with FPA serves ground users, while a low altitude-serving base station equipped with FAS communicates with the aerial user, also equipped with FAS, under the attack of a malicious jammer. We formulate a worst-case achievable rate maximization problem for aerial user subject to constraints including quality-of-service for terrestrial users, imperfect jamming directions, minimum antenna separation, etc. To address the non-convex problem, we propose a fractional programming-block coordinate descent algorithm that alternately optimizes the transmit precoders, receive combiner, and antenna positions at both transceiver sides. Convex hull-based approach and geometric boundary method are used to handle the jamming uncertainty and antenna placement constraints in confined spatial regions, respectively. Extensive simulations validate significant performance gains. The FAS achieves up to 56\% higher data rates than FPA under equivalent power constraints. Strategic antenna repositioning demonstrably enhances signal quality while suppressing interference, maintaining robustness across diverse jammer channel uncertainties.</p>

            <p>The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique has been considered a key enabler for 6G radio access networks. ISAC fulfills a brand new paradigm shift in wireless networks via the seamless interplay between communication and sensing within a unified network. However, the tight integration of these functionalities inevitably gives rise to various types of interference, posing significant challenges to existing ISAC waveform designs and rendering interference management a critical concern. Inspired by the development trajectory of wireless communications, different multiple access (MA) techniques, such as orthogonal multiple access (OMA), space-division multiple access (SDMA), and more recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in efficiently utilizing limited spectrum resources, designing ISAC waveforms, as well as managing inter-user interference and inter-functionality interference in ISAC. Notably, the interplay between MA and ISAC presents mutually beneficial integration. On the one hand, ISAC helps MA techniques better exploit their interference management capability beyond the communication-only networks. On the other hand, different MA techniques serve as promising solutions for inter-functionality and inter-user interference management in ISAC. In this paper, we deliver the first comprehensive tutorial of MA techniques in ISAC networks. Specifically, we illustrate the fundamental principles of ISAC, classify the diverse types of interference in different ISAC systems, and compare MA-assisted ISAC designs, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. Moreover, we provide an outlook on the emerging applications and future research directions of different MA-assisted ISAC.</p>

            <p>Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. We develop statistical models for EVs moving at constant speeds to identify the location and magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency is dependent on the ER coil spacing and the average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the number of EVs. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the number of EVs. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. We also show that for higher-order harmonics, the spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth. Despite the simplified models, our analysis offers valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Numerical tests using a traffic simulator corroborate some of these insights.</p>

            <p>In current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, roadside units (RSUs) broadcast brief warning messages that alert nearby vehicles to avoid potential hazards. However, these messages lack contextual information on why a warning is issued, leading to excessive caution or inefficient driving behaviors. To avoid such a situation, we propose a semantic-enhanced and explainable V2X (SEE-V2X) system. In the proposed system, RSUs equipped with smart cameras detect obstructions and transmit context-aware messages to vehicles. By understanding both what the hazard is and why it occurs, drivers can make more intelligent decisions based on their specific driving situation. Furthermore, through a real-field demonstration, we show the new "see-through" feature in the proposed system, which enables drivers to visualize hidden pedestrians behind obstacles. We also perform simulations to compare traditional V2X with SEE-V2X under different traffic conditions. The results show that SEE-V2X significantly improves traffic efficiency and reduces unnecessary deceleration.</p>

            <p>Hyperspectral (HS) images provide fine spectral resolution but have limited spatial resolution, whereas multispectral (MS) images capture finer spatial details but have fewer bands. HS-MS fusion aims to integrate HS and MS images to generate a single image with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This is commonly formulated as an inverse problem with a linear forward model. However, reconstructing high-quality images using the forward model alone is challenging, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. Over the years, numerous methods have been developed, including wavelets, total variation, low-rank models, and deep neural networks. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of denoiser-driven regularization, where a powerful off-the-shelf denoiser is used for implicit regularization within an iterative algorithm. This approach has shown promise but remains relatively underexplored in hyperspectral imaging. Our focus is on a crucial aspect of denoiser-driven algorithms: ensuring convergence of the iterations. It is known that powerful denoisers can produce high-quality reconstructions, but they are also prone to instability and can cause the iterations to diverge. The challenge is to design denoisers that come with a convergence guarantee. In this work, we propose a denoiser-driven fusion algorithm, HyDeFuse, which leverages a class of pseudo-linear denoisers for implicit regularization. We demonstrate how the contraction mapping theorem can be applied to establish global linear convergence of HyDeFuse. Additionally, we introduce enhancements to the denoiser that significantly improve the performance of HyDeFuse, making it competitive with state-of-the-art techniques. We validate our theoretical results and present fusion results on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the performance of HyDeFuse.</p>

            <p>The space-air-ground-sea integrated networking (SAGSIN) concept promises seamless global multimedia connectivity, yet two obstacles still limit its practical deployment. Firstly, high-velocity satellites, aerial relays and sea-surface platforms suffer from obsolete channel state information (CSI), undermining feedback-based adaptation. Secondly, data-rate disparity across the protocol stack is extreme: terabit optical links in space coexist with kilobit acoustic under-water links. This article shows that a single large language model (LLM) backbone, trained jointly on radio, optical and acoustic traces, can provide a unified, data-driven adaptation layer that addresses both rapid CSI ageing and severe bandwidth disparity across the SAGSIN protocol stack. Explicitly, an LLM-based long-range channel predictor forecasts the strongest delay-Doppler components several coherence intervals ahead, facilitating near-capacity reception despite violent channel fluctuations. Furthermore, our LLM-based semantic encoder turns raw sensor payloads into task-oriented tokens. This substantially reduces the SNR required for high-fidelity image delivery in a coastal underwater link, circumventing the data rate limitation by semantic communications. Inclusion of these tools creates a medium-agnostic adaptation layer that spans radio, optical and acoustic channels. We conclude with promising open research directions in on-device model compression, multimodal fidelity control, cross-layer resource orchestration and trustworthy operation, charting a path from laboratory prototypes to field deployment.</p>

Next, we employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential, visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.</p>

            <p>Despite significant advancements in music generation systems, the methodologies for evaluating generated music have not progressed as expected due to the complex nature of music, with aspects such as structure, coherence, creativity, and emotional expressiveness. In this paper, we shed light on this research gap, introducing a detailed taxonomy for evaluation metrics for both audio and symbolic music representations. We include a critical review identifying major limitations in current evaluation methodologies which includes poor correlation between objective metrics and human perception, cross-cultural bias, and lack of standardization that hinders cross-model comparisons. Addressing these gaps, we further propose future research directions towards building a comprehensive evaluation framework for music generation evaluation.</p>

            <h2>T-MLP: Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron for Level-of-Detail Signal Representation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanxiang Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Guangshun Wei, Siyu Ren, Yuan Liu, Junhui Hou, Wenping Wang</p>
            <p>Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a variety of signal representation tasks.</p>

            <h2>Privacy, Informed Consent and the Demand for Anonymisation of Smart Meter Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurab Chhachhi, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>Access to smart meter data offers system-wide benefits but raises significant privacy concerns due to the personal information it contains. Privacy-preserving techniques could facilitate wider access, though they introduce privacy-utility trade-offs. Understanding consumer valuations for anonymisation can help identify appropriate trade-offs. However, existing studies do not focus on anonymisation specifically or account for information asymmetries regarding privacy risks, raising questions about the validity of informed consent under current regulations. We use a mixed-methods approach to estimate non-monetary (willingness-to-share and smart metering demand) and monetary (willingness-to-pay/accept) preferences for anonymisation, based on a representative sample of 965 GB bill payers. An embedded randomised control trial examines the effect of providing information about privacy implications. On average, consumers are willing to pay for anonymisation, are more willing to share data when anonymised and less willing to share non-anonymised data once anonymisation is presented as an option. However, a significant minority remains unwilling to adopt smart meters, despite anonymisation. We find strong evidence of information asymmetries that suppress demand for anonymisation and identify substantial variation across demographic and electricity supply characteristics. Qualitative responses corroborate the quantitative findings, underscoring the need for stronger privacy defaults, user-centric design, and consent mechanisms that enable truly informed decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eyal Briman, Eyal Leizerovich, Nimrod Talmon</p>
            <p>We consider a specific scenario of text aggregation, in the realm of musical harmonization. Musical harmonization shares similarities with text aggregation, however the language of harmony is more structured than general text. Concretely, given a set of harmonization suggestions for a given musical melody, our interest lies in devising aggregation algorithms that yield an harmonization sequence that satisfies the following two key criteria: (1) an effective representation of the collective suggestions; and (2) an harmonization that is musically coherent. We present different algorithms for the aggregation of harmonies given by a group of agents and analyze their complexities. The results indicate that the Kemeny and plurality-based algorithms are most effective in assessing representation and maintaining musical coherence.</p>

            <p>Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p>

Using the AudioBox-Aesthetics system, we experimentally evaluate CoComposer on four compositional criteria. We test with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3-0324, Gemini-2.5-Flash), and find (1) that CoComposer outperforms existing multi-agent LLM-based systems in music quality, and (2) compared to a single-agent system, in production complexity. Compared to non- LLM MusicLM, CoComposer has better interpretability and editability, although MusicLM still produces better music.</p>

            <h2>Newton-Flow Particle Filters based on Generalized Cramér Distance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uwe D. Hanebeck</p>
            <p>We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized Cramér distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as a plugin replacement for classic approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Das, Yassine El Kheir, Carlos Franzreb, Tim Herzig, Tim Polzehl, Sebastian Möller</p>
            <p>Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever. Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end architectures.</p>

            <p>Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable sensors.

We find a particularly strong relevance of the convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks. The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further exploration.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Hidden Precursors to Earthquakes via a Stress-Sensitive Transformation of Seismic Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nader Shakibay Senobari</p>
            <p>Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Bioacoustic Generation via Enhanced Diffusion Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Song, Ton Viet Ta</p>
            <p>Generative modeling offers new opportunities for bioacoustics, enabling the synthesis of realistic animal vocalizations that could support biomonitoring efforts and supplement scarce data for endangered species. However, directly generating bird call waveforms from noisy field recordings remains a major challenge. We propose BirdDiff, a generative framework designed to synthesize bird calls from a noisy dataset of 12 wild bird species. The model incorporates a "zeroth layer" stage for multi-scale adaptive bird-call enhancement, followed by a diffusion-based generator conditioned on three modalities: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, species labels, and textual descriptions. The enhancement stage improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while minimizing spectral distortion, achieving the highest SNR gain (+10.45 dB) and lowest Itakura-Saito Distance (0.54) compared to three widely used non-training enhancement methods. We evaluate BirdDiff against a baseline generative model, DiffWave. Our method yields substantial improvements in generative quality metrics: Fréchet Audio Distance (0.590 to 0.213), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (0.259 to 0.226), and Number of Statistically-Different Bins (7.33 to 5.58). To assess species-specific detail preservation, we use a ResNet50 classifier trained on the original dataset to identify generated samples. Classification accuracy improves from 35.9% (DiffWave) to 70.1% (BirdDiff), with 8 of 12 species exceeding 70% accuracy. These results demonstrate that BirdDiff enables high-fidelity, controllable bird call generation directly from noisy field recordings.</p>

            <p>Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.</p>

            <h2>Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Tian, Chi Kit Ng, Hongliang Ren</p>
            <p>Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.</p>

            <p>Generative adversarial network-based models have shown remarkable performance in the field of speech enhancement. However, the current optimization strategies for these models predominantly focus on refining the architecture of the generator or enhancing the quality evaluation metrics of the discriminator. This approach often overlooks the rich contextual information inherent in diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a scenario-aware discriminator that captures scene-specific features and performs frequency-domain division, thereby enabling a more accurate quality assessment of the enhanced speech generated by the generator. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three representative models using two publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can effectively adapt to various generator architectures without altering their structure, thereby unlocking further performance gains in speech enhancement across different scenarios.</p>

            <p>Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent through the budget constraint. We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state, finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.</p>

            <p>Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool insertion efficacy.</p>

            <p>This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges, ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.</p>

            <p>Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p>

            <p>Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.</p>

            <h2>The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashwin Nagarajan, Hao-Wen Dong</p>
            <p>Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning, which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens. Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.</p>

            <h2>PicoAudio2: Temporal Controllable Text-to-Audio Generation with Natural Language Description</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Zheng, Zeyu Xie, Xuenan Xu, Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Mengyue Wu</p>
            <p>Controllable text-to-audio generation (TTA) has attracted much attention recently. Although existing works can achieve fine-grained controllability based on timestamp information, sound event categories are limited to a fixed set. Moreover, since only simulated data is used for training, the generated audio quality and generalization performance on real data are limited. To tackle this issue, we propose PicoAudio2, improving temporal-controllable TTA via a new data processing pipeline and model architecture. Specifically, we use a grounding model to annotate event timestamps of real audio-text datasets to curate temporally-strong real data, in addition to simulation data from existing works. The model is trained on the combination of real and simulation data. Moreover, following PicoAudio, we encode timestamp information into a timestamp matrix to provide extra fine-grained time-aligned information to the model, on top of the coarse-grained textual description. Experiments show that PicoAudio2 exhibits superior performance in terms of temporal controllability and audio quality.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic control of stochastic matching systems in heavy traffic: An effective computational method for high-dimensional problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baris Ata, Yaosheng Xu</p>
            <p>Bipartite matching systems arise in many settings where agents or tasks from two distinct sets must be paired dynamically under compatibility constraints. We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.</p>

            <h2>AImoclips: A Benchmark for Evaluating Emotion Conveyance in Text-to-Music Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gyehun Go, Satbyul Han, Ahyeon Choi, Eunjin Choi, Juhan Nam, Jeong Mi Park</p>
            <p>Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.</p>

            <p>Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C, DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban environments.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04% accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM) validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and hands-free control interfaces.</p>

            <h2>Controller synthesis method for multi-agent system based on temporal logic specification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Huang, Zining Cao</p>
            <p>Controller synthesis is a theoretical approach to the systematic design of discrete event systems. It constructs a controller to provide feedback and control to the system, ensuring it meets specified control specifications. Traditional controller synthesis methods often use formal languages to describe control specifications and are mainly oriented towards single-agent and non-probabilistic systems. With the increasing complexity of systems, the control requirements that need to be satisfied also become more complex. Based on this, this paper proposes a controller synthesis method for semi-cooperative semi-competitive multi-agent probabilistic discrete event systems to solve the controller synthesis problem based on temporal logic specifications. The controller can ensure the satisfaction of specifications to a certain extent. The specification is given in the form of a linear temporal logic formula. This paper designs a controller synthesis algorithm that combines probabilistic model checking. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified through a case study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaodong Ma, Kai Liu, Lipeng Zhu, Yanming Liu, Yanbo Zhu, Daniel Benevides da Costa</p>
            <p>The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA) arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems, fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.</p>

            <p>In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Cloud Computing (CC) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18 while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing intrusion detection systems in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Empowered Secure Near-Field MIMO Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaodong Ma, Kai Liu, Yanming Liu, Lipeng Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper. To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm. Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization (MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition, the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.</p>

            <p>The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables, with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i) Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model size. TinyMusician is the first mobile-deployable music generation model that eliminates cloud dependency while maintaining high audio fidelity and efficient resource usage</p>

            <p>Urban noise pollution poses a significant threat to public health, yet existing monitoring infrastructures offer limited spatial coverage and adaptability. This paper presents a scalable, low-cost, IoT-based, real-time environmental noise monitoring solution using mobile nodes (sensor nodes on a moving vehicle). The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with GPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals. The sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a laboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While laboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the performance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle. To address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on the IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along with the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best performance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration. The system was deployed in Hyderabad, India, through three measurement campaigns across 27 days, capturing 436,420 data points. Results highlight temporal and spatial noise variations across weekdays, weekends, and during Diwali. Incorporating vehicular velocity into the calibration significantly improves accuracy. The proposed system demonstrates the potential for widespread deployment of IoT-based noise sensing networks in smart cities, enabling effective noise pollution management and urban planning.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Denoising and Adaptation Framework for Self-Supervised Bengali Dialectal ASR</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swadhin Biswas, Imran, Tuhin Sheikh</p>
            <p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Bengali, the world's fifth most spoken language, remains a significant challenge, critically hindering technological accessibility for its over 270 million speakers. This challenge is compounded by two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal diversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments. While state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR for low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle environmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies for the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This paper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual challenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is uniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it inherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage fine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard Bengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently specializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data augmentation. The framework is rigorously evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark comprising multiple Bengali dialects under a wide range of simulated noisy conditions, from clean audio to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms strong baselines, including standard fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and the large-scale multilingual Whisper model. This work establishes a new state-of-the-art for this task and provides a scalable, effective blueprint for developing practical ASR systems for other low-resource, high-variation languages globally.</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Is Noisy Data a Blessing in Disguise? A Distributionally Robust Optimization Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chung-Han Hsieh, Rong Gan</p>
            <p>Noisy data are often viewed as a challenge for decision-making. This paper studies a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) that shows how such noise can be systematically incorporated. Rather than applying DRO to the noisy empirical distribution, we construct ambiguity sets over the \emph{latent} distribution by centering a Wasserstein ball at the noisy empirical distribution in the observation space and taking its inverse image through a known noise kernel. We validate this inverse-image construction by deriving a tractable convex reformulation and establishing rigorous statistical guarantees, including finite-sample performance and asymptotic consistency. Crucially, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, noisy data may be a ``blessing in disguise." Our noisy-data DRO model is less conservative than its direct counterpart, leading to provably higher optimal values and a lower price of ambiguity. In the context of fair resource allocation problems, we demonstrate that this robust approach can induce solutions that are structurally more equitable. Our findings suggest that managers can leverage uncertainty by harnessing noise as a source of robustness rather than treating it as an obstacle, producing more robust and strategically balanced decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Senura Hansaja Wanasekara, Van-Dinh Nguyen, Kok-Seng, M.-Duong Nguyen, Symeon Chatzinotas, Octavia A. Dobre</p>
            <p>Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.</p>

            <p>Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim- iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junxiang Liu, Junming Lin, Jiangtong Li, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Lindbäck Løvland, Lars Struen Imsland, Bjarne Grimstad</p>
            <p>Feedback optimization has emerged as an effective strategy for steady-state optimization of dynamical systems. By exploiting models of the steady-state input-output sensitivity, methods of this type are often sample efficient, and their use of feedback ensures that they are robust against model error. Still, this robustness has its limitations, and the dependence on a model may hinder convergence in settings with high model error. We investigate here the effect of a particular type of model error: bias due to identifying the model from closed-loop data. Our main results are a sufficient convergence condition, and a converse divergence condition. The convergence condition requires a matrix which depends on the closed-loop sensitivity and a noise-to-signal ratio of the data generating system to be positive definite. The negative definiteness of the same matrix characterizes an extreme case where the bias due to closed-loop data results in divergence of model-based feedback optimization.</p>

            <p>Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA (Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7 percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3 seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality tradeoffs.</p>

            <h2>Analysing the Language of Neural Audio Codecs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonyong Park, Shinnosuke Takamichi, David M. Chan, Shunsuke Kando, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari</p>
            <p>This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of more effective generative speech models.</p>

            <h2>CabinSep: IR-Augmented Mask-Based MVDR for Real-Time In-Car Speech Separation with Distributed Heterogeneous Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runduo Han, Yanxin Hu, Yihui Fu, Zihan Zhang, Yukai Jv, Li Chen, Lei Xie</p>
            <p>Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses (IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs, CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Abouzeid, Bilal Elbouardi, Mohamed Maged, Shady Shehata</p>
            <p>Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns, ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods. While recent models favor large-scale architectures with millions of parameters, ArabEmoNet achieves superior results with just 1 million parameters, 90 times smaller than HuBERT base and 74 times smaller than Whisper. This efficiency makes it ideal for resource-constrained environments. ArabEmoNet advances Arabic speech emotion recognition, offering exceptional performance and accessibility for real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Gerald Dcruz, Argyrios Zolotas, Niall Ross Greenwood, Miguel Arana-Catania</p>
            <p>With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts.</p>

            <h2>From Discord to Harmony: Decomposed Consonance-based Training for Improved Audio Chord Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Poltronieri, Xavier Serra, Martín Rocamora</p>
            <p>Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing. The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord labels from decomposed outputs.</p>

            <h2>Securing Radiation Detection Systems with an Efficient TinyML-Based IDS for Edge Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Einstein Rivas Pizarro, Wajiha Zaheer, Li Yang, Khalil El-Khatib, Glenn Harvel</p>
            <p>Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p>

            <h2>An Efficient Intrusion Detection System for Safeguarding Radiation Detection Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathanael Coolidge, Jaime González Sanz, Li Yang, Khalil El Khatib, Glenn Harvel, Nelson Agbemava, I Putu Susila, Mehmet Yavuz Yagci</p>
            <p>Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Coordinate: Distributed Meta-Trajectory Optimization Via Differentiable ADMM-DDP</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingheng Wang, Yichao Gao, Tianchen Sun, Lin Zhao</p>
            <p>Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quang Minh Nguyen, Eytan Modiano</p>
            <p>We propose a framework for resource provisioning with QoS guarantees in shared infrastructure networks. Our novel framework provides tunable probabilistic service guarantees for throughput and delay. Key to our approach is a Modified Dirft-plus-Penalty (MDP) policy that ensures long-term stability while capturing short-term probabilistic service guarantees using linearized upper-confidence bounds. We characterize the feasible region of service guarantees and show that our MDP procedure achieves mean rate stability and an optimality gap that vanishes with the frame size over which service guarantees are provided. Finally, empirical simulations validate our theory and demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm in handling QoS in multi-infrastructure networks.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel multi-layered hybrid security approach aimed at enhancing lightweight encryption for IoT-Cloud systems. The primary goal is to overcome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA, Blockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection, computational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically refines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while maximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable and high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous environments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging technologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when effectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security architecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the this http URL Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric, Enc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed, scalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer independently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and Auditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance across dynamic workloads. Evaluation results highlight that the proposed solution not only strengthens security but also significantly improves execution time, communication efficiency and system responsiveness, offering a robust path forward for next-generation IoT-Cloud infrastructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Sattarpour, Ali Barati, Hamid Barati</p>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.</p>

            <p>Machine learning has recently been adopted to emulate sensitivity matrices for real-time magnetic control of tokamak plasmas. However, these approaches would benefit from a quantification of possible inaccuracies. We report on two aspects of real-time applicability of emulators. First, we quantify the agreement of target displacement from VCs computed via Jacobians of the shape emulators with those from finite differences Jacobians on exact Grad-Shafranov solutions. Good agreement ($\approx$5-10%) can be achieved on a selection of geometric targets using combinations of neural network emulators with $\approx10^5$ parameters. A sample of $\approx10^{5}-10^{6}$ synthetic equilibria is essential to train emulators that are not over-regularised or overfitting. Smaller models trained on the shape targets may be further fine-tuned to better fit the Jacobians. Second, we address the effect of vessel currents that are not directly measured in real-time and are typically subsumed into effective "shaping currents" when designing virtual circuits. We demonstrate that shaping currents can be inferred via simple linear regression on a trailing window of active coil current measurements with residuals of only a few Ampères, enabling a choice for the most appropriate shaping currents at any point in a shot. While these results are based on historic shot data and simulations tailored to MAST-U, they indicate that emulators with few-millisecond latency can be developed for robust real-time plasma shape control in existing and upcoming tokamaks.</p>

            <p>Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.</p>

            <p>One might argue that solving a trajectory optimization problem over a million grid points is preposterous. How about solving such a problem at an incredibly fast computational time? On a small form-factor processor? Algorithmic details that make possible this trifecta of breakthroughs are presented in this paper.

A key enabler of this high performance is the computation of Birkhoff matrix-vector products at $\mathcal{O}(N\log(N))$ time using fast Fourier transform techniques that eliminate traditional computational bottlenecks. A numerical demonstration of this unprecedented scale and speed is illustrated for a practical astrodynamics problem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max T.M. Ng, Roman Engelhardt, Florian Dandl, Hani S. Mahmassani, Klaus Bogenberger</p>
            <p>This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs. This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in multimodal transit systems.</p>

            <p>Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration, integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and extending beyond aerial robotics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun Xie, Feiyu Shen, Junjie Li, Fenglong Xie, Xu Tang, Yao Hu</p>
            <p>Current dialogue generation approaches typically require the complete dialogue text before synthesis and produce a single, inseparable speech containing all voices, making them unsuitable for interactive chat; moreover, they suffer from unstable synthesis, inaccurate speaker transitions, and incoherent prosody. In this work, we present FireRedTTS-2, a long-form streaming TTS system for multi-speaker dialogue generation, delivering stable, natural speech with reliable speaker switching and context-aware prosody. A new 12.5Hz streaming speech tokenizer accelerates training and inference, extends maximum dialogue length, encodes richer semantics to stabilize text-to-token modeling and supports high-fidelity streaming generation for real-time applications. We adopt a text-speech interleaved format, concatenating speaker-labeled text with aligned speech tokens in chronological order, and model it with a dual-transformer: a large decoder-only transformer predicts tokens at the first layer, and a smaller one completes subsequent layers. Experimental results show that FireRedTTS-2 integrates seamlessly with chat frameworks and, with minimal fine-tuning, produces emotionally expressive speech guided by implicit contextual cues. In podcast generation, it surpasses existing systems including MoonCast, Zipvoice-Dialogue, and MOSS-TTSD in objective intelligibility, speaker-turn reliability, and perceived naturalness with context-consistent prosody.

            <p>Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) constellations demand routing that simultaneously minimizes energy, guarantees delivery under congestion, and meets latency requirements for time-critical flows. We present a segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) flexible algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework that consists of three logical slices: an energy-efficient slice (Algo 130), a high-reliability slice (Algo 129), and a latency-sensitive slice (Algo 128). The framework provides a unified mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that combines satellite CPU power, packet delivery rate (PDR), and end-to-end latency into a single objective, allowing a lightweight software-defined network (SDN) controller to steer traffic from the source node. Emulation of Telesat's Lightspeed constellation shows that, compared with different routing schemes, the proposed design reduces the average CPU usage by 73%, maintains a PDR above 91% during traffic bursts, and decreases urgent flow delay by 18 ms between Ottawa and Vancouver. The results confirm Flex-Algo's value as a slice-based traffic engineering (TE) tool for resource-constrained satellite networks.</p>

            <p>We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler, single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4 patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid. To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open foundation for future low-latency codec designs.</p>

This paper explores the use of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&CNET) accelerated using memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.</p>

We present TTA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA models across functional performance, reliability, and social responsibility. It covers seven dimensions including accuracy, robustness, fairness, and toxicity, and includes 2,999 diverse prompts generated through automated and manual methods. We introduce a unified evaluation protocol that combines objective metrics with over 118,000 human annotations from both experts and general users. Ten state-of-the-art models are benchmarked under this framework, offering detailed insights into their strengths and limitations.

            <h2>Constrained Stabilization on the n-Sphere with Conic and Star-shaped Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mayur Sawant, Abdelhamid Tayebi</p>
            <p>The problem of constrained stabilization on the n-sphere under star-shaped constraints is considered. We propose a control strategy that allows to almost globally steer the state to a desired location while avoiding star-shaped constraints on the n-sphere. Depending on the state's proximity to the unsafe regions, the state is either guided towards the target location along the geodesic connecting the target to the state or steered towards the antipode of a predefined point lying in the interior of the nearest unsafe region. We prove that the target location is almost globally asymptotically stable under the proposed continuous, time-invariant feedback control law. Nontrivial simulation results on the 2-sphere and the 3-sphere demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raj Kiriti Velicheti, Subhonmesh Bose, Tamer Başar</p>
            <p>Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games. Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games and quadratic Gaussian game setups.</p>

            <h2>Topology Inference for Network Systems with Unknown Inputs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qing Jiao, Yushan Li, Jianping He</p>
            <p>Topology inference is a powerful tool to better understand the behaviours of network systems (NSs). Different from most of prior works, this paper is dedicated to inferring the directed topology of NSs from noisy observations, where the nodes are influenced by unknown time-varying inputs. These inputs can be actively injected signals by the user, intrinsic system noises or extrinsic environment interference. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose a two-stage inference scheme to overcome the influence of the inputs. First, by leveraging the second-order difference of the state evolution, we establish a judging criterion to detect the input injection time and provide the probability guarantees. With this injection time to determine available observations, an initial topology is accordingly inferred to further facilitate the input estimation. Second, utilizing the stability characteristic of the system response, a recursive input filtering algorithm is designed to approximate the zero-input response, which directly reflects the topology structure. Then, we construct a decreasing-weight based optimization problem to infer the final network topology from the approximated response. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay Raina, Vipul Arora</p>
            <p>This study addresses the task of performing robust and reliable time-delay estimation in signals in noisy and reverberating environments. In contrast to the popular signal processing based methods, this paper proposes to transform the input signals using a deep neural network into another pair of sequences which show high cross correlation at the actual time delay. This is achieved with the help of a novel correlation function based objective function for training the network. The proposed approach is also intrinsically interpretable as it does not lose temporal information. Experimental evaluations are performed for estimating mutual time delays for different types of audio signals such as pulse, speech and musical beats. SyncNet outperforms other classical approaches, such as GCC-PHAT, and some other learning based approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunyu Pan, Xizhe Zhang, Haoyu Zheng, Zhao Su, Changsheng Zhang, Weixiong Zhang</p>
            <p>Real-world network systems are inherently dynamic, with network topologies undergoing continuous changes over time. Previous works often focus on static networks or rely on complete prior knowledge of evolving topologies, whereas real-world networks typically undergo stochastic structural changes that are difficult to predict in advance. To address this challenge, we define the adaptive control problem and propose an adaptive control algorithm to reduce the extra control cost caused by driver node switching. We introduce a node-level adaptive control metric to capture both the stability and consistency of each node across historical topologies. By integrating this metric with a partial matching repair strategy, our algorithm adjusts the minimum driver node set in real time at each snapshot, while minimizing unnecessary reconfigurations between consecutive time steps. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world dynamic networks demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control algorithm significantly outperforms the existing algorithm, reducing the switching cost by an average of 22% in synthetic networks and 19\% in real-world networks, without requiring foreknowledge of the future evolution of the network. These findings extend the theoretical scope of dynamic network controllability and open new avenues for practical applications in transportation, social, and molecular regulatory systems.</p>

            <p>Chest X-rays remain the primary diagnostic tool in emergency medicine, yet their limited ability to capture fine anatomical details can result in missed or delayed diagnoses. To address this, we introduce XVertNet, a novel deep-learning framework designed to enhance vertebral structure visualization in X-ray images significantly. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) An unsupervised learning architecture that eliminates reliance on manually labeled training data a persistent bottleneck in medical imaging, and (2) a dynamic self-tuned internal guidance mechanism featuring an adaptive feedback loop for real-time image optimization. Extensive validation across four major public datasets revealed that XVertNet outperforms state-of-the-art enhancement methods, as demonstrated by improvements in entropy scores, Tenengrad criterion values, the local phase coherence sharpness index (LPC-SI), and thetone mapped image quality index (TMQI). Furthermore, clinical validation conducted with two board-certified radiologists confirmed that the enhanced images enabled more sensitive detection of subtle vertebral fractures and degenerative changes. The unsupervised nature of XVertNet facilitates immediate clinical deployment without requiring additional training overhead. This innovation represents a transformative advancement in emergency radiology, providing a scalable and time-efficient solution to enhance diagnostic accuracy in high-pressure clinical environments.</p>

Our approach generalizes the well-established method of using an observer to estimate a constant disturbance to allow tracking constant setpoints with zero steady-state error. In this paper, the disturbance model is generalized to a nonlinear static function of the plant's state and command input, learned online, so as to perfectly track time-varying reference trajectories under certain assumptions on the model and provided that future reference samples are available. We compare our approach with the classical constant disturbance model in numerical simulations, showing its superiority.</p>

            <p>Modern speaker recognition system relies on abundant and balanced datasets for classification training. However, diverse defective datasets, such as partially-labelled, small-scale, and imbalanced datasets, are common in real-world applications. Previous works usually studied specific solutions for each scenario from the algorithm perspective. However, the root cause of these problems lies in dataset imperfections. To address these challenges with a unified solution, we propose the Voice Conversion Augmentation (VCA) strategy to obtain pseudo speech from the training set. Furthermore, to guarantee generation quality, we designed the VCA-NN~(nearest neighbours) strategy to select source speech from utterances that are close to the target speech in the representation space. Our experimental results on three created datasets demonstrated that VCA-NN effectively mitigates these dataset problems, which provides a new direction for handling the speaker recognition problems from the data aspect.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel Koopman composition operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to the well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. Consequently, our proposed framework allows for arbitrarily accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.</p>

            <p>The harsh environment and scarce resources post-disaster drive the equipment to be miniaturized and portable. Based on this, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems play a significant role in providing emergency wireless networks. In order to reduce the hardware cost, a hybrid beamforming (HBF) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, which exploits the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains, is considered in this paper. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom, thus leading to increased interference among communication users and radar sensing. To solve this problem, a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) strategy is adopted to enhance the emergency mmWave-ISAC system. We formulate the weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization objective by jointly designing common rate allocation and HBF. Then, we propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.</p>

A simulation study shows the proposed method achieves lower estimation error, higher speech-distortion-ratio (SDR), and comparable noise reduction (NR) within the sweet area in a reverberant environment, compared to a beamforming-and-projection method as the baseline.</p>

            <p>While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in general multimodal tasks, they lack the domain-specific knowledge for industrial vibration signal analysis. This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.</p>

            <p>Training a high-quality Federated Learning (FL) model at the network edge is challenged by limited transmission resources. Although various device scheduling strategies have been proposed, it remains unclear how scheduling decisions affect the FL model performance under temporal constraints. This is pronounced when the wireless medium is shared to enable the participation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices with distinct communication modes: (1) a scheduling (pull) scheme, that selects devices with valuable updates, and (2) random access (push), in which interested devices transmit model parameters. This work investigates the interplay of push-pull interactions in a time-constrained FL setting, where the communication opportunities are finite, with a utility-based analytical model. Using real-world datasets, we provide a performance tradeoff analysis that validates the significance of strategic device scheduling under push-pull wireless access for several practical settings.

            <p>Future wireless networks are envisioned to facilitate the seamless coexistence of communication and sensing functionalities, thereby enabling the much-touted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm. A key challenge in ISAC is managing inter-functionality interference while maintaining a balanced performance trade-off. In this work, we propose a rate-splitting (RS)-inspired approach to address this challenge in an uplink ISAC scenario, where a base station (BS) serves an uplink communication user while detecting a radar target. We derive inner bounds on the ergodic data information rate for the communication user and the ergodic radar estimation information rate for the sensing target. A closed-form solution is also derived for the optimal power split in RS that maximizes the communication user's performance. Compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA)- and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-inspired approaches, the proposed approach achieves a more favorable sensing-communication trade-off by virtue of the decoding order flexibility introduced through splitting the communication message. Notably, this is the first work to employ an RS-inspired strategy as a general framework for non-orthogonal coexistence of sensing and communication, extending its applicability beyond traditional digital-only settings.</p>

            <p>We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</p>

            <p>The enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model, which accounts for inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS), has been extensively utilized for evaluating nonlinear interference (NLI) within the C+L band. Compared to closed-form expressions and machine learning-based NLI evaluation models, it demonstrates broader applicability and its accuracy is not dependent on the support of large-scale datasets. However, its high computational complexity often results in lengthy computation times. Through analysis, the high-frequency oscillations of the four-wave mixing (FWM) efficiency factor integrand were identified as a primary factor limiting the computational speed of the ISRS EGN model. To address this issue, we propose an approximation method to derive a closed-form expression for the FWM efficiency factor, which provides both high accuracy and high computational efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the method proposed in this work could achieve low error levels under high ISRS influence levels, with an absolute mean error (MAE) of approximately 0.0033 dB. Furthermore, a parallel computation strategy targeting independent regions within the integration domain is proposed and optimized, which further significantly improves computing efficiency.</p>

In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</p>

            <p>Ensuring resilience in multi-energy systems (MESs) becomes both more urgent and more challenging due to the rising occurrence and severity of extreme events (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyber-physical attacks). Among many measures of strengthening MES resilience, the integration of hydrogen shows exceptional potential in cross-temporal flexibility, cross-spatial flexibility, cross-sector flexibility, and black start capability. Although many hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement measures have been developed, the current literature lacks a systematic overview of hydrogen-enabled resilience enhancement in MESs. To fill the research gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of hydrogen-enabled MES resilience enhancement. First, advantages and challenges of adopting hydrogen in MES resilience enhancement are summarized. Then, we propose a resilience enhancement framework for hydrogen-enabled MESs. Under the proposed framework, existing resilience metrics and event-oriented contingency models are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, we classify hydrogen-enabled planning measures by the types of hydrogen-related facilities and provide some insights for planning problem formulation frameworks. Moreover, we categorize the hydrogen-enabled operation enhancement measures into three operation response stages: preventive, emergency, and restoration. Finally, we identify some research gaps and point out possible future directions in aspects of comprehensive resilience metric design, temporally-correlated event-targeted scenario generation, multi-type temporal-spatial cyber-physical contingency modeling under compound extreme events, multi-network multi-timescale coordinated planning and operation, low-carbon resilient planning and operation, and large language model-assisted whole-process resilience enhancement.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the dynamic range and quantization noise power in modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Two modulo ADC systems are considered: (1) a modulo ADC which outputs the folded samples and an additional 1-bit folding information signal, and (2) a modulo ADC without the 1-bit information. A recovery algorithm that unfolds the quantized modulo samples using the extra 1-bit folding information is analyzed. Using the dithered quantization framework, we show that an oversampling factor of $\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and a quantizer resolution of $b > 3$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. When these conditions are met, we demonstrate that the mean squared error (MSE) performance of modulo ADC with an extra 1-bit folding information signal is better than that of a conventional ADC with the same number of bits used for amplitude quantization. Since folding information is typically not available in modulo ADCs, we also propose and analyze a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that does not require the 1-bit folding information. In this case, we prove that $\mathrm{OF} > 3$ and $b > 3 + \log_2(\delta)$ for some $\delta > 1$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. For the two systems considered, we show that, with sufficient number of bits for amplitude quantization, the mean squared error (MSE) of a modulo ADC is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}^3}\right)$ whereas that of a conventional ADC is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}}\right)$. We extend the analysis to the case of simultaneous acquisition of weak and strong signals occupying different frequency bands. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the derived performance guarantees.</p>

            <p>We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Wen, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, William Freeman, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An</p>
            <p>We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work that studies retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.</p>

            <h2>Port-LLM: A Port Prediction Method for Fluid Antenna based on Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yali Zhang, Haifan Yin, Weidong Li, Emil Bjornson, Merouane Debbah</p>
            <p>The objective of this study is to address the mobility challenges faced by user equipment (UE) through the implementation of fluid antenna (FA) on the UE side. This approach aims to maintain the time-varying channel in a relatively stable state by strategically relocating the FA to an appropriate port. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces, for the first time, the application of large language models (LLMs) in the prediction of FA ports, presenting a novel model termed Port-LLM. Our proposed method for predicting the moving port of the FA is a two-step prediction method. To enhance the learning efficacy of our proposed Port-LLM model, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Additionally, to further exploit the natural language processing capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, we propose a framework named Prompt-Port-LLM, which is constructed upon the Port-LLM architecture and incorporates prompt fine-tuning techniques along with a specialized prompt encoder module. The simulation results show that our proposed models all exhibit strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium-to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing methods, the performance of the port predicted by our models demonstrates superior efficacy. Moreover, both of our proposed models achieve millimeter-level inference speed.</p>

            <h2>NeuroAMP: A Novel End-to-end General Purpose Deep Neural Amplifier for Personalized Hearing Aids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shafique Ahmed, Ryandhimas E. Zezario, Hui-Guan Yuan, Amir Hussain, Hsin-Min Wang, Wei-Ho Chung, Yu Tsao</p>
            <p>The prevalence of hearing aids is increasing. However, optimizing the amplification processes of hearing aids remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modular components in traditional methods. To address this challenge, we present NeuroAMP, a novel deep neural network designed for end-to-end, personalized amplification in hearing aids. NeuroAMP leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI) on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ). Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results highlight the potential of NeuroAMP and Denoising NeuroAMP to deliver notable improvements in personalized hearing aid amplification.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Synthetic-to-Real Gaps: Frequency-Aware Perturbation and Selection for Single-shot Multi-Parametric Mapping Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linyu Fan, Che Wang, Ming Ye, Qizhi Yang, Zejun Wu, Xinghao Ding, Yue Huang, Jianfeng Bao, Shuhui Cai, Congbo Cai</p>
            <p>Data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) has remarkably advanced medical imaging, with emerging methods using synthetic data to address data scarcity while introducing synthetic-to-real gaps. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) shows promise in ground truth-scarce tasks, but its application in reconstruction remains underexplored. Although multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) achieves ultra-fast multi-parametric reconstruction, extending its application to various clinical scenarios, the quality suffers from deficiency in mitigating the domain gap, difficulty in maintaining structural integrity, and inadequacy in ensuring mapping accuracy. To resolve these issues, we proposed frequency-aware perturbation and selection (FPS), comprising Wasserstein distance-modulated frequency-aware perturbation (WDFP) and hierarchical frequency-aware selection network (HFSNet), which integrates frequency-aware adaptive selection (FAS), compact FAS (cFAS) and feature-aware architecture integration (FAI). Specifically, perturbation activates domain-invariant feature learning within uncertainty, while selection refines optimal solutions within perturbation, establishing a robust and closed-loop learning pathway. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, along with diverse real clinical cases from 5 healthy volunteers, 94 ischemic stroke patients, and 46 meningioma patients, demonstrate the superiority and clinical applicability of FPS. Furthermore, FPS is applied to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), underscoring its versatility and potential for broader medical applications. The code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Brain nuclei are clusters of anatomically distinct neurons that serve as important hubs for processing and relaying information in various neural circuits. Fine-scale parcellation of the brain nuclei is vital for a comprehensive understanding of its anatomico-functional correlations. Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that can estimate the brain's white matter structural connectivity to potentially reveal the topography of the nuclei of interest for studying its subdivisions. In this work, we present a deep clustering pipeline, namely DeepNuParc, to perform automated, fine-scale parcellation of brain nuclei using diffusion MRI tractography. First, we incorporate a newly proposed deep learning approach to enable accurate segmentation of the nuclei of interest directly on the dMRI data. Next, we design a novel streamline clustering-based structural connectivity feature for a robust representation of voxels within the nuclei. Finally, we improve the popular joint dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering approach to enable nuclei parcellation at a finer scale. We demonstrate DeepNuParc on two important brain structures, i.e. the amygdala and the thalamus, that are known to have multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei subdivisions. Experimental results show that DeepNuParc enables consistent parcellation of the nuclei into multiple parcels across multiple subjects and achieves good correspondence with the widely used coarse-scale atlases.

            <h2>Goal-Oriented Remote Tracking Through Correlated Observations in Pull-based Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abolfazl Zakeri, Mohammad Moltafet, Marian Codreanu</p>
            <p>We address the real-time remote tracking problem in a status update system comprising two sensors, two independent information sources, and a remote monitor. The status updating follows a pull-based communication, where the monitor commands/pulls the sensors for status updates, i.e., the actual state of the sources. We consider that the observations are \textit{correlated}, meaning that each sensor's sent data could also include the state of the other source due to, e.g., inter-sensor communications or overlapping monitoring regions. The effectiveness of data communication is measured by a generic distortion, capturing the underlying application goal. We provide optimal command/pulling policies for the monitor that minimize the average weighted sum distortion and transmission cost. Since the monitor cannot fully observe the exact state of each source, we propose a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and reformulate it as a belief MDP problem. We then effectively truncate the infinite belief space and transform it into a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved via relative value iteration. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the derived policy over age-based and deep-Q network baseline policies.</p>

            <h2>SALT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelrahman Elsayed, Sarim Hashmi, Mohammed Elseiagy, Hu Wang, Mohammad Yaqub, Ibrahim Almakky</p>
            <p>The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model weights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen rank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates by modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit variable performance across datasets. We propose SALT (Singular Value Adaptation with Low-Rank Transformation), a method that selectively adapts the most influential singular values using trainable scale and shift parameters while complementing this with a low-rank update for the remaining subspace. This hybrid approach harnesses the advantages of both LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on 5 challenging medical datasets, ranging from as few as 20 samples to 1000, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT (LoRA and SVD) by 2% to 5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters, demonstrating robust adaptation even in low-resource settings.

            <h2>Optimizing Breast Cancer Detection in Mammograms: A Comprehensive Study of Transfer Learning, Resolution Reduction, and Multi-View Classification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel G. P. Petrini, Hae Yong Kim</p>
            <p>Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation.

            <p>Counterfactual medical image generation enables clinicians to explore clinical hypotheses, such as predicting disease progression, facilitating their decision-making. While existing methods can generate visually plausible images from disease progression prompts, they produce silent predictions that lack interpretation to verify how the generation reflects the hypothesized progression -- a critical gap for medical applications that require traceable reasoning. In this paper, we propose Interpretable Counterfactual Generation (ICG), a novel task requiring the joint generation of counterfactual images that reflect the clinical hypothesis and interpretation texts that outline the visual changes induced by the hypothesis. To enable ICG, we present ICG-CXR, the first dataset pairing longitudinal medical images with hypothetical progression prompts and textual interpretations. We further introduce ProgEmu, an autoregressive model that unifies the generation of counterfactual images and textual interpretations. We demonstrate the superiority of ProgEmu in generating progression-aligned counterfactuals and interpretations, showing significant potential in enhancing clinical decision support and medical education.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli</p>
            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustave Bainier, Alessio Franci</p>
            <p>We introduce a generalized excitable system in which spikes can happen in a continuum of directions, therefore drastically enriching the expressivity and control capability of the spiking dynamics. In this generalized excitable system, spiking trajectories happen in a Hilbert space with an excitable resting state at the origin and spike responses that can be triggered in any direction as a function of the system's state and inputs. State-dependence of the spiking direction provide the system with a vanishing spiking memory trace, which enables robust tracking and integration of inputs in the spiking direction history. The model exhibits generalized forms of both Hodgkin's Type I and Type II excitability, capturing their usual bifurcation behaviors in an abstract setting. When used as the controller of a two-dimensional navigation task, this model facilitates both the sparseness of the actuation and its sensitivity to environmental inputs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed generalized excitable model for excitable control in high- and infinite-dimensional spaces.</p>

The technical derivation of the strategy (i) leverages existing non-asymptotic identification bounds with self-normalized martingales, (ii) utilizes spectral lines to predict the effect of sinusoidal excitation, and (iii) effectively accounts for spectral transient error and parametric uncertainty.

            <p>This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach refines the parameter estimates online using set-membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to a robust adaptive MPC scheme without iterative learning of the terminal ingredients.</p>

The model accounts for the cumulative effects of cascaded optical filters, amplifier-induced ASE noise, and transceiver noise, alongside digital equalization at the receiver.

These models capture the impact of colored noise resulting from linear filtering and provide both time and frequency-domain insights. The proposed framework is validated through experimental comparisons using accurately modeled optical filters, demonstrating close agreement between theory and practice and offering a robust foundation for system-level performance evaluation in metro-access networks.</p>

            <p>Covert communications provide a stronger privacy protection than cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS). However, previous works on covert communications have implicitly assumed the validity of channel reciprocity, i.e., wireless channels remain constant or approximately constant during their coherence time. In this work, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco RIS (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, where the DRIS with random and time-varying reflective coefficients acts as a "disco ball", introducing timevarying fully-passive jamming (FPJ). Consequently, the channel reciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities of Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional jamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we first design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of time-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error probabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the signal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob. Based on the detection rule, we derive the detection threshold for the warden Willie to detect whether communications between Alice and Bob is ongoing, considering the time-varying DRIS-based FPJ. Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses of the FAR and the MDR at the warden Willie, as well as SJNR at Bob, and then present unique properties of the DRIS-based FPJ in covert communications. We present numerical results to validate the derived theoretical analyses and evaluate the impact of DRIS on covert communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junliang Ye, Lei Wang, Md Zakir Hossain</p>
            <p>Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.</p>

            <p>This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T>0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem. We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T < T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.</p>

            <p>The defining characteristic of event-based control is that feedback loops are only closed when indicated by a triggering condition that takes recent information about the system into account. This stands in contrast to periodic control where the feedback loop is closed periodically. Benefits of event-based control arise when sampling comes at a cost, which occurs, e.g., for Networked Control Systems or in other setups with resource constraints. A rapidly growing number of publications deals with event-based control. Nevertheless, some fundamental questions about event-based control are still unsolved. In this article, we provide an overview of current research trends in event-based control. We focus on results that aim for a better understanding of effects that occur in feedback loops with event-based control.

            <p>Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on >4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research.

            <p>We propose a self-speaker adaptation method for streaming multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR) that eliminates the need for explicit speaker queries. Unlike conventional approaches requiring target speaker embeddings or enrollment audio, our technique dynamically adapts individual ASR instances through speaker-wise speech activity prediction. The key innovation involves injecting speaker-specific kernels generated via speaker supervision activations into selected ASR encoder layers. This enables instantaneous speaker adaptation to target speakers while handling fully overlapped speech even in a streaming scenario. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in both offline and streaming scenarios, demonstrating that our self-adaptive method effectively addresses severe speech overlap through streamlined speaker-focused recognition. The results validate the proposed self-speaker adaptation approach as a robust solution for multi-talker ASR under severe overlapping speech conditions.</p>

            <p>The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.</p>

            <h2>MMOC: Self-Supervised EEG Emotion Recognition Framework with Multi-Model Online Collaboration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanqi Wang, Yang Liu, Peng Ye, Liang Song</p>
            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) emotion recognition plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction, particularly in healthcare and neuroscience. While supervised learning has been widely used, its reliance on manual annotations introduces high costs and potential bias. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by generating labels through pretext tasks. However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals leads to significant data drift, limiting self-supervised models' generalization across unseen subjects. Traditional domain adaptation (DA) methods require access to target-domain data during training. Although domain generalization (DG) avoids this constraint, it often falls short in handling complex data drift due to limited coverage of possible target distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose MMOC, a self-supervised framework with multi-model online collaboration (MMOC), to achieve online adaptation to unseen data. MMOC trains multiple base models using diverse strategies rooted in reconstruction and contrastive learning, enabling each model to develop distinct generalization capabilities. During inference, MMOC dynamically activates the most suitable model for each test sample via a loss-based routing mechanism that evaluates both contrastive and reconstruction losses. This dual consideration allows for a comprehensive measurement of data drift at both structural and semantic levels. Experimental results on the SEED and Dreamer datasets show that MMOC achieves state-of-the-art performance: 85.39% on SEED, and 68.77% and 69.37% on Dreamer arousal and valence dimensions, respectively. MMOC effectively mitigates inter-subject data drift, offering a practical solution for real-world EEG emotion recognition.</p>

            <h2>Towards channel foundation models (CFMs): Motivations, methodologies and opportunities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Jiang, Yuan Gao, Xinyi Wu, Shugong Xu</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems. However, conventional AI-based models encounter several limitations, such as heavy reliance on labeled data, limited generalization capability, and task-specific design. To address these challenges, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of channel foundation models (CFMs)-a novel and unified framework designed to tackle a wide range of channel-related tasks through a pretrained, universal channel feature extractor. By leveraging advanced AI architectures and self-supervised learning techniques, CFMs are capable of effectively exploiting large-scale unlabeled data without the need for extensive manual annotation. We further analyze the evolution of AI methodologies, from supervised learning and multi-task learning to self-supervised learning, emphasizing the distinct advantages of the latter in facilitating the development of CFMs. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive review of existing studies on self-supervised learning in this domain, categorizing them into generative, discriminative and the combined paradigms. Given that the research on CFMs is still at an early stage, we identify several promising future research directions, focusing on model architecture innovation and the construction of high-quality, diverse channel datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Zhang, Baotong Tian, Zhiyao Duan</p>
            <p>Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective metrics. Audio samples can be found at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiny Choudhury, Michael Davidson, George Tynan</p>
            <p>Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping constraints. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to its fuel cycle and associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint for power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused from the transient buildup of neutron-absorbing xenon following a power reduction. This transient can delay or prevent subsequent power ramp-up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly, leading to prolonged downtimes. This work introduces a physics-informed modeling framework that embeds fuel cycle dynamics within a unit commitment (UC) formulation. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically enforces xenon induced constraints, and endogenously schedules refueling outages based on core conditions. By capturing intracycle reactivity evolution, the model enables operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both techno-economic requirements and irreducible nuclear physics limits. Application to a representative reactor fleet shows that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. Results further demonstrate that different operational modes substantially affect VRE utilization, curtailment, and nuclear fleet capacity factors. These findings highlight the importance of fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling for accurate reactor scheduling and integration of nuclear power into energy system models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Trombetta, Carole Lartizien</p>
            <p>Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangfei Sheng, Xiaofeng Pan, Zhichao Yang, Pengfei Chen, Leida Li</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores, FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences. Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and model weights have been released in this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Nazeri, Thom Badings, Anne-Kathrin Schmuck, Sadegh Soudjani, Alessandro Abate</p>
            <p>We study the automated abstraction-based synthesis of correct-by-construction control policies for stochastic dynamical systems with unknown dynamics. Our approach is to learn an abstraction from sampled data, which is represented in the form of a finite Markov decision process (MDP). In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for constructing finite-state interval MDP (IMDP) abstractions of stochastic systems with unknown nonlinear dynamics. As a distinguishing and novel feature, our technique only requires (1) noisy state-input-state observations and (2) an upper bound on the system's Lipschitz constant. Combined with standard model-checking techniques, our IMDP abstractions enable the synthesis of policies that satisfy probabilistic temporal properties (such as "reach-while-avoid") with a predefined confidence. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p>

            <p>Multimodal semantic communication has gained widespread attention due to its ability to enhance downstream task performance. A key challenge in such systems is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality. To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.</p>

            <p>For nonlinear multi-agent systems with high relative degrees, achieving formation control and obstacle avoidance in a distributed manner remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed safety-critical model predictive control (DSMPC) algorithm that incorporates discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHCBFs) to enforce safety constraints, alongside discrete-time control Lyapunov functions (DCLFs) to establish terminal constraints. To facilitate distributed implementation, we develop estimated neighbor states for formulating DHCBFs and DCLFs, while also devising a bound constraint to limit estimation errors and ensure convergence. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees regarding the feasibility and stability of the proposed DSMPC algorithm based on a mild assumption. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evidenced by the simulation results, demonstrating improved performance and reduced computation time compared to existing approaches.</p>

            <p>The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.</p>

            <p>Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangdi Hu, Keyi Liao, Jian Ye, Feng Guo</p>
            <p>Accurate state of charge (SOC) estimation is critical for ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Electrochemical models provide high fidelity for SOC estimation but introduce challenges due to parameter variations, nonlinearities, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer(SMO) based on an improved electrochemical single-particle model. The algorithm integrates a state observer for SOC estimation and a parameter observer for online parameter adaptation. A Lyapunov-derived adaptive dead-zone is introduced to ensure stability, activating parameter updates only when the terminal voltage error lies within a rigorously defined bound. The proposed method was validated under constant-current and UDDS dynamic conditions. Results demonstrate that the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO achieves superior accuracy compared with conventional dual SMO and equivalent circuit model-based EKF methods, maintaining SOC estimation errors within 0.2% under correct initialization and below 1% under a 30% initial SOC error, with rapid convergence. Computational efficiency analysis further shows that the adaptive dead-zone dual sliding mode observer reduces execution time compared with the conventional dual SMO by limiting unnecessary parameter updates, highlighting its suitability for real-time battery management applications. Moreover, robustness under battery aging was confirmed using a cycle-aging model, where the adaptive dead-zone dual SMO maintained stable SOC estimation despite parameter drift. These findings indicate that the proposed method offers a reliable, accurate, and computationally efficient solution for SOC estimation.</p>

            <p>Speaker verification aims to verify whether an input speech corresponds to the claimed speaker, and conventionally, this kind of system is deployed based on single-stream scenario, wherein the feature extractor operates in full frequency range. In this paper, we hypothesize that machine can learn enough knowledge to do classification task when listening to partial frequency range instead of full frequency range, which is so called frequency selection technique, and further propose a novel framework of multi-stream Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with this technique for speaker verification tasks. The proposed framework accommodates diverse temporal embeddings generated from multiple streams to enhance the robustness of acoustic modeling. For the diversity of temporal embeddings, we consider feature augmentation with frequency selection, which is to manually segment the full-band of frequency into several sub-bands, and the feature extractor of each stream can select which sub-bands to use as target frequency domain. Different from conventional single-stream solution wherein each utterance would only be processed for one time, in this framework, there are multiple streams processing it in parallel. The input utterance for each stream is pre-processed by a frequency selector within specified frequency range, and post-processed by mean normalization. The normalized temporal embeddings of each stream will flow into a pooling layer to generate fused embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on VoxCeleb dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that multi-stream CNN significantly outperforms single-stream baseline with 20.53 % of relative improvement in minimum Decision Cost Function (minDCF).</p>

            <p>This paper considers the joint compression and enhancement problem for speech signal in the presence of noise. Recently, the SoundStream codec, which relies on end-to-end joint training of an encoder-decoder pair and a residual vector quantizer by a combination of adversarial and reconstruction losses,has shown very promising performance, especially in subjective perception quality. In this work, we provide a theoretical result to show that, to simultaneously achieve low distortion and high perception in the presence of noise, there exist an optimal two-stage optimization procedure for the joint compression and enhancement problem. This procedure firstly optimizes an encoder-decoder pair using only distortion loss and then fixes the encoder to optimize a perceptual decoder using perception loss. Based on this result, we construct a two-stage training framework for joint compression and enhancement of noisy speech signal. Unlike existing training methods which are heuristic, the proposed two-stage training method has a theoretical foundation. Finally, experimental results for various noise and bit-rate conditions are provided. The results demonstrate that a codec trained by the proposed framework can outperform SoundStream and other representative codecs in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

            <p>Graphs are commonly used to model various complex systems, including social networks, power grids, transportation networks, and biological systems. In many applications, the connectivity of these networks can be expressed through the Mean First Passage Times (MFPTs) of a Markov chain modeling a random walker on the graph. In this paper, we generalize the network metrics based on Markov chains' MFPTs and extend them to networks affected by uncertainty, in which edges may fail and hence not be present according to a pre-determined stochastic model. To find optimally connected Markov chains, we present a parameterization-free method for optimizing the MFPTs of the Markov chain. More specifically, we present an efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm in the context of Markov chain optimization. The proposed algorithm is suitable for both fixed and random networks. Using various numerical experiments, we demonstrate scalability compared to established benchmarks. Importantly, our algorithm finds an optimal solution without requiring prior knowledge of edge failure probabilities, allowing for an online optimization approach.</p>

            <p>We consider multi-agent systems with cooperative interactions and study the convergence to consensus in the case of time-dependent connections, with possible communication failure. We prove a new condition ensuring consensus: we define a graph in which directed arrows correspond to connection functions that converge (in the weak sense) to some function with a positive integral on all intervals of the form $[t,+\infty)$. If the graph has a node reachable from all other indices, i.e.~``globally reachable'', then the system converges to consensus. We show that this requirement generalizes some known sufficient conditions for convergence, such as Moreau's or the Persistent Excitation one. We also give a second new condition, transversal to the known ones: total connectedness of the undirected graph formed by the non-vanishing of limiting functions.</p>

            <p>Controlling the style and characteristics of speech synthesis is crucial for adapting the output to specific contexts and user requirements. Previous Text-to-speech (TTS) works have focused primarily on the technical aspects of producing natural-sounding speech, such as intonation, rhythm, and clarity. However, they overlook the fact that there is a growing emphasis on spatial perception of synthesized speech, which may provide immersive experience in gaming and virtual reality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we present a novel multi-modal TTS approach, namely Image-indicated Immersive Text-to-speech Synthesis (I2TTS). Specifically, we introduce a scene prompt encoder that integrates visual scene prompts directly into the synthesis pipeline to control the speech generation process. Additionally, we propose a reverberation classification and refinement technique that adjusts the synthesized mel-spectrogram to enhance the immersive experience, ensuring that the involved reverberation condition matches the scene accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves high-quality scene and spatial matching without compromising speech naturalness, marking a significant advancement in the field of context-aware speech synthesis.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hallee E. Wong, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, John Guttag, Adrian V. Dalca</p>
            <p>Medical researchers and clinicians often need to perform novel segmentation tasks on a set of related images. Existing methods for segmenting a new dataset are either interactive, requiring substantial human effort for each image, or require an existing set of previously labeled images. We introduce a system, MultiverSeg, that enables practitioners to rapidly segment an entire new dataset without requiring access to any existing labeled data from that task or domain. Along with the image to segment, the model takes user interactions such as clicks, bounding boxes or scribbles as input, and predicts a segmentation. As the user segments more images, those images and segmentations become additional inputs to the model, providing context. As the context set of labeled images grows, the number of interactions required to segment each new image decreases. We demonstrate that MultiverSeg enables users to interactively segment new datasets efficiently, by amortizing the number of interactions per image to achieve an accurate segmentation. Compared to using a state-of-the-art interactive segmentation method, MultiverSeg reduced the total number of clicks by 36% and scribble steps by 25% to achieve 90% Dice on sets of images from unseen tasks.

            <h2>Full-Head Segmentation of MRI with Abnormal Brain Anatomy: Model and Data Release</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew M Birnbaum, Adam Buchwald, Peter Turkeltaub, Adam Jacks, George Carra, Shreya Kannana, Yu Huang, Abhisheck Datta, Lucas C Parra, Lukas A Hirsch</p>
            <p>Purpose: The goal of this work was to develop a deep network for whole-head segmentation including clinical MRIs with abnormal anatomy, and compile the first public benchmark dataset for this purpose. We collected 98 MRIs with volumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including normal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders of consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually correcting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a MultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in sagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D segmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores of 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation including gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors and 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this task. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for coregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal anatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate and robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used modeling toolbox for transcranial electric this http URL: We are releasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in abnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs including labels for non-brain structures. Together the model and data may serve as a benchmark for future efforts.</p>

            <h2>Safety-Critical Human-Machine Shared Driving for Vehicle Collision Avoidance based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiyue Zhao, Junzhi Zhang, Rui Zhou, Neda Masoud, Jianxiong Li, Helai Huang, Shijie Zhao</p>
            <p>Road safety continues to be a pressing global issue, with vehicle collisions imposing significant human, societal, and economic burdens. Human-machine shared collision avoidance in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a RL agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.</p>

            <h2>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous Manipulation on Humanoids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toru Lin, Kartik Sachdev, Linxi Fan, Jitendra Malik, Yuke Zhu</p>
            <p>Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Dynamics Models with Generative State Estimation for Cloth Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tongxuan Tian, Haoyang Li, Bo Ai, Xiaodi Yuan, Zhiao Huang, Hao Su</p>
            <p>Cloth manipulation is challenging due to its highly complex dynamics, near-infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent self-occlusions, which complicate both state estimation and dynamics modeling. Inspired by recent advances in generative models, we hypothesize that these expressive models can effectively capture intricate cloth configurations and deformation patterns from data. Therefore, we propose a diffusion-based generative approach for both perception and dynamics modeling. Specifically, we formulate state estimation as reconstructing full cloth states from partial observations and dynamics modeling as predicting future states given the current state and robot actions. Leveraging a transformer-based diffusion model, our method achieves accurate state reconstruction and reduces long-horizon dynamics prediction errors by an order of magnitude compared to prior approaches. We integrate our dynamics models with model predictive control and show that our framework enables effective cloth folding on real robotic systems, demonstrating the potential of generative models for deformable object manipulation under partial observability and complex dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernd Zimmering, Cecília Coelho, Vaibhav Gupta, Maria Maleshkova, Oliver Niggemann</p>
            <p>Modelling forced dynamical systems - where an external input drives the system state - is critical across diverse domains such as engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In this work, we propose Laplace-Net, a decoupled, solver-free neural framework for learning forced and delay-aware systems. It leverages a Laplace transform-based approach to decompose internal dynamics, external inputs, and initial values into established theoretical concepts, enhancing interpretability. Laplace-Net promotes transferability since the system can be rapidly re-trained or fine-tuned for new forcing signals, providing flexibility in applications ranging from controller adaptation to long-horizon forecasting. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets - including linear, non-linear, and delayed systems - demonstrate the method's improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling complex and previously unseen inputs.</p>

            <h2>SafeLink: Safety-Critical Control Under Dynamic and Irregular Unsafe Regions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songqiao Hu, Zidong Wang, Zeyi Liu, Zhen Shen, Xiao He</p>
            <p>Control barrier functions (CBFs) provide a theoretical foundation for safety-critical control in robotic systems. However, most existing methods rely on the analytical expressions of unsafe state regions, which are often impractical for irregular and dynamic unsafe regions. This paper introduces SafeLink, a novel CBF construction method based on cost-sensitive incremental random vector functional-link (RVFL) neural networks. By designing a valid cost function, SafeLink assigns different sensitivities to safe and unsafe state points, thereby eliminating false negatives in classification of unsafe state points. Furthermore, an incremental update theorem is established, enabling precise real-time adaptation to changes in unsafe regions. An analytical expression for the gradient of SafeLink is also derived to facilitate control input computation. The proposed method is validated on the endpoint position control task of a nonlinear two-link manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the method effectively learns the unsafe regions and rapidly adapts as these regions change, achieving an update speed significantly faster than comparison methods, while safely reaching the target position.

            <h2>Composable Uncertainty in Symmetric Monoidal Categories for Design Problems (Extended Version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Furter, Yujun Huang, Gioele Zardini</p>
            <p>Applied category theory often studies symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs) whose morphisms represent open systems. These structures naturally accommodate complex wiring patterns, leveraging (co)monoidal structures for splitting and merging wires, or compact closed structures for feedback. A key example is the compact closed SMC of design problems (DP), which enables a compositional approach to co-design in engineering. However, in practice, the systems of interest may not be fully known. Recently, Markov categories have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling uncertain processes. In this work, we demonstrate how to integrate this perspective into the study of open systems while preserving consistency with the underlying SMC structure. To this end, we employ the change-of-base construction for enriched categories, replacing the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal $\mathcal{V}$-category $\mathcal{C}$ with parametric maps $A \to \mathcal{C}(X,Y)$ in a Markov category induced by a symmetric monoidal monad. This results in a symmetric monoidal 2-category $N_*\mathcal{C}$ with the same objects as $\mathcal{C}$ and reparametrization 2-cells. By choosing different monads, we capture various types of uncertainty. The category underlying $\mathcal{C}$ embeds into $N_*\mathcal{C}$ via a strict symmetric monoidal functor, allowing (co)monoidal and compact closed structures to be transferred. Applied to DP, this construction leads to categories of practical relevance, such as parametrized design problems for optimization, and parametrized distributions of design problems for decision theory and Bayesian learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Pol Mestres, Jorge Cortés, W.P.M.H. Heemels</p>
            <p>Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Da Col, Cristian R. Rojas, Vikram Krishnamurthy</p>
            <p>Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance deterioration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mert Can Cakmak, Nitin Agarwal, Diwash Poudel</p>
            <p>Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the full semantic and visual richness of video content remains challenging. We introduce TriPSS, a tri-modal framework that integrates perceptual features from the CIELAB color space, structural embeddings from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. These modalities are fused using principal component analysis to form compact multi-modal embeddings, enabling adaptive video segmentation via HDBSCAN clustering. A refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically diverse. Evaluations on the TVSum20 and SumMe benchmarks show that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both unimodal and prior multimodal approaches. These results highlight TriPSS' ability to capture complementary visual and semantic cues, establishing it as an effective solution for video summarization, retrieval, and large-scale multimedia understanding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingze Ding, Zijian Zhou, Lipeng Zhu, Yuping Zhao, Bingli Jiao, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper investigates energy efficiency maximization for movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user uplink communication systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption incurred by practical antenna movement. We first examine the special case with a single user and propose an optimization algorithm based on the one-dimensional (1D) exhaustive search to maximize the user's energy efficiency. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the energy efficiency and analyze the conditions required to achieve this performance bound under different numbers of channel paths. Then, for the general multi-user scenario, we propose an iterative algorithm to fairly maximize the minimum energy efficiency among all users. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving energy efficiency compared to existing MA schemes that do not account for movement-related costs, as well as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) scheme. In addition, the results show the robustness of the proposed scheme to imperfect channel state information (CSI) and provide valuable insights for practical system deployment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Dickens, Kamyar Hamad</p>
            <p>Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel, memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. Project code and pre-processed data is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Zhang</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Declan S. Jagt, Matthew M. Peet</p>
            <p>Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how stability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can be more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on an analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator, $\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper, we show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to multiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of lifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain is well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which is necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate spatial differential operator, $D^\alpha=\partial_{s_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\partial_{s_N}^{\alpha_N}$, on the PDE domain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable kernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any suitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE, parameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for PDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of positive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the process of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is used to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining accurate bounds on the rate of decay.</p>

            <p>Contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems allow for recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, such as named entities or rare words. However, it remains challenging due to limited training data and ambiguous or inconsistent pronunciations. In this paper, we propose a synthesis-driven multi-pronunciation contextual biasing method that performs zero-shot contextual ASR on a pretrained Whisper model. Specifically, we leverage text-to-speech (TTS) systems to synthesize diverse speech samples containing each target rare word, and then use the pretrained Whisper model to extract multiple predicted pronunciation variants. These variant token sequences are compiled into a prefix-trie, which assigns rewards to beam hypotheses in a shallow-fusion manner during beam-search decoding. Subsequently, any recognized variant is mapped back to the original rare word in the final transcription. The evaluation results on the LibriSpeech dataset show that our method reduces biased-word error rate (B-WER) by 43% on test-clean and 44% on test-other while maintaining unbiased-WER (U-WER) essentially unchanged.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaixuan Bao, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng</p>
            <p>Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing (VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing (AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60% sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared to the traditional fixed-length methods.</p>

            <p>Chance-constrained optimization has emerged as a promising framework for managing uncertainties in power systems. This work advances its application to the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) model, developing a novel approach to uncertainty modeling and estimation. Current methods typically tackle these problems by first modeling random nodal injections using high-dimensional statistical distributions that scale with the number of buses, followed by deriving deterministic reformulations of the probabilistic constraints. We propose an alternative methodology that exploits the constraint structure to inform the uncertainties to be estimated, enabling significant dimensionality reduction. Rather than learning joint distributions of net-load forecast errors across units, we instead directly model the one-dimensional aggregate system forecast error and two-dimensional line errors weighted by power transfer distribution factors. We evaluate our approach under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in statistical accuracy and optimization performance compared to existing methods.</p>

            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method -- hull clustering with blended RPs -- that enhances traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), enabling a more accurate approximation of the full time horizon with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a grid-aware probabilistic approach to compute the aggregated flexibility at the grid connection point (GCP) of active distribution networks (ADNs) to allow the participation of DERs in ancillary services (AS) markets. Specifically an optimal power flow (OPF) method using a linear network model is used to compute the aggregated capability for the provision of multiple AS. We start from the method proposed in [1] and extend it to allow for optimizing the provision of multiple services simultaneously, ensure cost-effectiveness of the used DERs and handle uncertainties in a probabilistic way. The allocation of individual DERs power flexibilities accounts for the operational costs associated to the provision of different services and ensures cost-effectiveness while maximizing the value of the advertised aggregated flexibility, assuming known service prices. Empirical uncertainty sets are obtained to achieve a predefined coverage of the probability distribution in line with recent developments in the Nordic AS markets. Finally, a feeder-decomposition approach is proposed to ensure the methods applicability to realistic distribution networks with a large number of buses. Different case studies show the effectiveness of the method, highlight the importance of accounting for network constraints and illustrate its applicability to realistic distribution systems.</p>

We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from the current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 12.9 GW, with urban hot-spots reaching 5.2 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges.

            <h2>A Framework of Arithmetic-Level Variable Precision Computing for In-Memory Architecture: Case Study in MIMO Signal Processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaixuan Bao, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng</p>
            <p>Computational complexity poses a significant challenge in wireless communication. Most existing attempts aim to reduce it through algorithm-specific approaches. However, the precision of computing, which directly relates to both computing performance and computational complexity, is a dimension that is fundamental but rarely explored in the literature. With the emerging architecture of in-memory computing, variable precision computing (VPC) is enabled, allowing each arithmetic operation to be processed with a distinct and specifically optimized computing precision. In this paper, we establish a unified framework of arithmetic-level variable precision computing (AL-VPC), which aims to determine the optimized computing precision for each arithmetic operation. We first develop an arithmetic propagation error model exploiting stochastic analysis, and then formulate a mathematical optimization problem to strike balance between computing performance and computational complexity. Two algorithms, namely, offline VPC and online VPC, are proposed to solve the problem considering various practical concerns. Particularly, in a case study on zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we reveal the Pareto boundary between computing performance and complexity, which exhibits up to a 60% sum-rate enhancement or equivalently up to a 30% complexity reduction compared to the traditional fixed-length methods.</p>

            <h2>Chance-Constrained DC Optimal Power Flow Using Constraint-Informed Statistical Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyang Yi, D. Adrian Maldonado, Anirudh Subramanyam</p>
            <p>Chance-constrained optimization has emerged as a promising framework for managing uncertainties in power systems. This work advances its application to the DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) model, developing a novel approach to uncertainty modeling and estimation. Current methods typically tackle these problems by first modeling random nodal injections using high-dimensional statistical distributions that scale with the number of buses, followed by deriving deterministic reformulations of the probabilistic constraints. We propose an alternative methodology that exploits the constraint structure to inform the uncertainties to be estimated, enabling significant dimensionality reduction. Rather than learning joint distributions of net-load forecast errors across units, we instead directly model the one-dimensional aggregate system forecast error and two-dimensional line errors weighted by power transfer distribution factors. We evaluate our approach under both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in statistical accuracy and optimization performance compared to existing methods.</p>

            <h2>Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grigory Neustroev, Diego A. Tejada-Arango, German Morales-Espana, Mathijs M. de Weerdt</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose a novel method -- hull clustering with blended RPs -- that enhances traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), enabling a more accurate approximation of the full time horizon with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Flexibility Aggregation of DERs for Ancillary Services Provision</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthieu Jacobs, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>This paper presents a grid-aware probabilistic approach to compute the aggregated flexibility at the grid connection point (GCP) of active distribution networks (ADNs) to allow the participation of DERs in ancillary services (AS) markets. Specifically an optimal power flow (OPF) method using a linear network model is used to compute the aggregated capability for the provision of multiple AS. We start from the method proposed in [1] and extend it to allow for optimizing the provision of multiple services simultaneously, ensure cost-effectiveness of the used DERs and handle uncertainties in a probabilistic way. The allocation of individual DERs power flexibilities accounts for the operational costs associated to the provision of different services and ensures cost-effectiveness while maximizing the value of the advertised aggregated flexibility, assuming known service prices. Empirical uncertainty sets are obtained to achieve a predefined coverage of the probability distribution in line with recent developments in the Nordic AS markets. Finally, a feeder-decomposition approach is proposed to ensure the methods applicability to realistic distribution networks with a large number of buses. Different case studies show the effectiveness of the method, highlight the importance of accounting for network constraints and illustrate its applicability to realistic distribution systems.</p>

            <h2>A Hierarchical Signal Coordination and Control System Using a Hybrid Model-based and Reinforcement Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianyue Peng, Shenyang Chen, H. Michael Zhang</p>
            <p>Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC); and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware, GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across all demand levels.</p>

            <h2>Missing Money and Market-Based Adequacy in Deeply Decarbonized Power Systems with Long-Duration Energy Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Suski, Elina Spyrou, Richard Green</p>
            <p>The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</p>

We (1) provide the first digital twin framework extended with scheduling capabilities, (2) integrate various top-tier HPC systems given their publicly available datasets, (3) implement extensions to integrate external scheduling simulators. Finally, we show how to (4) implement and evaluate incentive structures, as-well-as (5) evaluate machine learning based scheduling, in such novel digital-twin based meta-framework to prototype scheduling.

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Control for a Networked Battery Energy Storage System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mihitha Maithripala, Zongli Lin</p>
            <p>The increasing deployment of distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in modern power grids necessitates effective coordination strategies to ensure state-of-charge (SoC) balancing and accurate power delivery. While distributed control frameworks offer scalability and resilience, they also raise significant privacy concerns due to the need for inter-agent information exchange. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving distributed control algorithm for SoC balancing in a networked BESS. The proposed framework includes distributed power allocation law that is designed based on two privacy-preserving distributed estimators, one for the average unit state and the other for the average desired power. The average unit state estimator is designed via the state decomposition method without disclosing sensitive internal states. The proposed power allocation law based on these estimators ensures asymptotic SoC balancing and global power delivery while safeguarding agent privacy from external eavesdroppers. The effectiveness and privacy-preserving properties of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated through simulation results.</p>

            <h2>Comparison of Droop-Based Single-Loop Grid-Forming Wind Turbines: High-Frequency Open-Loop Unstable Behavior and Damping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Chen, Yufei Xi, Lin Cheng, Xiongfei Wang, Ioannis Lestas</p>
            <p>The integration of inverter-interfaced generators introduces new instability phenomena into modern power systems. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of two widely used droop-based grid-forming controls, namely droop control and droop-I control, in wind turbines. Although both approaches provide steady-state reactive power-voltage droop characteristics, their impacts on high-frequency (HF) stability differ significantly. Firstly, on open-loop (OL) comparison reveals that droop-I control alters HF pole locations. The application of Routh's Stability Criterion further analytically demonstrates that such pole shifts inevitably lead to OL instability. This HF OL instability is identified as a structural phenomenon in purely inductive grids and cannot be mitigated through control parameter tuning. As a result, droop-I control significantly degrades HF stability, making conventional gain and phase margins insufficient for evaluating robustness against parameter variations. Then, the performance of established active damping (AD) is assessed for both control schemes. The finding indicates that AD designs effective for droop control may fail to suppress HF resonance under droop-I control due to the presence of unstable OL poles. Case studies performed on the IEEE 14-Bus Test System validate the analysis and emphasize the critical role of HF OL instability in determining the overall power system stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazi Sifatul Islam, Anandi Dutta, Shivani Mruthyunjaya</p>
            <p>Electrical grids are now much more complex due to the rapid integration of distributed generation and alternative energy sources, which makes forecasting grid stability with optimized control a crucial task for operators. Traditional statistical, physics-based, and ML models can learn the pattern of the grid features, but have limitations in optimal strategy control with instability prediction. This work proposes a hybrid ML-RL framework that leverages ML for rapid stability prediction and RL for dynamic control and optimization. The first stage of this study created a baseline that explored the potential of various ML models for stability prediction. Out of them, the stacking classifiers of several fundamental models show a significant performance in classifying the instability, leading to the second stage, where reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, A2C, and DQN) optimize power control actions. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid ML-RL model effectively stabilizes the grid, achieves rapid convergence, and significantly reduces training time. The integration of ML-based stability classification with RL-based dynamic control enhances decision-making efficiency while lowering computational complexity, making it well-suited for real-time smart grid applications.</p>

            <p>This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically, we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario. To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.</p>

            <p>The electrification and automation of mobility are reshaping how cities operate on-demand transport systems. Managing Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (EAMoD) fleets effectively requires coordinating dispatch, rebalancing, and charging decisions under multiple uncertainties, including travel demand, travel time, energy consumption, and charger availability. We address this challenge with a combined stochastic and robust model predictive control (MPC) framework. The framework integrates spatio-temporal Bayesian neural network forecasts with a multi-stage stochastic optimization model, formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. To ensure real-time applicability, we develop a tailored Nested Benders Decomposition that exploits the scenario tree structure and enables efficient parallelized solution. Stochastic optimization is employed to anticipate demand and infrastructure variability, while robust constraints on energy consumption and travel times safeguard feasibility under worst-case realizations. We evaluate the framework using high-fidelity simulations of San Francisco and Chicago. Compared with deterministic, reactive, and robust baselines, the combined stochastic and robust approach reduces median passenger waiting times by up to 36% and 95th-percentile delays by nearly 20%, while also lowering rebalancing distance by 27% and electricity costs by more than 35%. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of battery size and vehicle efficiency, finding that energy-efficient vehicles maintain stable performance even with small batteries, whereas less efficient vehicles require larger batteries and greater infrastructure support. Our results emphasize the importance of jointly optimizing predictive control, vehicle capabilities, and infrastructure planning to enable scalable, cost-efficient EAMoD operations.</p>

            <p>The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium- and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized control architecture for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The system consists of a global controller (GC), and N local controllers (LCs). The GC operates at a slower timescale, imposing budget constraints on the actions of LCs, which function at a faster timescale. Applications can be found in energy grid planning, wildfire management, and other decentralized resource allocation problems. We propose and analyze two optimization frameworks for this setting: COpt and FOpt. In COpt, both GC and LCs together optimize infinite-horizon discounted rewards, while in FOpt the LCs optimize finite-horizon episodic rewards, and the GC optimizes infinite-horizon rewards. Although both frameworks share identical reward functions, their differing horizons can lead to different optimal policies. In particular, FOpt grants greater autonomy to LCs by allowing their policies to be determined only by local objectives, unlike COpt. To our knowledge, these frameworks have not been studied in the literature. We establish the formulations, prove the existence of optimal policies, and prove the convergence of their value iteration algorithms. We further show that COpt always achieves a higher value function than FOpt and derive explicit bounds on their difference. Finally, we establish a set of sufficient structural conditions under which the two frameworks become equivalent.</p>

            <p>The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.</p>

            <h2>Robust Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Cell-Free ISAC with Time Synchronization Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Xiu, Yang Zhao, Ran Yang, Wanting Lyu, Dusit Niyato, Dong In Kim, Guangyi Liu, Ning Wei</p>
            <p>The cell-free integrated sensing and communication (CF-ISAC) system, which effectively mitigates intra-cell interference and provides precise sensing accuracy, is a promising technology for future 6G networks. However, to fully capitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS) between access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current synchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in the development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel CF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial diversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce the impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the worst-case Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint optimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy communication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust optimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex problem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the worst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an MA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization variables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and transmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors. Moreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies, the proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity, thus validating its effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Towards Diagnostic Quality Flat-Panel Detector CT Imaging Using Diffusion Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hélène Corbaz, Anh Nguyen, Victor Schulze-Zachau, Paul Friedrich, Alicia Durrer, Florentin Bieder, Philippe C. Cattin, Marios N Psychogios</p>
            <p>Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts. However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT. This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans. Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the input FDCT image quality is not too low.

            <h2>Vocoder-Projected Feature Discriminator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuhiro Kaneko, Hirokazu Kameoka, Kou Tanaka, Yuto Kondo</p>
            <p>In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.</p>

            <h2>A Learning-based Hybrid System Approach for Detecting Contingencies in Distribution Grids with Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari</p>
            <p>This paper presents a machine-learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) modeling framework to detect contingencies in active distribution networks populated with inverter-based resources (IBRs). In particular, this framework allows detecting unobservable contingencies, which cannot be identified by normal sensing systems. First, a state-space SHS model combining conventional and IRB-based resources is introduced to formulate the dynamic interaction between continuous states of distribution networks and discrete contingency events. This model forms a randomly switching system, where parameters or network topology can change due to contingencies. We consider two contingency classes: (i) physical events, such as line outages, and (ii) measurement anomalies caused by sensor faults. Leveraging multivariate time series data derived from high-frequency sampling of system states and network outputs, a time series-based learning model is trained for real-time contingency detection and classification. Simulation studies, carried out on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system, demonstrate a 96% overall detection accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Fairness Shaping with LLM-Guided Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Peer-to-Peer Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrenik Jadhav, Birva Sevak, Srijita Das, Akhtar Hussain, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui</p>
            <p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid (FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability. Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient, socially equitable, and technically sound.</p>

            <h2>Globally Stable Discrete Time PID Passivity-based Control of Power Converters: Simulation and Experimental Results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Moreschini, Wei He, Romeo Ortega, Yiheng Lu, Tao Li</p>
            <p>The key idea behind PID Passivity-based Control (PID-PBC) is to leverage the passivity property of PIDs (for all positive gains) and wrap the PID controller around a passive output to ensure global stability in closed-loop. However, the practical applicability of PID-PBC is stymied by two key facts: (i) the vast majority of practical implementations of PIDs is carried-out in discrete time -- discretizing the continuous time dynamical system of the PID; (ii) the well-known problem that passivity is not preserved upon discretization, even with small sampling times. Therefore, two aspects of the PID-PBC must be revisited for its safe practical application. First, we propose a discretization of the PID that ensures its passivity. Second, since the output that is identified as passive for the continuous time system is not necessarily passive for its discrete time version, we construct a new output that ensures the passivity property for the discretization of the system. In this paper, we provide a constructive answer to both issues for the case of power converter models. Instrumental to achieve this objective is the use of the implicit midpoint discretization method -- which is a symplectic integration technique that preserves system invariants. Since the reference value for the output to be regulated in power converters is non-zero, we are henceforth interested in the property of passivity of the incremental model -- currently known as shifted passivity. Therefore, we demonstrate that the resulting discrete-time PID-PBC defines a passive map for the incremental model and establish shifted passivity for the discretized power converter model. Combining these properties, we prove global stability for the feedback interconnection of the power converter with the discretized PID-PBC. The paper also presents simulations and experiments that demonstrate the performance of the proposed discretization.</p>

            <h2>A Principled Framework to Evaluate Quality of AC-OPF Datasets for Machine Learning: Benchmarking a Novel, Scalable Generation Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Baù (1), Luca Perbellini (2), Samuele Grillo (2) ((1) Ricerca sul Sistema Energetico, (2) Politecnico di Milano)</p>
            <p>Several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the quality of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) datasets used in machine learning (ML) models. Yet, scalability to large power systems remains unaddressed and comparing generation approaches is still hindered by the absence of widely accepted metrics quantifying AC-OPF dataset quality. In this work, we tackle both these limitations. We provide a simple heuristic that samples load setpoints uniformly in total load active power, rather than maximizing volume coverage, and solves an AC-OPF formulation with load slack variables to improve convergence. For quality assessment, we formulate a multi-criteria framework based on three metrics, measuring variability in the marginal distributions of AC-OPF primal variables, diversity in constraint activation patterns among AC-OPF instances and activation frequency of variable bounds. By comparing four open-source methods based on these metrics, we show that our heuristic consistently outperforms uniform random sampling, whether independent or constrained to a convex polytope, scoring as best in terms of balance between dataset quality and scalability.</p>

            <h2>Learning Interior Point Method for AC and DC Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian, Ramachandran Vaidyanathan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a feasibility-guaranteed learning interior point method (L-IPM) to solve both AC and DC optimal power flow (OPF) problems. Given the criticality of OPF, the proposed L-IPM uses a hybrid learning model approach rather than relying solely on a simple black-box prediction. The traditional IPM follows a central path from an initial point to the optimal solution. However, each iteration involves solving large linear systems, which becomes increasingly expensive as the matrices grow more ill-conditioned in later steps. To address this, we model the IPM trajectory as a time series and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to project the IPM central path using only the first few stable iterations, which carry the most informative features about the path to optimality. We introduce a grid-informed methodology that enforces operational constraints on generation, voltage magnitudes, and line flows to ensure feasibility. The grid-informed LSTM serves as a tool for the IPM central path projection and, followed by a final IPM refinement step, significantly reduces the total number of iterations and time required for convergence. We use a sampling method to generate a wide range of load scenarios to improve generalization across diverse operating conditions, efficiently covering the power system's operational space. Simulation results on a 2869-bus European high-voltage transmission system show that the proposed L-IPM significantly reduces solution time by up to 94\%, while maintaining accuracy and feasibility of the solution. By leveraging early iterations and bypassing the final ill-conditioned and computationally demanding steps of traditional IPM, the proposed L-IPM reduces the number of required iterations by up to 85.5\%. Since solution feasibility is also guaranteed, L-IPM outperforms the conventional IPM in both computational efficiency and robustness.</p>

            <h2>ZTFed-MAS2S: A Zero-Trust Federated Learning Framework with Verifiable Privacy and Trust-Aware Aggregation for Wind Power Data Imputation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Hanjie Wang, Yuanzheng Li, Jiazheng Li, Zhaoyang Dong</p>
            <p>Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange. These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in the energy sector.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Planning for Enhancing the Resilience of Modern Distribution Systems Against Cyberattacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armita Khashayardoost, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Deepa Kundur</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of IoT-connected devices in smart grids has introduced new vulnerabilities at the distribution level. Of particular concern is the potential for cyberattacks that exploit high-wattage IoT devices, such as EV chargers, to manipulate local demand and destabilize the grid. While previous studies have primarily focused on such attacks at the transmission level, this paper investigates their feasibility and impact at the distribution level. We examine how cyberattackers can target voltage-sensitive nodes, especially those exposed by the presence of high-consumption devices, to cause voltage deviation and service disruption. Our analysis demonstrates that conventional grid protections are insufficient against these intelligent, localized attacks. To address this, we propose resilience strategies using distributed generation (DGs), exploring their role in preemptive planning. This research highlights the urgent need for distribution-level cyber resilience planning in smart grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Schaurecker, David Wozabal, Nils Löhndorf, Thorsten Staake</p>
            <p>Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</p>

            <p>The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the convergence of transport electrification, creates a significant challenge for distribution network management e.g. voltage and frequency violations, particularly in rural and remote areas. This paper investigates how smart charging of electric vehicles (EVs) can help reduce renewable energy curtailment and alleviate stress on local distribution networks. We implement a customised AC Optimal Power Flow (AC OPF) formulation which integrates into the optimisation an indicator reflecting the social impact of flexibility from EV users, based on the analysis of historical EV charging behaviours. The contribution of EV owners to reducing wind curtailment is optimised to enhance the acceptability of flexibility procurement, as the method targets EV users whose charging habits are most likely to align with flexibility requirements. Our method integrates social, technological, and economic perspectives with optimal flexibility coordination, and utilises clustering of EVs through a kmeans algorithm. To ensure scalability, we introduce a polar coordinate-based dimension reduction technique. The flexibility optimisation approach is demonstrated on the Orkney grid model, incorporating demand and wind farm generation data, as well as multi year charging data from 106 EVs. Results indicate that, by building upon the existing habits of EV users, curtailment can be reduced by 99.5% during a typical summer week the period when curtailment is most prevalent. This research demonstrates a foundational and transferable approach which is cognisant of socio techno economic factors towards accelerating decarbonisation and tackling the stochastic challenges of new demand and generation patterns on local distribution networks.</p>

            <p>The integration of distributed generation (DG) is essential to the energy transition but poses challenges for lowvoltage (LV) distribution networks (DNs) with limited hosting capacity (HC). This study incorporates multiple fairness criteria, utilitarian, egalitarian, bounded, and bargaining, into the HC optimisation framework to assess their impact. When applied to LV feeders of different sizes and topologies, the analysis shows that bargaining and upper-bounded fairness provide the best balance between efficiency and fairness. Efficiency refers to maximising the social welfare of the LV DNs, while fairness is proportional to the minimisation of disparity in opportunity for installing DG. Feeder topology significantly influences fairness outcomes, while feeder size affects total HC and the inherent fairness of feeders. These results emphasise the importance of regulatory incentives and network designs in order to facilitate fair and efficient DG integration.</p>

            <p>Forced Oscillations (FO) stemming from external periodic disturbances threaten power system security and stability. The increasing penetration of Inverter-Based Resources(IBRs) further introduces FO, leading to new challenges in identifying and locating FO sources in modern power systems. In this paper, a novel data-driven method for locating FO in power systems with IBRs is proposed. Unlike previous works, a unified representation of FO originating from IBRs is considered, which further facilitates the development of the FO locating algorithm. Leveraging on Sparse Identification for a Nonlinear Dynamical (SINDy), a purely data-driven methodology is developed for locating the source of FO by interpreting the proposed model from measurements. Numerical results on the WECC 240-bus system validate the performance of the proposed approach in successfully locating FO in the presence of IBRs.</p>

            <p>Developing a unified small-signal model for modern, large-scale power systems that remains accurate across a wide range of operating ranges presents a formidable challenge. Traditional methods, spanning mechanistic modeling, modal identification, and deep learning, have yet to fully overcome persistent limitations in accuracy, universal applicability, and interpretability. In this paper, a novel hierarchical neural state-space equation approach is proposed to overcome these obstacles, achieving strong representation, high interpretability, and superior adaptability to both system scale and varying operating points. Specifically, we first introduce neural state-space equations integrated with virtual state observers to accurately characterize the dynamics of power system devices, even in the presence of unmeasurable states. Subsequently, a hierarchical architecture is designed to handle the modeling complexity across a wide range of operating conditions, flexibly decoupling device and grid models to effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Finally, a set of spatiotemporal data transformations and a multi-stage training strategy with a multi-objective loss function is employed to enhance the models efficiency and generalization. Numerical results on the two-machine three-bus system and the Guangdong Power Grid verify the superior performance of the proposed method, presenting it as a powerful new tool for small-signal stability analysis.</p>

            <p>Due to the rapid pace of electrification and decarbonization, distribution grid (DG) operation and planning are becoming more complex, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure grid reliability and resilience. State-of-the-art DG analyses rely on disparate workflows of complex models, functions, and data pipelines, which require expert knowledge and are challenging to automate. Many small-scale utilities and cooperatives lack a large R&D workforce and therefore cannot use advanced analysis at scale. To address this gap, we develop a novel agentic AI system, PowerChain, to solve unseen DG analysis tasks via automated agentic orchestration and large language models (LLMs) function-calling. Given a natural language query, PowerChain dynamically generates and executes an ordered sequence of domain-aware functions guided by the semantics of an expert-built power systems function pool and a select reference set of known, expert-generated workflow-query pairs. Our results show that PowerChain can produce expert-level workflows with both GPT-5 and open-source Qwen models on complex, unseen DG analysis tasks operating on real utility data.</p>

            <p>We study how high charging rate demands from electric vehicles (EVs) in a power distribution grid may collectively cause poor dynamic performance, and propose a price incentivization strategy to steer customers to settle for lesser charging rate demands so that such performance degradation can be avoided. We pose the problem as a joint optimization and optimal control formulation. The optimization determines the optimal charging setpoints for EVs to minimize the $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm of the transfer function of the grid model, while the optimal control simultaneously develops a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based state-feedback control signal for the battery currents of those EVs to jointly improve the small-signal dynamic performance of the system states. A subsequent algorithm is developed to determine how much customers may be willing to sacrifice their intended charging rate demands in return for financial incentives. Results are derived for both unidirectional and bidirectional charging, and validated using numerical simulations of multiple EV charging stations (EVCSs) in the IEEE 33-bus power distribution model.</p>

            <p>Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. While for known environments, offline methods can find provably complete paths, and in some cases optimal solutions, unknown environments need to be planned online during mapping. We investigate the suitability of continuous-space reinforcement learning (RL) for this challenging problem, and propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers, as well as a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Compared to existing classical methods, this approach allows for a flexible path space, and enables the agent to adapt to specific environment characteristics. Meanwhile, the deployment of RL models on real robot systems is difficult. Training from scratch may be infeasible due to slow convergence times, while transferring from simulation to reality, i.e. sim-to-real transfer, is a key challenge in itself. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through a semi-virtual environment, including a real robot and real-time aspects, while utilizing a simulated sensor and obstacles to enable environment randomization and automated episode resetting. We investigate what level of fine-tuning is needed for adapting to a realistic setting. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP variations in simulation. Meanwhile, our method successfully transfers to a real robot. Our code implementation can be found online.</p>

            <p>We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant, this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d. random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components, representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics. We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of participating clients increases.</p>

            <p>To increase the efficiency of future electric vehicles, it is crucial to reduce drivetrain losses in battery-powered vehicles. This enables either an increase in driving range or overall cost savings by reducing battery capacity while maintaining the same range. Harmonic motor losses account for an avoidable share of more than 30% of the total eDrive losses in standard B6-2L 300 kW iPMSM configurations. These losses result from high-frequency voltage distortion across the motor windings, which can be reduced through various approaches. Of great importance is the classification of cost-neutral and low-cost concepts for loss reduction. The following presents and categorizes approaches to loss reduction that have been developed by research and industry in recent years. In particular, novel part-load-capable motor and inverter concepts are introduced, which enable motor switching or multilevel operation to reduce harmonic losses in the part-load range.</p>

            <h2>Solving Three-phase AC Infeasibility Analysis to Near-zero Optimality Gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bikram Panthee, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Recent works have shown the use of equivalent circuit-based infeasibility analysis to identify weak locations in distribution power grids. For three-phase power flow problems, when the power flow solver diverges, three-phase infeasibility analysis (TPIA) can converge and identify weak locations. The original TPIA problem is non-convex, and local minima and saddle points are possible. This can result in grid upgrades that are sub-optimal. To address this issue, we reformulate the original non-convex nonlinear program (NLP) as an exact non-convex bilinear program (BLP). Subsequently, we apply the spatial branch-and-bound (SBnB) algorithm to compute a solution with near-zero optimality gap. To improve SBnB performance, we introduce a bound tightening algorithm with variable filtering and decomposition, which tightens bounds on bilinear variables. We demonstrate that sequential bound tightening (SBT) significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of Gurobi's SBnB algorithm. Our results show that the proposed method can solve large-scale three-phase infeasibility analysis problems with >5k nodes, achieving an optimality gap of less than 10e-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing the developed presolve routine for bounding, we can reduce the runtime of SBnB by up to 97%.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven Analysis and Predictive Control of Descriptor Systems with Application to Power and Water Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Zhang, Yu Wang, Jun Shang, Jinhui Zhang</p>
            <p>Despite growing interest in data-driven analysis and control of linear systems, descriptor systems--which are essential for modeling complex engineered systems with algebraic constraints like power and water networks--have received comparatively little attention. This paper develops a comprehensive data-driven framework for analyzing and controlling discrete-time descriptor systems without relying on explicit state-space models. We address fundamental challenges posed by non-causality through the construction of forward and backward data matrices, establishing data-based sufficient conditions for controllability and observability in terms of input-output data, where both R-controllability and C-controllability (R-observability and C-observability) have been considered. We then extend Willems' fundamental lemma to incompletely controllable systems. These methodological advances enable Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) to achieve output tracking in descriptor systems and to maintain performance under incomplete controllability conditions, as demonstrated in two case studies: i) Frequency regulation in an IEEE 9-bus power system with 3 generators, where DeePC maintained the frequency stability of the power system despite deliberate violations of R-controllability; and ii) Pressure head control in an EPANET water network with 3 tanks, 2 reservoirs, and 117 pipes, where output tracking was successfully enforced under algebraic constraints.</p>

            <h2>Wide-Area Power System Oscillations from Large-Scale AI Workloads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper develops a new dynamic power profiling approach for modeling AI-centric datacenter loads and analyzing their impact on grid operations, particularly their potential to induce wide-area grid oscillations. We characterize the periodic stochastic power fluctuations inherent to large-scale AI workloads during both the training and fine-tuning stages, driven by the state-of-the-art GPU computing architecture designs. These sustained, large power fluctuations, unlike conventional load ramping, act as persistent forcing inputs capable of interacting with and amplifying local and inter-area oscillation modes. Using the WECC 179-bus system as a test case, we examine the amplitude and variability of oscillatory responses under different factors, ranging from system strength, penetration level, fluctuation frequency range, individual datacenter size, to geographical deployment. Simulation results show that, notably, narrower fluctuation bands, larger single-site capacities, or dispersed siting can intensify oscillations across multiple modes. Our models and numerical studies provide a quantitative basis for integrating AI-dominant electricity demands into grid oscillation studies, and further support the development of new planning and operational measures to power the continuous AI load growth.</p>

            <h2>IDSO-Managed Bid-Based Transactive Distribution Systems Design for DER Participation in Wholesale Markets While Preserving T-D Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swastik Sharma, Swathi Battula, Sri Niwas Singh</p>
            <p>Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in bid-based Transactive Energy Systems (TES) at the distribution systems facilitates strongly coupled, bidirectional interactions between Transmission-Distribution (T-D) systems. Capturing these interactions is critical for ensuring seamless integration within an Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) framework. This study proposes a methodology to preserve such tight T-D linkages by developing an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) managed bid-based TES design for unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed design operates within the ITD paradigm and permits DER participation in the Wholesale Power Market (WPM) through IDSO while preserving tight T-D linkages. To this end, this research offers the following key contributions: a novel bid/offer prequalification-cum-aggregation method to ensure a grid-safe and value-based aggregation of DERs' bids and offers for WPM participation through IDSO; and a retail pricing mechanism that reflects the true value of procuring or offering additional units of power within the distribution system. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 123-bus radial feeder populated with a high DER concentration to validate the proposed frameworks' effectiveness in coordinating the DERs efficiently and reliably.</p>

            <p>Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise' classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Structure-preserving Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Radial Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omid Mokhtari, Samuel Chevalier, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Network reduction simplifies complex electrical networks to address computational challenges of large-scale transmission and distribution grids. Traditional network reduction methods are often based on a predefined set of nodes or lines to remain in the reduced network. This paper builds upon previous work on Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON), which was formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), to enhance the framework in two aspects. First, the scalability is improved via a cutting plane restriction, tightened Big~M bounds, and a zero-injection node reduction stage. Next, we introduce a radiality-preservation step to identify and recover nodes whose restoration ensures radiality of the reduced network. The model is validated through its application to the 533-bus distribution test system and a 3499-bus realistic test feeder for a set of representative loading scenarios. In the 533-bus system, an 85% reduction was achieved with a maximum voltage error below 0.0025 p.u., while in the 3499-bus feeder, over 94% reduction was obtained with maximum voltage errors below 0.002 p.u. Additionally, we show that the radialization step accelerates the runtime of optimal voltage control problems when applied to Kron-reduced networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ravi Raj Shrestha, Zhi Zhou, Limon Barua, Nazib Siddique, Karthikeyan Balasubramaniam, Yan Zhou, Lusha Wang</p>
            <p>The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a critical evaluation of existing power distribution infrastructures, as EV integration imposes additional stress on distribution networks that can lead to component overloading and power quality degradation. Implementing smart charging mechanisms can mitigate these adverse effects and defer or even avoid upgrades. This study assesses the performance of two smart charging strategies - Time of Use (TOU) pricing and Load Balancing (LB) on seven representative real-world feeders identified using k-means clustering. A time series-based steady-state load flow analysis was conducted on these feeders to simulate the impact of EV charging under both strategies across four different EV enrollment scenarios and three representative days to capture seasonal load characteristics. A grid upgrade strategy has been proposed to strengthen the power grid to support EV integration with minimal cost. Results demonstrate that both TOU and LB strategies effectively manage the additional EV load with reduced upgrade requirement and cost to existing infrastructure compared to the case without smart charging strategies and LB outperforms TOU when the customer enrollment levels are high. These findings support the viability of smart charging in facilitating EV integration while maintaining distribution network reliability and reducing investment cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philip Bilfinger, Markus Schreiber, Philipp Rosner, Kareem Abo Gamra, Jan Schöberl, Cristina Grosu, Markus Lienkamp</p>
            <p>Range and performance are key customer-relevant properties of electric vehicles. Both degrade over time due to battery aging, thus impacting business decisions throughout a vehicle's lifecycle, such as efficient utilization and asset valuation. For practical assessment, aging is often simplified into a single figure of merit - the state of health - typically defined by the battery pack's remaining capacity or energy. However, no standardized method for measuring the state of health at the vehicle level has been established, leaving both academia and industry without a clear consensus. Ultimately, standardization is crucial to increase transparency and build confidence in the long-term reliability of electric vehicles' battery packs. In this article, we propose a standard measurement procedure for assessing the capacity- and energy-based state of health, leveraging onboard charging to enable reproducibility and scalability. Additionally, we demonstrate how differential voltage analysis can provide deeper insights into battery aging at the vehicle level.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.</p>

            <p>Traditional monofacial photovoltaic (mPV) systems are commonly adopted and well-documented because of their lower upfront costs in comparison to bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) systems. This study investigates how PV technologies impact energy storage in grid-scale hybrid renewable systems, focusing on optimizing and assessing the performance of mPV and bPV technologies integrated with pumped storage hydropower. Using Ludington City, Michigan as a case study and analyzing realworld data such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and utility-scale load profiles, the research highlights the operational and economic benefits of bPV systems. The results reveal that bPV systems can pump approximately 10.38% more water annually to the upper reservoir while achieving a lower levelized cost of energy ($0.0578/kWh for bPV vs. $0.0672/kWh for mPV). This study underscores the outstanding potential of bPV systems in enhancing energy storage and management strategies, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient renewable energy future.</p>

            <h2>Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis David Pabon Ospina</p>
            <p>Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</p>

            <h2>A Digital Twin-Based Simulation Framework for Safe Curve Speed Estimation Using Unity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Araf Rahman (1), M. Sabbir Salek (1), Mashrur Chowdhury (1), Wayne A. Sarasua (1) ((1) Clemson University)</p>
            <p>Horizontal curves are often associated with roadway crashes due to speed misjudgment and loss of control. With the growing adoption of autonomous and connected vehicles, the accurate estimation of safe speed at curves is becoming increasingly important. The widely used AASHTO design method for safe curve speed estimation relies on an analytical equation based on a simplified point mass model, which often uses conservative parameters to account for vehicular and environmental variations. This paper presents a digital twin-based framework for estimating safe speed at curves using a physics-driven virtual environment developed in the Unity engine. In this framework, a real-world horizontal road curve is selected, and vehicle speed data are collected using a radar gun under various weather conditions. A 3D model of the road curve is constructed in a Unity environment using roadway geometric and elevation data. A parameterized vehicle model is integrated, allowing for variations in mass, acceleration, and center of gravity to reflect different vehicle types and loading scenarios. This simulation identifies the maximum safe speed at which a vehicle can traverse the given curve, providing a more vehicle and environment-specific estimate of the safe operating speed. The study validated that the safe curve speed estimates generated by the simulation were consistent with the real-world speed values observed at a curve. This study demonstrates how a physics-based digital twin can estimate a safer and more adaptive operating speed for vehicles traversing horizontal curves.</p>

            <p>Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have advanced significantly during the past decade, yet drivetrain energy losses continue to restrict practical range and elevate cost. A dataset comprising more than 1000 European-market BEVs (model years 2010-2025) is combined with detailed inverter-motor co-simulation to chart technology progress for and quantify the efficiency and cost-saving potential of partial-load optimised multi-level inverter (MLI) for 2030. Average drive-cycle range has climbed from 135 km to 455 km, while fleet-average energy consumption has remained virtually constant. Three inverter topologies are assessed to evaluate future efficiency and cost enhancements: a conventional two-level (2L) six halfbridge (B6) inverter with silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) devices, and two three-level (3L) T-type neutral point clamped (TNPC) and active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverters tailored for partial-load operation. The 3L-TNPC inverter, realised with only 30% additional SiC chip area, lowers drive-cycle drivetrain losses by 0.67 kWh/100 km relative to a SiC 2L-B6 baseline. These results identify partial-load optimised MLIs as a cost-effective route to further reduce BEV energy consumption and total system cost.</p>

            <p>This review analysis presents a comprehensive exploration of energy flexibility in modern power systems. It examines the roles and mechanisms of flexible technologies across three main categories: generators, energy storage systems (ESS), and loads. Energy flexibility is defined as the ability to dynamically adjust supply and/or demand in response to grid conditions to maintain balance and stability. This is of particular importance to facilitate the integration of the growing variable renewable energy sources (RES) into modern power grids. Additionally, traditional supply-side mechanisms to maintain balance and stability are complemented by advancements in demand-side management and demand response strategies, which enable loads to adjust consumption patterns and schedules in response to grid requirements. ESS are also explored to further enhance flexibility by absorbing excess generation and/or supplying large load increases that are not able to be met by the less flexible resources. This paper also explores specific flexibility technologies, examining their characteristics, control strategies, advantages, and limitations. Energy flexibility services are also categorized into intermittency mitigation, peak shaving, and energy reserve provisioning. Each service is supported by case studies and examples demonstrating how different resources respond to varying conditions. Ultimately, the findings and reviews of the various flexible resources in this paper provide a roadmap for optimizing energy flexibility across diverse resource types, paving the way for a more sustainable and resilient energy future.</p>

            <p>Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset, often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline, moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS), if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models, we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Bai, Salish Maharjan, Han Wang, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Extended outages in distributed systems (DSs) dominated by distributed energy resources (DERs) require innovative strategies to efficiently and securely deploy black start (BS) resources. To address the need, this paper proposes a two-stage stochastic resource allocation method within synchronizing dynamic microgrids (MGs) for black start (SDMG-BS), enabling risk-averse and adaptive restoration across various scenarios while ensuring frequency security. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG)-controlled grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) equipped with primary frequency governors (PFGs) are modeled as BS resources. Their frequency response is characterized by three transient indices, which are deployed as frequency dynamic constraints on load pick-up events to ensure frequency stability during the BS process. SDMG-BS framework facilitates location-independent synchronization among restored MGs and with the transmission grid (TG) with the help of smart switches (SSWs). The model incorporates scenario-based stochastic programming to address multi-source uncertainties, including season-dependent operational conditions and unpredictable TG outage durations, ensuring a resilient allocation plan. The proposed approach is validated on a modified IEEE 123-node feeder with three study cases designed across sixteen uncertainty scenarios.</p>

            <p>With the increased penetration of renewable energy and reduced proportion of synchronous generators, the low-inertia characteristics of todays power system become prominent, and the transient stability issue of grid following converter (GFLC) under low inertia system (LIS) condition becomes critical. There are two prominent problems in the transient stability analysis of GFLC-LIS. The angular dynamic of LIS increases the complexity of transient stability analysis, and the nonlinear, possibly negative damping of GFLC makes it difficult to guarantee the conservative of the traditional methods. These problems make the traditional methods inapplicable. In this paper, the transient stability analysis of GFLC LIS is investigated to provide an accurate estimation of the attraction boundary and critical clearance time (CCT). Firstly, a dynamic model of GFLC-LIS is constructed, considering the phase-locked loop (PLL)-based GFLC dynamics and swing equation-based LIS dynamics. The frequency mutation of PLL at fault occurrence and clearing time is also considered. Secondly, a Zubov based transient stability analysis method is proposed, which can construct the energy function in a way that is different from the traditional conservation of energy perspective and can address the negative damping issue. Moreover, the accuracy of the CCT estimation is analyzed, and the influences of LIS parameters on transient stability are illustrated. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method</p>

            <p>The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents sustainability challenges such as increased maintenance requirements and overall higher energy consumption. This motivates self-sustainable IoT ecosystems based on Energy Harvesting (EH). This paper treats IoT deployments in which IoT devices (IoTDs) rely solely on EH to sense and transmit information about events/alarms to a base station (BS). The objective is to effectively manage the duty cycling of the IoTDs to prolong battery life and maximize the relevant data sent to the BS. The BS can also wake up specific IoTDs if extra information about an event is needed upon initial detection. We propose a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based duty cycling management to optimize energy efficiency and detection accuracy by considering spatial correlations among IoTDs' activity and their EH process. We evaluate machine learning approaches, including reinforcement learning (RL) and decision transformers (DT), to maximize information captured from events while managing energy consumption. Significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art approaches are obtained in terms of energy saving by all three proposals, KNN, RL, and DT. Moreover, the RL-based solution approaches the performance of a genie-aided benchmark as the number of IoTDs increases.</p>

However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.</p>

            <h2>Exposing Barriers to Flexibility Aggregation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Churkin, Wangwei Kong, Pierluigi Mancarella, Eduardo A. Martínez Ceseña</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DER) offers new opportunities for distribution system operators (DSO) to improve network operation through flexibility services. To utilise flexible resources, various DER flexibility aggregation methods have been proposed, such as the concept of aggregated P-Q flexibility areas. Yet, many existing studies assume perfect coordination among DER and rely on single-phase power flow analysis, thus overlooking barriers to flexibility aggregation in real unbalanced systems. To quantify the impact of these barriers, this paper proposes a three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) framework for P-Q flexibility assessment, implemented as an open-source Julia tool this http URL. The framework explicitly accounts for voltage unbalance and imperfect coordination among DER in low voltage (LV) distribution networks. Simulations on an illustrative 5-bus system and a real 221-bus LV network in the UK reveal that over 30% of the theoretical aggregated flexibility potential can be lost due to phase unbalance and lack of coordination across phases. These findings highlight the need for improved flexibility aggregation tools applicable to real unbalanced distribution networks.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enea Figini, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</p>

            <h2>Dual-Head Physics-Informed Graph Decision Transformer for Distribution System Restoration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Zhao, Jin Wei-Kocsis, Adel Heidari Akhijahani, Karen L Butler-Purry</p>
            <p>Driven by recent advances in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technologies have shown great potential for addressing distribution system restoration (DSR) under uncertainty. However, their data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit their ability to handle scenarios that require long-term temporal dependencies or few-shot and zero-shot decision making. Emerging Decision Transformers (DTs), which leverage causal transformers for sequence modeling in DRL tasks, offer a promising alternative. However, their reliance on return-to-go (RTG) cloning and limited generalization capacity restricts their effectiveness in dynamic power system environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Dual-Head Physics-informed Graph Decision Transformer (DH-PGDT) that integrates physical modeling, structural reasoning, and subgoal-based guidance to enable scalable and robust DSR even in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. DH-PGDT features a dual-head physics-informed causal transformer architecture comprising Guidance Head, which generates subgoal representations, and Action Head, which uses these subgoals to generate actions independently of RTG. It also incorporates an operational constraint-aware graph reasoning module that encodes power system topology and operational constraints to generate a confidence-weighted action vector for refining DT trajectories. This design effectively improves generalization and enables robust adaptation to unseen scenarios. While this work focuses on DSR, the underlying computing model of the proposed PGDT is broadly applicable to sequential decision making across various power system operations and other complex engineering domains.</p>

            <h2>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duc Thien Hua, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou</p>
            <p>We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output (CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</p>

            <p>The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\% average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable, and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a batteryless manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahra Mohammadi, Parnian Fazel, Siamak Mohammadi</p>
            <p>Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light, and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1) a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.</p>

            <p>The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches train routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical safety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service disruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary interruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work relies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal. This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing, but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM movement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only one input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to classify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving >99.99\% precision, <0.01\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our methodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on several electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench environments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a clear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence layer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359 standard.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and accurate solution of wind-integrated optimal power flow based on enhanced second-order cone relaxation with rolling cutting plane technique</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaojun Ruan, Botao Gao, Libao Shi</p>
            <p>The integration of large-scale renewable energy sources, such as wind power, poses significant challenges for the optimal operation of power systems owing to their inherent uncertainties. This paper proposes a solution framework for wind-integrated optimal power flow (OPF) that leverages an enhanced second-order cone relaxation (SOCR), supported by a rolling cutting plane technique. Initially, the wind generation cost, arising from discrepancies between scheduled and actual wind power outputs, is meticulously modeled using a Gaussian mixture model based on historical wind power data. This modelled wind generation cost is subsequently incorporated into the objective function of the conventional OPF problem. To achieve the efficient and accurate solution for the wind-integrated OPF, effectively managing the constraints associated with AC power flow equations is essential. In this regard, a SOCR, combined with a second-order Taylor series expansion, is employed to facilitate the convex approximation of the AC power flow equations. Additionally, a warm-start strategy, grounded in a proposed rolling cutting plane technique, is devised to reduce relaxation errors and enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution framework are demonstrated across various case studies. Specifically, the influence of wind power cost is also examined, further highlighting the practical implications of the proposed solution framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Ehsan Ahmadi, Elnaz Kabir, Mohammad Fattahi, Mousa Marzband, Dongjun Li</p>
            <p>The ongoing energy transition is significantly increasing the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems; however, their intermittency and variability pose substantial challenges, including load shedding and system congestion. This study examines the role of the battery storage system (BSS) in mitigating these challenges by balancing power supply and demand. We optimize the location, size, and type of batteries using a two-stage stochastic program, with the second stage involving hourly operational decisions over an entire year. Unlike previous research, we incorporate the comprehensive technical and economic characteristics of battery technologies. The New York State (NYS) power system, currently undergoing a significant shift towards increased RES generation, serves as our case study. Using available load and weather data from 1980-2019, we account for the uncertainty of both load and RES generation through a sample average approximation approach. Our findings indicate that BSS can reduce renewable curtailment by 34% and load shedding by 21%, contributing to a more resilient power system in achieving NYS 2030 energy targets. Furthermore, the cost of employing BSS for the reduction of load shedding and RES curtailment does not increase linearly with additional capacity, revealing a complex relationship between costs and renewable penetration. This study provides valuable insights for the strategic BSS deployment to achieve a cost-effective and reliable power system in the energy transition as well as the feasibility of the NYS 2030 energy targets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agostino Capponi, Garud Iyengar, Bo Yang, Daniel Bienstock</p>
            <p>In the Day-Ahead (DA) market, suppliers sell and load-serving entities (LSEs) purchase energy commitments, with both sides adjusting for imbalances between contracted and actual deliveries in the Real-Time (RT) market. We develop a supply function equilibrium model to study how virtual trading-speculating on DA-RT price spreads without physical delivery-affects market efficiency. Without virtual trading, LSEs underbid relative to actual demand in the DA market, pushing DA prices below expected RT prices. Virtual trading narrows, and in the limit of large number traders can eliminates, this price gap. However, it does not induce quantity alignment: DA-cleared demand remains below true expected demand, as price alignment makes the LSE indifferent between markets and prompts it to reduce DA bids to avoid over-purchasing. Renewable energy suppliers cannot offset these strategic distortions. We provide empirical support to our main model implications using data from the California and New York Independent System Operators.</p>

            <h2>Sufficient A Priori Conditions for the Linear Relaxation of the Energy Storage Scheduling Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eléa Prat, Richard Martin Lusby, Pierre Pinson</p>
            <p>When modeling energy storage systems, an essential question is how to account for the physical infeasibility of simultaneous charge and discharge. The use of complementarity constraints or of binary variables is common, but these formulations do not scale well. Alternatively, assumptions such as perfect efficiencies or positive prices are often used to justify the choice of a linear model. In this paper, we establish new a priori conditions that guarantee the existence of an optimal solution without simultaneous charge and discharge when solving the linear relaxation of the storage scheduling problem. They are based on the characteristics of the storage system, in particular, the duration of charge. They can be valid for negative prices and with inefficiencies, thereby enlarging the set of conditions for which the complementarity constraints can be relaxed. We prove mathematically the validity of these conditions and illustrate them with practical examples. We also introduce a refined mixed-integer linear equivalent, in which the number of binary variables can be drastically reduced.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Xia, Yao Sun, Haijian Sun, Rose Qingyang Hu, Dusit Niyato, Muhammad Ali Imran</p>
            <p>Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantic-value/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Nanpeng Yu</p>
            <p>Two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problems have been widely adopted to manage the uncertainties introduced by high penetrations of intermittent renewable energy resources. While decomposition-based algorithms such as column-and-constraint generation has been proposed to solve these problems, they remain computationally prohibitive for large-scale, real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a Neural Column-and-Constraint Generation (Neural CCG) method to significantly accelerate the solution of 2S-SUC problems. The proposed approach integrates a neural network that approximates the second-stage recourse problem by learning from high-level features of operational scenarios and the first-stage commitment decisions. This neural estimator is embedded within the CCG framework, replacing repeated subproblem solving with rapid neural evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the IEEE 118-bus system. Compared to the original CCG and a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Neural CCG achieves up to 130.1$\times$ speedup while maintaining a mean optimality gap below 0.096\%, demonstrating its strong potential for scalable stochastic optimization in power system.</p>

            <p>Anticipated rapid growth of large digital load, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, is poised to increase uncertainty and large fluctuations in consumption, threatening the stability, reliability, and security of the energy infrastructure. Conventional measures taken by grid planners and operators to ensure stable and reliable integration of new resources are either cost-prohibitive (e.g., transmission upgrades) or ill-equipped (e.g., generation control) to resolve the unique challenges brought on by AI Data Centers (e.g., extreme load transients). In this work, we explore the feasibility of coordinating and managing available flexibility in the grid, in terms of grid-forming storage units, to ensure stable and reliable integration of AI Data Centers without the need for costly grid upgrades. Recently developed bi-layered coordinated control strategies -- involving fast-acting, local, autonomous, control at the storage to maintain transient safety in voltage and frequency at the point-of-interconnection, and a slower, coordinated (consensus) control to restore normal operating condition in the grid -- are used in the case studies. A comparison is drawn between broadly two scenarios: a network of coordinated, smaller, distributed storage vs. larger storage installations collocated with large digital loads. IEEE 68-bus network is used for the case studies, with large digital load profiles drawn from the MIT Supercloud Dataset.</p>

            <p>In response to the inertia decline caused by high penetration of renewable generation, traditional synchronization criteria that rely solely on frequency consistency are increasingly inadequate for characterizing the coupled behavior of frequency and voltage dynamics during power-system transients. This paper focuses on the theory of complex-frequency synchronization and develops a theory-simulation analysis framework that offers a new perspective for steady-state and transient analysis of low-inertia power systems. First, the fundamental concepts and theoretical foundations of complex-frequency synchronization are presented in detail. Second, local and global dynamic synchronization criteria are derived and the concept of generalized inertia is introduced, which unifies the conventional inertial support to frequency with the inertia-like support of voltage, thereby providing an accurate measure of region-level coupled support strength for voltage and frequency. Finally, numerical case studies on the IEEE 9-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical methods and criteria, and demonstrate a visualization workflow for key indicators such as disturbance impact zones and generalized-inertia regions.</p>

            <p>Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%.

            <p>With the continuous increase in the penetration of renewable energy in the emerging power systems, the pressure on system peak regulation has been significantly intensified. Against this backdrop, demand side resources particularly air conditioning loads have garnered considerable attention for their substantial regulation potential and fast response capabilities, making them promising candidates for providing auxiliary peak shaving services. This study focuses on fixed frequency air conditioners (FFACs) and proposes an optimization model and solution method for their participation in demand response (DR) programs. First, a probabilistic response model for FFACs is developed based on the Markov assumption. Second, by sampling this probabilistic model, the aggregate power consumption of an FFAC cluster under decentralized control is obtained. Subsequently, a robust optimization model is formulated to maximize the profit of an aggregator managing the FFAC cluster during DR events, taking into account the aggregated response power. The model explicitly considers temperature uncertainty to ensure user comfort in a robust sense. Finally, leveraging the structure of the proposed model, it is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved using a commercial optimization solver. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinhua He, Zechun Hu</p>
            <p>Offshore wind power (OWP) exhibits significant fluctuations under typhoon conditions, posing substantial challenges to the secure operation of power systems. Accurate forecasting of OWP is therefore essential. However, the inherent scarcity of historical typhoon data and stochasticity of OWP render traditional point forecasting methods particularly difficult and inadequate. To address this challenge and provide grid operators with the comprehensive information necessary for decision-making, this study proposes a score-based conditional diffusion model (SCDM) for probabilistic forecasting of OWP during typhoon events. First, a knowledge graph algorithm is employed to embed historical typhoon paths as vectors. Then, a deterministic network is constructed to predict the wind power under typhoon conditions based on these vector embeddings. Finally, to better characterize prediction errors, a denoising network is developed. At the core of this approach is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE), which transforms complex error distributions into a standard Gaussian, enabling the sampling of forecasting errors using a reverse-time SDE. The probabilistic forecasting results are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts with sampled errors. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world data from a cluster of 9 offshore wind farms. Results demonstrate that under typhoon conditions, our approach outperforms baseline models for both deterministic and probabilistic metrics, verifying the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

Owing to the comparatively less stringent security controls and widespread availability of HANs, attackers view them as an attractive entry point to manipulate aggregated demand patterns, which can ultimately propagate and disrupt broader grid operations. These attacks undermine the integrity of smart meter data, enabling malicious actors to manipulate consumption values without activating conventional alarms, thereby creating serious vulnerabilities across both residential and utility-scale infrastructures. This paper presents a machine learning-based framework for both the detection and classification of FDIAs using residential energy data. A real-time detection is provided by the lightweight Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which works by using the most vital features of energy consumption, cost, and time context. For the classification of different attack types, a Bidirectional LSTM is trained to recognize normal, trapezoidal, and sigmoid attack shapes through learning sequential dependencies in the data. A synthetic time-series dataset was generated to emulate realistic household behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models are effective in identifying and classifying FDIAs, offering a scalable solution for enhancing grid resilience at the edge. This work contributes toward building intelligent, data-driven defence mechanisms that strengthen smart grid cybersecurity from residential endpoints.</p>

            <p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique. Its performance depends strongly on the wireless channel property, which can be enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we jointly optimize base station (BS) precoding and RIS configuration with unsupervised machine learning (ML), which looks for the optimal solution autonomously. In particular, we propose a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet inspired by domain knowledge in communication. Compared to state-of-the-art, the proposed approach combines analytical optimal BS precoding and ML-enabled RIS, has a high scalability to control more than 1000 RIS elements, has a low requirement for channel state information (CSI) in input, and addresses the mutual coupling between RIS elements. Beyond the considered problem, this work is an early contribution to domain knowledge enabled ML, which exploit the domain expertise of communication systems to design better approaches than general ML methods.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian-Driven Graph Reasoning for Active Radio Map Construction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlihan Lu, Shijian Gao, Miaowen Wen, Yuxuan Liang, Chan-Byoung Chae, H. Vincent Poor</p>
            <p>With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.</p>

            <h2>Imperfect Competition in Markets for Short-Circuit Current Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>An important limitation of Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) is their reduced contribution to Short-Circuit Current (SCC), as compared to that of Synchronous Generators (SGs). With increasing penetration of IBR in most power systems, the reducing SCC poses challenges to a secure system operation, as line protections may not trip when required. In order to address this issue, the SCC ancillary service could be procured via an economic mechanism, aiming at securing adequate SCC on all buses. However, the suitability of markets for SCC services is not well understood, given that these could be prone to market-power issues: since the SCC contributions from various SGs to a certain bus are determined by the electrical topology of the grid, this is a highly local service. It is necessary to understand if SGs at advantageous electrical locations could exert market power and, if so, how it could be mitigated. In order to fill this gap, this paper adopts an SCC-constrained bilevel model to investigate strategic behaviors of SGs. To address the non-convexity due to unit commitment variables, the model is restructured through a primal-dual formulation. Based on a modified IEEE 30-bus system, cases with strategic SGs placed at different buses are analyzed. These studies demonstrate that agents exerting market power could achieve up to triple revenues from SCC provision, highlighting the need to carefully design these markets.</p>

            <h2>Integrated Learning and Optimization to Control Load Demand and Wind Generation for Minimizing Ramping Cost in Real-Time Electricity Market</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imran Pervez, Omar Knio</p>
            <p>We developed a new integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodology to predict context-aware unknown parameters in economic dispatch (ED), a crucial problem in power systems solved to generate optimal power dispatching decisions to serve consumer load. The ED formulation in the current study consists of load and renewable generation as unknown parameters in its constraints predicted using contextual information (e.g., prior load, temperature). The ILO framework train a neural network (NN) to estimate ED parameters by minimizing an application-specific regret function which is a difference between ground truth and NN-driven decisions favouring better ED decisions. We thoroughly analyze the feasible region of ED formulation to understand the impact of load and renewable learning together on the ED decisions. Corresponding to that we developed a new regret function to capture real-time electricity market operations where differences in predicted and true loads are corrected by ramping generators in real-time but at a higher cost than the market price. The proposed regret function when minimized using ILO framework train the NN to guide the load and renewable predictions to generate ED decisions favouring minimum generator ramping costs. This is unlike conventional sequential learning and optimization (SLO) framework which train NN to accurately estimate load and renewable instead of better ED decisions. The combined training of load and renewable using ILO is a new concept and lead to significantly improved ramping costs when compared with SLO based training of load and renewable and SLO trained load with 100% accurate renewable proving its decision-focused capability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunmei Xu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Peiying Zhu</p>
            <p>Next-generation wireless networks (6G) face a critical uplink bottleneck due to stringent device-side resource constraints and challenging channel conditions. This article introduces GenCom, a novel system-level paradigm for robust 6G uplink that leverages Generative AI and exploits the inherent resource imbalance between transmitters and receivers. In GenCom, resource-rich receivers deploy powerful offline-trained GenAI models to reconstruct high semantic-fidelity content from degraded signals, while resource-constrained transmitters are simplified in both source and channel coding design. We present the core mechanisms and key design principles behind GenCom, which shifts from conventional approaches toward simple semantic-preserving compression, weak error-distribution codes, and semantic-aware retransmissions. Through a case study, GenCom is shown to deliver robust performance across a wide range of low and uncertain SNR/SINR conditions where conventional systems fail. Finally, we outline critical challenges and research directions toward making GenCom a practical enabler of future human-centric, intelligent, and sustainable wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Satellites are closer than you think: A near field MIMO approach for Ground stations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohith Reddy Vennam, Luke Wilson, Ish Kumar Jain, Dinesh Bharadia</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has revolutionized broadband access, earth observation, and direct-to-device connectivity. However, the expansion of ground station infrastructure has not kept pace, creating a critical bottleneck in satellite-to-ground backhaul capacity. Traditional parabolic dish antennas, though effective for geostationary (GEO) satellites, are ill-suited for dense, fastmoving LEO networks due to mechanical steering delays and their inability to track multiple satellites simultaneously. Phased array antennas offer electronically steerable beams and multisatellite support, but their integration into ground stations is limited by the high cost, hardware issues, and complexity of achieving sufficient antenna gain. We introduce ArrayLink, a distributed phased array architecture that coherently combines multiple small commercially available panels to achieve high-gain beamforming and unlock line-of-sight MIMO spatial multiplexing with minimal additional capital expenditure. By spacing 16 (32x32) panels across a kilometer-scale aperture, ArrayLink enters the radiative near-field, focusing energy in both angle and range while supporting up to four simultaneous spatial streams on a single feeder link. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, detailed 2D beam pattern simulations and real-world hardware experiments, we show that ArrayLink (i) achieves dish-class gain with in range 1-2 dB of 1.47 m reflector, (ii) maintains four parallel streams at ranges of hundreds of kilometers (falling to two beyond 2000 km), and (iii) exhibits tight agreement across theory, simulation, and experiment with minimal variance. These findings open a practical and scalable path to boosting LEO backhaul capacity.</p>

            <h2>Spectrum Efficiency and Processing Latency Trade-offs in Panel-Based LIS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lina Tinnerberg, Dumitra Iancu, Ove Edfors, Liang Liu, Juan Vidal Alegría</p>
            <p>The next generation wireless systems will face stringent new requirements, including ultra-low latency, high data rates and enhanced reliability. Large Intelligent Surfaces, is one proposed solution that has the potential to solve these high demands. The real-life deployment of such systems involves different design considerations with non-trivial trade-offs. This paper investigates the trade-off between spectral efficiency and processing latency, considering different antenna distribution schemes and detection algorithms. A latency model for the physical layer processing has been developed, using real FPGA and application-specific instruction processor (ASIP) hardware implementation results. Simulation results using an indoor environment show that distributing antennas throughout the scenario improves overall reliability, while the impact from this on latency is limited both when using zero-forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detection. Changing the detection algorithm to maximum-ratio combining (MRC) from ZF or MMSE, however, reduces the latency significantly, even if a larger number of antennas are needed to achieve a similar spectrum efficiency.</p>

            <p>This study presents a polarization-insensitive ultra-broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and evaluates machine learning methods for predicting its absorption performance. The structure consists of a VO2 metasurface, a MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. It achieves more than 90% absorption between 5.72 and 11.11 THz, covering a 5.38 THz bandwidth with an average absorptance of 98.15%. A dataset of 9,018 samples was generated from full-wave simulations by varying patch width, dielectric thickness, and frequency. Six regression models were trained: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Bagging. Performance was measured using adjusted R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Ensemble models achieved the best results, with Bagging reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.9985 and RMSE of 0.0146. The workflow offers a faster alternative to exhaustive simulations and can be applied to other metamaterial designs, enabling efficient evaluation and optimization.</p>

            <h2>DeePConverter: A Data-Driven Optimal Control Architecture for Grid-Connected Power Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Leng, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Ping Ju, Xiongfei Wang, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Grid-connected power converters are ubiquitous in modern power systems, acting as grid interfaces of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, high-voltage DC systems, etc. Conventionally, power converters use multiple PID regulators to achieve different control objectives such as grid synchronization and voltage/power regulations, where the PID parameters are usually tuned based on a presumed (and often overly-simplified) power grid model. However, this may lead to inferior performance or even instabilities in practice, as the real power grid is highly complex, variable, and generally unknown. To tackle this problem, we employ a data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) to perform data-driven, optimal, and robust control for power converters. We call the converters that are operated in this way \textit{DeePConverters}. A DeePConverter can implicitly perceive the characteristics of the power grid from data and adjust its control strategy to achieve optimal and robust performance. We present the modular configurations, generalized structure, control behavior specification, detailed implementation, and computation of DeePConverters. High-fidelity simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of DeePConverters.</p>

            <h2>Smart Residential Community Simulator for Developing and Benchmarking Energy Management Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ninad Gaikwad, Anamika Dubey</p>
            <p>Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are being actively developed for both individual houses and communities to support demand response in on-grid operation, and ensure resilience during off-grid scenarios. However, most simulators used for closed-loop HEMS testing are tailored to a specific distributed energy resource (DER) configuration with a fixed number of houses, limiting flexibility and scalability. This leads to additional development efforts to support diverse DER configurations across any number of houses and to integrate appropriate weather and load data pipelines. To address these limitations, we present a scalable simulator capable of modeling any number of houses in both on-grid and off-grid modes as a Gymnasium environment. Each house can have a unique DER configuration - Rooftop Solar Photovoltaics (PV), Battery-only, PV-only, or no DER - and includes models for air-conditioning and eight grouped circuit-level loads. The simulator integrates National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) weather and Pecan Street load datasets, supports three default controllers (two for off-grid, and one for on-grid scenarios), and includes performance metrics and visualization tools. We demonstrate its flexibility through simulations on individual houses and a four-house community with heterogeneous DERs, benchmarking the controllers across built-in metrics and computation time. The results highlight the simulator's capability to systematically evaluate control policy performance under varying system configurations.</p>

            <p>This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information through a novel hidden function. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Zhao, Jin Wei-Kocsis, Adel Heidari Akhijahani, Karen L Butler-Purry</p>
            <p>Driven by recent advances in sensing and computing, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technologies have shown great potential for addressing distribution system restoration (DSR) under uncertainty. However, their data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit their ability to handle scenarios that require long-term temporal dependencies or few-shot and zero-shot decision making. Emerging Decision Transformers (DTs), which leverage causal transformers for sequence modeling in DRL tasks, offer a promising alternative. However, their reliance on return-to-go (RTG) cloning and limited generalization capacity restricts their effectiveness in dynamic power system environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Dual-Head Physics-informed Graph Decision Transformer (DH-PGDT) that integrates physical modeling, structural reasoning, and subgoal-based guidance to enable scalable and robust DSR even in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. DH-PGDT features a dual-head physics-informed causal transformer architecture comprising Guidance Head, which generates subgoal representations, and Action Head, which uses these subgoals to generate actions independently of RTG. It also incorporates an operational constraint-aware graph reasoning module that encodes power system topology and operational constraints to generate a confidence-weighted action vector for refining DT trajectories. This design effectively improves generalization and enables robust adaptation to unseen scenarios. While this work focuses on DSR, the underlying computing model of the proposed PGDT is broadly applicable to sequential decision making across various power system operations and other complex engineering domains.</p>

The system is analyzed from an embedded microcontroller and embedded software perspective using Arduino. The photovoltaic panel uses four light photocell resistors (LPRs) which measure solar light intensity. An ultrasonic sensor measures the water level in a reservoir water tank. If the water level is too low, water is pumped from one water tank to the reservoir tank. Using a soil moisture sensor, another water pump pumps water from the reservoir tank to the plant if water is needed.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huangbin Liang, Beatriz Moya, Francisco Chinesta, Eleni Chatzi</p>
            <p>Electric power networks are critical lifelines, and their disruption during earthquakes can lead to severe cascading failures and significantly hinder post-disaster recovery. Enhancing their seismic resilience requires identifying and strengthening vulnerable components in a cost-effective and system-aware manner. However, existing studies often overlook the systemic behavior of power networks under seismic loading. Common limitations include isolated component analyses that neglect network-wide interdependencies, oversimplified damage models assuming binary states or damage independence, and the exclusion of electrical operational constraints. These simplifications can result in inaccurate risk estimates and inefficient retrofit decisions. This study proposes a multi-model probabilistic framework for seismic risk assessment and retrofit planning of electric power systems. The approach integrates: (1) regional seismic hazard characterization with ground motion prediction and spatial correlation models; (2) component-level damage analysis using fragility functions and multi-state damage-functionality mappings; (3) system-level cascading impact evaluation through graph-based island detection and constrained optimal power flow analysis; and (4) retrofit planning via heuristic optimization to minimize expected annual functionality loss (EAFL) under budget constraints. Uncertainty is propagated throughout the framework using Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology is demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System, showcasing its ability to capture cascading failures, identify critical components, and generate effective retrofit strategies. Results underscore the potential of the framework as a scalable, data-informed decision-support tool for enhancing the seismic resilience of power infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Participation of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in bid-based Transactive Energy Systems (TES) at the distribution systems facilitates strongly coupled, bidirectional interactions between Transmission-Distribution (T-D) systems. Capturing these interactions is critical for ensuring seamless integration within an Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) framework. This study proposes a methodology to preserve such tight T-D linkages by developing an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) managed bid-based TES design for unbalanced distribution systems. The proposed design operates within the ITD paradigm and permits DER participation in the Wholesale Power Market (WPM) through IDSO while preserving tight T-D linkages. To this end, this research offers the following key contributions: a novel bid/offer prequalification-cum-aggregation method to ensure a grid-safe and value-based aggregation of DERs' bids and offers for WPM participation through IDSO; and a retail pricing mechanism that reflects the true value of procuring or offering additional units of power within the distribution system. Case studies are conducted on a modified IEEE 123-bus radial feeder populated with a high DER concentration to validate the proposed frameworks' effectiveness in coordinating the DERs efficiently and reliably.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous Air-Ground Vehicle Operations Optimization in Hazardous Environments: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimin Choi, Max Z. Li</p>
            <p>Hazardous environments such as chemical spills, radiological zones, and bio-contaminated sites pose significant threats to human safety and public infrastructure. Rapid and reliable hazard mitigation in these settings often unsafe for humans, calling for autonomous systems that can adaptively sense and respond to evolving risks. This paper presents a decision-making framework for autonomous vehicle dispatch in hazardous environments with uncertain and evolving risk levels. The system integrates a Bayesian Upper Confidence Bound (BUCB) sensing strategy with task-specific vehicle routing problems with profits (VRPP), enabling adaptive coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for hazard sensing and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for cleaning. Using VRPP allows selective site visits under resource constraints by assigning each site a visit value that reflects sensing or cleaning priorities. Site-level hazard beliefs are maintained through a time-weighted Bayesian update. BUCB scores guide UAV routing to balance exploration and exploitation under uncertainty, while UGV routes are optimized to maximize expected hazard reduction under resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework reduces the number of dispatch cycles to resolve hazards by around 30% on average compared to baseline dispatch strategies, underscoring the value of uncertainty-aware vehicle dispatch for reliable hazard mitigation.</p>

            <p>Mitigating traffic oscillations in mixed flows of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is critical for enhancing traffic stability. A key challenge lies in modeling the nonlinear, heterogeneous behaviors of HDVs within computationally tractable predictive control frameworks. This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) to address this issue. The framework features a novel deep Koopman network, AdapKoopnet, which represents complex HDV car-following dynamics as a linear system in a high-dimensional space by adaptively learning from naturalistic data. This learned linear representation is then embedded into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, enabling real-time, scalable, and optimal control of CAVs. We validate our framework using the HighD dataset and extensive numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that AdapKoopnet achieves superior trajectory prediction accuracy over baseline models. Furthermore, the complete AdapKoopPC controller significantly dampens traffic oscillations with lower computational cost, exhibiting strong performance even at low CAV penetration rates. The proposed framework offers a scalable and data-driven solution for enhancing stability in realistic mixed traffic environments. The code is made publicly available.</p>

            <p>Learning the site-specific distribution of the wireless channel within a particular environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we combine the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with generative modeling, in particular, sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM), to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our methods can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, they are physically interpretable and generalize over system configurations without requiring retraining.</p>

            <h2>Functional Controllability, Functional Stabilizability, and the Generalized Separation Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyrone Fernando, Mohamed Darouach</p>
            <p>This paper introduces the new concepts of Functional Controllability and Functional Stabilizability, and establishes their duality with Functional Observability and Functional Detectability, respectively. A Generalized Separation Principle is presented, under which the classical Separation Principle emerges as a special case. Conditions for the existence of functional controllers of a specified order are derived. Notably, the proposed design framework does not require full controllability. In addition, a functional observer-based controller design is developed for systems that may be both uncontrollable and unobservable. The results presented extend and generalize the classical full-state observer based feedback control paradigm.</p>

            <h2>A United Framework for Planning Electric Vehicle Charging Accessibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tony Kinchen, Panagiotis Typaldos, Andreas A. Malikopoulos</p>
            <p>The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for establishing sustainable and low-emission urban transportation systems. However, the success of this transition depends on the strategic placement of the charging infrastructure. This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing charging station locations in dense urban environments while balancing efficiency with spatial accessibility. We propose an optimization framework that integrates traffic simulation, energy consumption modeling, and a mobility equity measure to evaluate the social reach of each potential charging station. Using New York City as a case study, we demonstrate consistent improvements in accessibility (15-20% reduction in travel time variability). Our results provide a scalable methodology for incorporating equity considerations into EV infrastructure planning, although economic factors and grid integration remain important areas for future development.</p>

            <h2>Semantic Reasoning Meets Numerical Precision: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Zhang</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>Full-Dimensional Beamforming for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM ISAC for Low-Altitude UAV with Zero Sensing Resource Allocation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an important role for low-altitude economy with a wide range of applications like precise agriculture, aerial delivery and surveillance. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key technology to enable the large-scale deployment and routine usage of UAVs by providing both communication and sensing services efficiently. For UAV ISAC systems, as UAV often acts as both a communication user equipment (UE) and a sensing target, traditional ISAC systems that usually allocate dedicated TF resources for sensing are inefficient due to the severe degradation of communication spectral efficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC framework for UAVs that eliminates the need for dedicated sensing TF resources, achieving zero TF sensing overhead. By designing the transmit beamforming to meet the requirements for both communication and sensing tasks, our proposed approach enables the communication TF resources to be fully reused for sensing, thereby enhancing both the communication sum rate and the sensing performance in terms of resolution, unambiguous range, and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a low-complexity target searching beamforming algorithm and a two-stage super-resolution sensing algorithm, which ensure efficient implementation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-ISAC framework not only improves the communication sum rate but also outperforms traditional ISAC systems in sensing performance, making it a promising solution for future ISAC systems to support low-altitude UAVs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Du, Karl H. Johansson, Apostolos I. Rikos</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of decentralized consensus optimization over directed graphs with limited communication bandwidth. We introduce a novel decentralized optimization algorithm that combines the Reduced Consensus Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (RC-ALADIN) method with a finite time quantized coordination protocol, enabling quantized information exchange among nodes. Assuming the nodes' local objective functions are $\mu$-strongly convex and simply smooth, we establish global convergence at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with the neighborhood size determined by the quantization level. Additionally, we show that the same convergence result also holds for the case where the local objective functions are convex and $L$-smooth. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed algorithm compares favorably against algorithms in the current literature while exhibiting communication efficient operation.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance wireless communication by dynamically shaping the propagation environment, but their integration introduces hardware-level security risks. This paper presents the concept of Malicious RIS (MALRIS), where compromised components behave adversarially, even under passive operation. The focus of this work is on practical threats such as manufacturing time tampering, malicious firmware, and partial element control. Two representative attacks, power-splitting and element-splitting, are modeled to assess their impact. Simulations in a RIS-assisted system reveal that even a limited hardware compromise can significantly degrade performance metrics such as bit error rate, throughput, and secrecy metrics. By exposing this overlooked threat surface, this work aims to promote awareness and support secure, trustworthy RIS deployment in future wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Diversity Analysis for Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Almutasem Bellah Enad, Jihad Fahs, Hakim Jemaa, Hadi Sarieddeen, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri</p>
            <p>The terahertz (THz) band is a key enabler for future wireless systems, promising ultra-high data rates and dense spatial reuse. However, the reliability of THz links remains a major challenge due to severe path loss and small-scale fading effects, particularly in dynamic indoor and outdoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive diversity analysis framework for THz communication systems under realistic small-scale fading conditions. We model fading statistically using the generalized $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution for indoor scenarios and the mixture of gamma (MG) model for outdoor propagation. We complement previous works that analyzed diversity under $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels [1],[2]. In particular, we present new insights on diversity for the MG channel in addition to recovering the results of [2] using a different approach. Moreover, we derive asymptotic expressions for the bit error rate as a function of the inverse signal-to-noise ratio, recovering all of the $\alpha$-$\mu$ diversity results using a simpler approximation method. The analytical results are extensively validated through Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement. Our findings show that the achievable diversity in THz systems is strongly influenced by the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and frequency selectivity. The proposed framework provides system designers with clear guidelines to quantify and optimize diversity gains under emerging channel models, paving the way for more reliable high-frequency wireless links in next-generation networks.</p>

            <h2>How to Proactively Monitor Untrusted Communications with Cell-Free Massive MIMO?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Isabella W. G. da Silva, Zahra Mobini, Hien Q. Ngo, Hyundong Shin, Michail Matthaiou</p>
            <p>This paper studies a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) proactive monitoring system in which multiple multi-antenna monitoring nodes (MNs) are assigned to either observe the transmissions from an untrusted transmitter (UT) or to jam the reception at the untrusted receiver (UR). We propose an effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme for the monitoring system. In our approach, the MNs leverage the pilot signals transmitted during the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link and estimate the effective channels corresponding to the UT and UR via a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation scheme. We derive new spectral efficiency (SE) expressions for the untrusted link and the monitoring system. For the latter, the SE is derived for two CSI availability cases at the central processing unit (CPU); namely case-1: imperfect CSI knowledge at both MNs and CPU, case-2: imperfect CSI knowledge at the MNs and no CSI knowledge at the CPU. To improve the monitoring performance, we propose a novel joint mode assignment and jamming power control optimization method to maximize the monitoring success probability (MSP) based on the Bayesian optimization framework. Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach significantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the number of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the untrusted transmission link.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srivathsa Acharya, P. Vijay Kumar, Viveck R. Cadambe</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of data storage in a geographically distributed (or geo-distributed) network of servers (or nodes) where inter-node communication incurs certain round-trip delays. Every node serves a set of users who can request any file in the network. If the requested file is not available at the node, it communicates with other nodes to obtain the file, thus causing the user to experience latency in obtaining the file. The files can be placed uncoded, where each node stores exact copies of the files, or in coded fashion, where certain linear combination of files are placed at each node. We aim to obtain an optimal file placement on the nodes with respect to minimizing the worst-case latency at each node, as well as the system-average latency. The prior literature considered the case of equiprobable file demands at the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the generic case of non-uniform file-demand probabilities at each node. The scheme presented here is optimal within the family of uncoded schemes. It is obtained first by modeling the worst-case latency constraint as a vertex coloring problem, and then converting the system-average latency optimization to a problem of balanced-assignment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wafeeq Jaleel, Md Ragib Rownak, Athar Hanif, Sidra Ghayour Bhatti, Qadeer Ahmed</p>
            <p>As hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) gain traction in heavy-duty trucks, adaptive and efficient energy management is critical for reducing fuel consumption while maintaining battery charge for long operation times. We present a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm to optimize engine control in series HEVs. We reformulate the control task as a sequential decision-making problem and enhance SAC by incorporating Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Decision Transformers (DTs) into both actor and critic networks to capture temporal dependencies and improve planning over time. To evaluate robustness and generalization, we train the models under diverse initial battery states, drive cycle durations, power demands, and input sequence lengths. Experiments show that the SAC agent with a DT-based actor and GRU-based critic was within 1.8% of Dynamic Programming (DP) in fuel savings on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET) cycle, while the SAC agent with GRUs in both actor and critic networks, and FFN actor-critic agent were within 3.16% and 3.43%, respectively. On unseen drive cycles (US06 and Heavy Heavy-Duty Diesel Truck (HHDDT) cruise segment), generalized sequence-aware agents consistently outperformed feedforward network (FFN)-based agents, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in real-world settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aleksander Grochowicz, Hannah C. Bloomfield, Marta Victoria</p>
            <p>Security of supply is a common and important concern when integrating renewables in net-zero power systems. Extreme weather affects both demand and supply leading to power system stress; in Europe this stress spreads continentally beyond the meteorological root cause. We use an approach based on shadow prices to identify periods of elevated stress called system-defining events and analyse their impact on the power system. By classifying different types of system-defining events, we identify challenges to power system operation and planning. Crucially, we find the need for sufficient resilience back-up (power) capacities whose financial viability is precarious due to weather variability. Furthermore, we disentangle short- and long-term resilience challenges with distinct metrics and stress tests to incorporate both into future energy modelling assessments. Our methodology and implementation in the open model PyPSA-Eur can be re-applied to other systems and help researchers and policymakers in building more resilient and adequate energy systems.</p>

            <p>The application of big data is one of the significant features of integrated smart energy. Applying it to the file management of integrated smart energy projects is of great significance for improving the efficiency of project management and control. This article first discussed the benefits and challenges of implementing big data analysis in document management and control of integrated smart energy projects. In addition, an implementation framework for big data analysis in integrated smart energy project document management was developed, and a method for optimizing the efficiency of integrated smart energy project document management through machine learning was proposed. Using various types of data and information generated during the project document management process, the efficiency of the entire process project document control through three different machine learning methods was optimized. The result of fitting a penalty linear regression model shows that when there is enough data as a training set, the accuracy of the model achieved can reach over 95\%. By using big data analysis and machine learning to analyze the efficiency of comprehensive smart energy project document management, it is possible to track the entire process of comprehensive smart energy project documents and optimize business processes, thereby strengthening project construction control and improving project construction efficiency.</p>

Within this framework, two power allocation strategies are investigated: the first optimally distributes power between near and far industrial nodes, and the second prioritizes network demands to enhance system performance further. A performance evaluation is conducted to compare the sum rate and outage probability against a fixed power allocation scheme. Our scheme achieves up to a 23% sum rate gain over fixed PA at 30 dBm. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the RIS-assisted NOMA MIMO framework for THz enabled industrial communications.</p>

            <p>This paper studies the finite-horizon robust optimal control of linear systems subject to model mismatch and additive stochastic disturbances. Utilizing the system level synthesis (SLS) parameterization, we propose a novel SLS design using output-feedback affine control policy and extend it to a distributionally robust setting to improve system resilience by minimizing the cost function while ensuring constraint satisfaction against the worst-case uncertainty distribution. The scopes of model mismatch and stochastic disturbances are quantified using the 1-norm and a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, respectively. For the closed-loop dynamics, we analyze the distributional shift between the predicted output-input response -- computed using nominal parameters and empirical disturbance samples -- and the actual closed-loop distribution, highlighting its dependence on model mismatch and SLS parameterization. Assuming convex and Lipschitz continuous cost functions and constraints, we derive a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust SLS (DR-SLS) problem by leveraging tools from robust control and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
            <p>Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and block measurement data transmission in power grids, impairing or delaying system protection and recovery. This paper investigates the fault diagnosis problem for a linearized (DC) power flow model under PCPA. The physical attack mechanism includes not only line disconnection but also admittance modification, for example via compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this problem, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on meta-mixed-integer programming (MMIP), integrating graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL). First, we derive measurement reconstruction conditions that allow reconstructing unknown measurements in attacked areas from available measurements and the system topology. Based on these conditions, we formulate the diagnosis task as an MMIP model. The GAT-FL predicts a probability distribution over potential physical attacks, which is then incorporated as objective coefficients in the MMIP. Solving the MMIP yields optimal attack location and magnitude estimates, from which the system states are also reconstructed. Experimental simulations are conducted on IEEE 30/118 bus standard test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.</p>

We aim to maximize the achievable sum rate of the users while ensuring the constraints of transmit power, STAR-RIS coefficients, and the actual rate of the common stream for all users. To solve this challenging high-coupling and non-convexity problem, we adopt a fractional programming (FP)-based alternating optimization (AO) approach, where each sub-problem is addressed via successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty function (PF) methods. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other multiple access schemes and conventional passive RIS in terms of the achievable sum rate. Additionally, considering the HWI of the transceiver and STAR-RIS makes our algorithm more robust than when such considerations are not included.</p>

            <p>Functional brain network analysis has become an indispensable tool for brain disease analysis. It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a synthesis method for robust, regret optimal control. The plant is modeled in discrete-time by an uncertain linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An optimal non-causal controller is constructed using the nominal plant model and given full knowledge of the disturbance. Robust regret is defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a robust $H_\infty$ performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of robust regret. The approach is demonstrated three examples: (i) a simple single-input, single-output classical design, (ii) a longitudinal control for a simplified model for a Boeing 747 model, and (iii) an active suspension for a quarter car model. All examples compare the robust regret optimal against regret optimal controllers designed without uncertainty.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniket Johri, Divyanshi Dwivedi, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment.

            <p>In this paper, we propose an energy efficient wireless communication system based on fluid antenna relay (FAR) to solve the problem of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links caused by blockages with considering the physical properties. Driven by the demand for the sixth generation (6G) communication, fluid antenna systems (FASs) have become a key technology due to their flexibility in dynamically adjusting antenna positions. Existing research on FAS primarily focuses on line-of-sight (LoS) communication scenarios, and neglects the situations where only NLoS links exist. To address the issues posted by NLoS communication, we design an FAR-assisted communication system combined with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In order to alleviate the high energy consumption introduced by AF protocol while ensuring communication quality, we formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem. By optimizing the positions of the fluid antennas (FAs) on both sides of the FAR, we achieve controllable phase shifts of the signals transmitting through the blockage which causes the NLoS link. Besides, we establish a channel model that jointly considers the blockage-through matrix, large-scale fading, and small-scale fading. To maximize the EE of the system, we jointly optimize the FAR position, FA positions, power control, and beamforming design under given constraints, and propose an iterative algorithm to solve this formulated optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional schemes in terms of EE, achieving up to $23.39\%$ and $39.94\%$ higher EE than the conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) scheme and traditional AF relay scheme, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Improving Sequential Market Coordination via Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yufan Zhang, Honglin Wen, Yuexin Bian, Yuanyuan Shi</p>
            <p>Large penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings huge uncertainty into the electricity markets. The current deterministic clearing approach in the day-ahead (DA) market, where RESs participate based on expected production, has been criticized for causing a lack of coordination between the DA and real-time (RT) markets, leading to high overall operating costs. Previous works indicate that improving day-ahead RES entering quantities can significantly mitigate the drawbacks of deterministic clearing. In this work, we propose using a trained forecasting model, referred to as value-oriented forecasting, to determine RES Improved Entering Quantities (RIEQ) more efficiently during the operational phase. Unlike traditional models that minimize statistical forecasting errors, our approach trains model parameters to minimize the expected overall operating costs across both DA and RT markets. We derive the exact form of the loss function used for training, which becomes piecewise linear when market clearing is modeled by linear programs. Additionally, we provide the analytical gradient of the loss function with respect to the forecast, enabling an efficient training strategy. Numerical studies demonstrate that our forecasts significantly reduce overall operating costs for deterministic market clearing compared to conventional forecasts based on expected RES production.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Power Flow and Optimal Power Flow based on Combinatorial Reformulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), its hybrid quantum-classical solver (HA), as well as the third-generation Digital Annealer (DAv3) and Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO) developed by Fujitsu. The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>Coded Kalman Filtering over MIMO Gaussian Channels with Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Barron Han, Oron Sabag, Victoria Kostina, Babak Hassibi</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of remotely stabilizing a dynamical system. A sensor (encoder) co-located with the system communicates with a controller (decoder), whose goal is to stabilize the system, over a noisy communication channel with feedback. To accomplish this, the controller must estimate the system state with finite mean squared error (MSE). The vector-valued dynamical system state follows a Gauss-Markov law with additive control. The channel is a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with feedback. For such a source, a linear encoder, and a MIMO AWGN channel, the minimal MSE decoder is a Kalman filter. The parameters of the Kalman filter and the linear encoder can be jointly optimized, under a power constraint at the channel input. We term the resulting encoder-decoder pair a coded Kalman filter. We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the coded Kalman filter to achieve a finite MSE in the real-time estimation of the state. For sufficiency, we introduce a coding scheme where each unstable mode of the state is estimated using the channel outputs of a single sub-channel. We prove a coinciding necessity condition when either the source or channel is scalar and present a matrix-algebraic condition which implies the condition is necessary in general. Finally, we provide a new counter-example demonstrating that linear codes are generally sub-optimal for coding over MIMO channels.</p>

            <h2>An AI-driven EDA Algorithm-Empowered VCO and LDO Co-Design Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijia Hao, Maarten Strackx, Miguel Gandara, Sandy Cochran, Bo Liu</p>
            <p>Traditionally, the output noise and power supply rejection of low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are optimized to minimize power supply fluctuations, reducing their impact on the low-frequency noise of target voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). However, this sequential design approach does not fully address the trade-offs between high-frequency and LDO-induced low-frequency phase noise. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a co-design method for low phase-noise LC-tank VCOs powered by LDOs. It is difficult to carry out the co-design using traditional manual design techniques. Hence, an efficient AI-driven EDA algorithm is used. To validate the proposed method, a 5.6 GHz LC-tank VCO with an integrated LDO is designed using a 65 nm CMOS process. Simulations show that the co-design method improves phase noise by 1.2 dB at a 1 MHz offset and reduces dynamic power consumption by 28.8%, with FoM increased by 2.4 dBc/Hz compared to the conventional sequential design method.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Upstream Supply Chains into Generation Expansion Planning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyu Yao, Andrey Bernstein, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</p>

            <h2>Grid-Forming Vector Current Control FRT Modes Under Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Faults</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ognjen Stanojev, Orcun Karaca, Mario Schweizer</p>
            <p>Recent research has shown that operating grid-connected converters using the grid-forming vector current control (GFVCC) scheme offers significant benefits, including the simplicity and modularity of the control architecture, as well as enabling a seamless transition from PLL-based grid-following control to grid-forming. An important aspect of any grid-connected converter control strategy is the handling of grid-fault scenarios such as symmetrical and asymmetrical short-circuit faults. This paper presents several fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for GFVCC that enable the converter to provide fault current and stay synchronized to the grid while respecting the converter hardware limitations and retaining grid-forming behavior. The converter control scheme is extended in a modular manner to include negative-sequence loops, and the proposed FRT strategies address both symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. The proposed FRT strategies are analyzed through case studies, including infinite-bus setups and multi-unit grids.</p>

            <p>Wireless positioning technologies hold significant value for applications in autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more. With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging AI to enhance positioning accuracy and robustness has emerged as a field full of potential. Driven by the requirements and functionalities defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, AI/machine learning (ML)-based cellular positioning is becoming a key technology to overcome the limitations of traditional methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven cellular positioning. We begin by reviewing the fundamentals of wireless positioning and AI models, analyzing their respective challenges and synergies. We provide a comprehensive review of the evolution of 3GPP positioning standards, with a focus on the integration of AI/ML in current and upcoming standard releases. Guided by the 3GPP-defined taxonomy, we categorize and summarize state-of-the-art (SOTA) research into two major classes: AI/ML-assisted positioning and direct AI/ML-based positioning. The former includes line-of-sight (LOS)/non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection, time of arrival (TOA)/time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation, and angle prediction; the latter encompasses fingerprinting, knowledge-assisted learning, and channel charting. Furthermore, we review representative public datasets and conduct performance evaluations of AI-based positioning algorithms using these datasets. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the challenges and opportunities of AI-driven wireless positioning.</p>

            <h2>Estimating Reliability of Electric Vehicle Charging Ecosystem using the Principle of Maximum Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Tripathi, Subash Neupane, Shahram Rahimi, Noorbakhsh Amiri Golilarz, Sudip Mittal, Mohammad Sepehrifar</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the critical challenge of estimating the reliability of an Electric Vehicle (EV) charging systems when facing risks such as overheating, unpredictable, weather, and cyberattacks. Traditional methods for predicting failures often rely on past data or limiting assumptions, making them ineffective for new or less common threats that results in failure. To solve this issue, we utilize the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME), a statistical tool that estimates risks even with limited information. PME works by balancing known constraints to create an unbiased predictions without guessing missing details. Using the EV charging ecosystem as a case study, we show how PME models stress factors responsible for failure. Our findings reveal a critical insight: even minor, localized stress events can trigger disproportionately large drops in overall system reliability, similar to a domino effect. The our PME model demonstrates how high-impact components, such as the power grid, are more likely to fail as stress accumulates, creating network-wide tipping points. Beyond EVs, this approach applies to any complex system with incomplete data, such as smart grids, healthcare devices, or logistics networks. By mathematically establishing an inverse relationship between uncertainty (entropy) and reliability, our work quantifies how greater system unpredictability directly degrades robustness. This offers a universal tool to improve decision-making under unpredictable conditions. This work bridges advanced mathematics with real-world engineering, providing actionable insights for policymakers and industries to build safer, more efficient systems in our increasingly connected world.</p>

            <h2>Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Aditya Rangarajan, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper proposes to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing through consumer-based carbon costs. Specifically, consumers can submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. We start from a centralized market clearing that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation which incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and reductions in demand.</p>

            <p>As power systems evolve with increased integration of renewable energy sources, they become more complex and vulnerable to both cyber and physical threats. This study validates a centralized Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) algorithm designed to enhance the protection of power systems, particularly focusing on microgrids with substantial renewable energy integration. The algorithm utilizing a structured hypothesis testing framework, systematically identifies and differentiates anomalies caused by cyberattacks from those resulting from physical faults. This algorithm was evaluated through four case studies: a False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) via manipulation of Current Transformer (CT) ratios, a single line-to-ground (SLG) fault, and two combined scenarios involving both anomalies. Results from real-time simulations demonstrate that the algorithm effectively distinguishes between cyber-induced anomalies and physical faults, thereby significantly enhancing the reliability and security of energy systems. This research underscores the critical role of advanced diagnostic tools in protecting power systems against the growing prevalence of cyber-physical threats, enhancing the resilience of the grid and preventing potential blackouts by avoiding the mis-operation of protection relays.</p>

            <h2>Analog OFDM based on Real-Time Fourier Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaolu Yang, Oscar Céspedes Vicente, Christophe Caloz</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an analog orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture based on the real-time Fourier transform (RTFT). The core enabling component is a linear-chirp phaser with engineered group velocity dispersion (GVD), which realizes RTFT and performs frequency-to-time mapping in the analog domain. In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two linear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the OFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically equivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is further supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol transmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a prefix is applied. Benefiting from the use of passive microwave components, the analog OFDM system offers ultra-fast processing with reduced power consumption. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for fully analog or hybrid analog-digital OFDM system, offering a promising solution for next-generation high-speed, wideband, and energy-efficient wireless communication platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Wang, Jun Wang, Feng Deng, Chen Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai</p>
            <p>We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.</p>

We validate the proposed expression against numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.</p>

            <p>Integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) devices into the power grid brings many benefits. However, it also exposes the grid to new potential cyber threats. Many control and protection mechanisms, such as Load Frequency Control (LFC), responsible for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations and Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) disconnecting portion of the load during an emergency, are dependent on information exchange through the communication network. The recently emerging Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) utilize a botnet of high-wattage devices to introduce load fluctuation. In their dynamic form (DLAAs), they manipulate the load in response to live grid frequency measurements for increased efficiency, posing a notable threat to grid stability. Recognizing the importance of communication networks in power grid cyber security research, this paper presents an open-source co-simulation environment that models the power grid with the corresponding communication network, implementing grid protective mechanisms. This setup allows the comprehensive analysis of the attacks in concrete LFC and UFLS scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Hao Zhu, Duehee Lee, Ross Baldick</p>
            <p>For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN, we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinbing Jiang, Feng Shu, Xuehui Wang, Ke Yang, Chong Shen, Qi Zhang, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>Due to its ability of significantly improving data rate, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) will be a potential crucial technique for the future generation wireless networks like 6G. In this paper, we will focus on the analysis of degree of freedom (DoF) in IRS-aided multi-user MIMO network. Firstly, the DoF upper bound of IRS-aided single-user MIMO network, i.e., the achievable maximum DoF of such a system, is derived, and the corresponding results are extended to the case of IRS-aided multiuser MIMO by using the matrix rank inequalities. In particular, in serious rank-deficient, also called low-rank, channels like line-of-sight (LoS), the network DoF may doubles over no-IRS with the help of IRS. To verify the rate performance gain from augmented DoF, three closed-form beamforming methods, null-space projection plus maximize transmit power and maximize receive power (NSP-MTP-MRP), Schmidt orthogonalization plus minimum mean square error (SO-MMSE) and two-layer leakage plus MMSE (TLL-MMSE) are proposed to achieve the maximum DoF. Simulation results shows that IRS does make a dramatic rate enhancement. For example, in a serious deficient channel, the sum-rate of the proposed TLL-MMSE aided by IRS is about twice that of no IRS. This means that IRS may achieve a significant DoF improvement in such a channel.</p>

            <p>As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. Furthermore, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.</p>

The outcomes from both simulations and field tests affirm the substantial benefits of the proposed CACC platooning approach in longitudinal vehicle platooning scenarios. This research is crucial due to a notable gap in the existing literature; while numerous studies focus on simulated vehicle platooning systems, there is lack of research demonstrating these controllers on physical vehicle systems or robot platforms.

Foundation Models (FMs) can help improve forecasting of renewable generation and demand because FMs can rapidly process complex, high-dimensional time-series data. This review paper focuses on FMs in the realm of renewable energy forecasting, primarily focusing on wind and solar. We present an overview of the architectures, pretraining strategies, finetuning methods, and types of data used in the context of renewable energy forecasting. We emphasize the role of models that are trained at a large scale, domain specific Transformer architectures, where attention is paid to spatial temporal correlations, the embedding of domain knowledge, and also the brief and intermittent nature of renewable generation. We assess recent FM based advancements in forecast accuracy such as reconciling predictions over multiple time scales and quantifying uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting. We also review existing challenges and areas of improvement in long-term and multivariate time series forecasting. In this survey, a distinction between theory and practice is established regarding the use of FMs in the clean energy forecasting domain. Additionally, it critically assesses the strengths and weaknesses of FMs while advancing future research direction in this new and exciting area of forecasting.</p>

With the increasing adoption of distributed generation and emerging prosumer households, Energy Management Systems, which manage and apply flexibility of connected devices, are gaining popularity. While potentially beneficial to grid capacity, strategic energy management also adds to the complexity of distribution grid operation and planning processes. Novel approaches of time-series-based planning likewise face increasingly complex simulation scenarios and rising computational cost. Discrete event modelling helps facilitating simulations of such scenarios by restraining computation to the most relevant points in simulation time. We provide an enhancement of a discrete event distribution grid simulation software that offers fast implementation and testing of energy management algorithms, embedded into a feature-rich simulation environment. Physical models are specified using the Discrete Event System Specification. Furthermore, we contribute a communication protocol that makes use of the discrete event paradigm by only computing flexibility potential when necessary.</p>

            <h2>Asynchronous Grid Connections Providing Fast-Frequency Response: System Integration Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Wald, Amir Sajadi, Barry Mather, Giovanni De Carne</p>
            <p>This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.</p>

            <h2>PGLib-CO2: A Power Grid Library for Computing and Optimizing Carbon Emissions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's this http URL, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.</p>

            <h2>Harnessing Rydberg Atomic Receivers: From Quantum Physics to Wireless Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanbin Chen, Xufeng Guo, Chau Yuen, Yufei Zhao, Yong Liang Guan, Chong Meng Samson See, Merouane Débbah, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>The intrinsic integration of Rydberg atomic receivers into wireless communication systems is proposed, by harnessing the principles of quantum physics in wireless communications. More particularly, we conceive a pair of Rydberg atomic receivers, one incorporates a local oscillator (LO), referred to as an LO-dressed receiver, while the other operates without an LO and is termed an LO-free receiver. The appropriate wireless model is developed for each configuration, elaborating on the receiver's responses to the radio frequency (RF) signal, on the potential noise sources, and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. The developed wireless model conforms to the classical RF framework, facilitating compatibility with established signal processing methodologies. Next, we investigate the associated distortion effects that might occur, specifically identifying the conditions under which distortion arises and demonstrating the boundaries of linear dynamic ranges. This provides critical insights into its practical implementations in wireless systems. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided for characterizing the performance of wireless systems, harnessing this pair of Rydberg atomic receivers. Our results demonstrate that LO-dressed systems achieve a significant SNR gain of approximately 40~50 dB over conventional RF receivers in the standard quantum limit regime. This SNR head-room translates into reduced symbol error rates, enabling efficient and reliable transmission with higher-order constellations.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables radio systems to simultaneously sense and communicate with their environment. This paper, developed within the Hexa-X-II project funded by the European Union, presents a comprehensive cross-layer vision for ISAC in 6G networks, integrating insights from physical-layer design, hardware architectures, AI-driven intelligence, and protocol-level innovations. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles of ISAC, highlighting synergies and trade-offs between sensing and communication across different integration levels. Enabling technologies (such as multiband operation, massive and distributed MIMO, non-terrestrial networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning) are analyzed in conjunction with hardware considerations including waveform design, synchronization, and full-duplex operation. To bridge implementation and system-level evaluation, we introduce a quantitative cross-layer framework linking design parameters to key performance and value indicators. By synthesizing perspectives from both academia and industry, this paper outlines how deeply integrated ISAC can transform 6G into a programmable and context-aware platform supporting applications from reliable wireless access to autonomous mobility and digital twinning.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Planning for Enhancing the Resilience of Modern Distribution Systems Against Cyberattacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armita Khashayardoost, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Deepa Kundur</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of IoT-connected devices in smart grids has introduced new vulnerabilities at the distribution level. Of particular concern is the potential for cyberattacks that exploit high-wattage IoT devices, such as EV chargers, to manipulate local demand and destabilize the grid. While previous studies have primarily focused on such attacks at the transmission level, this paper investigates their feasibility and impact at the distribution level. We examine how cyberattackers can target voltage-sensitive nodes, especially those exposed by the presence of high-consumption devices, to cause voltage deviation and service disruption. Our analysis demonstrates that conventional grid protections are insufficient against these intelligent, localized attacks. To address this, we propose resilience strategies using distributed generation (DGs), exploring their role in preemptive planning. This research highlights the urgent need for distribution-level cyber resilience planning in smart grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salih Gümüsbuğa, Ozan Alp Topal, Özlem Tuğfe Demir</p>
            <p>Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Nemati, Ignacio Egido, Pedro Sánchez-Martín, Álvaro Ortega</p>
            <p>This paper compares the participation of Renewable-only Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) and grid-scale Electrical Storage Systems (ESSs) in energy and reserve markets, evaluating their technical performance, market strategies, and economic outcomes. To ensure a fair comparison, scheduling is analyzed over representative sample days that capture seasonal operating regimes, and the associated uncertainties are explicitly modeled. Two-stage robust optimization frameworks are employed: the RVPP model addresses price, generation, and demand uncertainties, whereas the ESS model considers price uncertainty only. In addition, an algorithm is proposed for sizing the ESS so that its market performance matches that of the RVPP. Simulations cover both favorable and unfavorable scenarios, reflecting seasonal energy limits for dispatchable resources, varying forecast errors for nondispatchable resources, and alternative uncertainty-management strategies. The results provide operators with quantitative guidance on the relative value of each approach.</p>

            <p>Zero-energy devices (ZEDs) are key enablers of sustainable Internet of Things networks by operating solely on harvested ambient energy. Their limited and dynamic energy budget calls for protocols that are energy-aware and intelligently adaptive. However, designing effective energy-aware protocols for ZEDs requires theoretical models that realistically reflect device constraints. Indeed, existing approaches often oversimplify key aspects such as energy information (EI) acquisition, task-level variability, and energy storage dynamics, limiting their practical relevance and transferability. This article addresses this gap by offering a structured overview of the key modeling components, trade-offs, and limitations involved in energy-aware ZED protocol design. For this, we dissect EI acquisition methods and costs, characterize core operational tasks, analyze energy usage models and storage constraints, and review representative protocol strategies. Moreover, we offer design insights and guidelines on how ZED operation protocols can leverage EI, often illustrated through selected in-house examples. Finally, we outline key research directions to inspire more efficient and scalable protocol solutions for future ZEDs.</p>

            <h2>Large Language Model-Based Framework for Explainable Cyberattack Detection in Automatic Generation Control Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Sharshar, Ahmad Mohammad Saber, Davor Svetinovic, Amr M. Youssef, Deepa Kundur, Ehab F. El-Saadany</p>
            <p>The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.</p>

            <h2>A reference frame-based microgrid primary control for ensuring global convergence to a periodic orbit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyuan Jiang, Constantino M. Lagoa, Daning Huang, Yan Li</p>
            <p>Power systems with a high penetration of renewable generation are vulnerable to frequency oscillation and voltage instability. Traditionally, the stability of power systems is considered either in terms of local stability or as an angle oscillator synchronization problem with the simplifying assumption that the dynamics of the amplitudes are on much shorter time scales. Without this assumption, however, the steady state being studied is essentially a limit cycle with the convergence of its orbit in question. In this paper, we present a method to analyze the orbital stability of a microgrid and propose a voltage controller for the inverter-interfaced renewable generators. The main hurdle to the problem lies in the constant terms in the rotating internal reference frames of each generator. We extend the shifted passivity of port-Hamiltonian systems to the analysis of limit cycles and prove that, if the system is shifted passive without considering these constant terms, then the periodic orbit is globally attractive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global stability result for non-nominal steady states of the microgrid in the full state space, which provides new insights into the synchronization phenomenon where the dissipativity of the system ensures convergence. The proposed controller is verified with a test microgrid, demonstrating its stability and transient smoothness compared to the standard droop control.</p>

            <h2>Mutual Coupling-Aware Channel Estimation and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pinjun Zheng, Simon Tarboush, Hadi Sarieddeen, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri</p>
            <p>This work studies the problems of channel estimation and beamforming for active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, incorporating the mutual coupling (MC) effect through an electromagnetically consistent model. We first demonstrate that MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing (CS) formulation, albeit with an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this increased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a low-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel estimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR) for the MC-aware estimation, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing matrices. This method achieves estimation accuracy close to the direct MC-aware CS method with less overall computational complexity. Furthermore, we consider the joint optimization of RIS configuration, base station precoding, and user combining in a single-user MIMO system. We employ an alternating optimization strategy to optimize these three beamformers. The primary challenge lies in optimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem non-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series expansion. Within the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously satisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration direction. Numerical results validate our proposal, demonstrating that the proposed channel estimation and beamforming methods effectively manage the MC in RIS, achieving higher spectral efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated vehicle dispatching and charging scheduling for an electric ride-hailing fleet under charging congestion and dynamic prices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai-Yu Ma, Richard D. Connors, Francesco Viti</p>
            <p>Effective utilization of charging station capacity plays an important role in enhancing the profitability of ride-hailing systems using electric vehicles. Existing studies assume constant energy prices and uncapacitated charging stations or do not explicitly consider vehicle queueing at charging stations, resulting in over-optimistic charging infrastructure utilization. In this study, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware) that anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging operations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging stations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead charging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy consumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response to vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed charging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study area with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000 customers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware policy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and +19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with different system parameters and managerial insights are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad S. Ramadan, Marfred Barrera, Mihai Anitescu, Sylvia Herbert</p>
            <p>The state of charge of battery systems is an important metric typically estimated by observation models, represented by open-circuit voltage graphs. These observation models are often nonlinear in the state of charge, resulting in varying observability from a state estimation perspective. In this paper, we employ a stochastic optimal control (also known as dual control) approach to simultaneously satisfy the control objective in the state of charge of battery systems and improve estimation accuracy. This is achieved implicitly by prioritizing trajectories that pass through high-observability regions of the state space, thereby improving the quality of future measurements. We apply our algorithm to a numerical simulation of a multi-battery system and show a statistical improvement in both the control objective and the state estimation error.</p>

We also present consistent simulation results for a platoon with a larger number of vehicles, under digital implementation of the controller. Both the simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the predictor-based CACC design in guaranteeing individual vehicle stability, string stability, and tracking, despite long/distinct actuation delays.</p>

            <p>With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</p>

Additionally, it maintains a low SLA violation rate of 1.5\%, compared to 3.0\% for RL and 4.8\% for heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\% improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\% reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly solution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior performance in balancing multiple objectives.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xu Yang, Chenhui Lin, Yue Yang, Qi Wang, Haotian Liu, Haizhou Hua, Wenchuan Wu</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.</p>

            <p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm to do capacity expansion planning (CAPEX) under weather uncertainty. When faced with multiple possible weather years, the quality of a CAPEX solution derived on a single year's data is evaluated across all years, and the CAPEX optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back--up capacity to overcome periods of (cold) dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered weather years for an increase of 1.6-2.9% in total annual cost compared to initial solutions. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time--series, including dark lull and cold period effects.</p>

            <p>This study proposes optimized Type-I and Type-II fuzzy controllers for automotive suspension systems to enhance ride comfort and stability under road disturbances (step/sine inputs), addressing the lack of systematic performance comparisons in existing literature. We integrate Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to tune controller parameters for a quarter car model, with emphasis on BBO's underexplored efficacy. MATLAB Simulink simulations demonstrate that BBO-optimized Type-II fuzzy control reduces body displacement by 22% and acceleration by 18% versus baseline methods under step disturbances, while maintaining computational efficiency. The framework provides practical, high-performance solutions for modern vehicles, particularly electric and autonomous platforms where vibration attenuation and energy efficiency are critical.</p>

            <h2>SLENet: A Novel Multiscale CNN-Based Network for Detecting the Rats Estrous Cycle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinyang Wang, Hoileong Lee, Xiaodi Pu, Yuanming Lai, Yiming Ma</p>
            <p>In clinical medicine, rats are commonly used as experimental subjects. However, their estrous cycle significantly impacts their biological responses, leading to differences in experimental results. Therefore, accurately determining the estrous cycle is crucial for minimizing interference. Manually identifying the estrous cycle in rats presents several challenges, including high costs, long training periods, and subjectivity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a classification network-Spatial Long-distance EfficientNet (SLENet). This network is designed based on EfficientNet, specifically modifying the Mobile Inverted Bottleneck Convolution (MBConv) module by introducing a novel Spatial Efficient Channel Attention (SECA) mechanism to replace the original Squeeze Excitation (SE) module. Additionally, a Non-local attention mechanism is incorporated after the last convolutional layer to enhance the network's ability to capture long-range dependencies. The dataset used 2,655 microscopic images of rat vaginal epithelial cells, with 531 images in the test set. Experimental results indicate that SLENet achieved an accuracy of 96.31%, outperforming baseline EfficientNet model (94.2%). This finding provide practical value for optimizing experimental design in rat-based studies such as reproductive and pharmacological research, but this study is limited to microscopy image data, without considering other factors like temporal patterns, thus, incorporating multi-modal input is necessary for future application.</p>

            <h2>Multisession Longitudinal Dynamic MRI Incorporating Patient-Specific Prior Image Information Across Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingjia Chen, Hersh Chandarana, Daniel K. Sodickson, Li Feng</p>
            <p>Serial Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exams are often performed in clinical practice, offering shared anatomical and motion information across imaging sessions. However, existing reconstruction methods process each session independently without leveraging this valuable longitudinal information. In this work, we propose a novel concept of longitudinal dynamic MRI, which incorporates patient-specific prior images to exploit temporal correlations across sessions. This framework enables progressive acceleration of data acquisition and reduction of scan time as more imaging sessions become available. The concept is demonstrated using the 4D Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel (GRASP) MRI, a state-of-the-art dynamic imaging technique. Longitudinal reconstruction is performed by concatenating multi-session time-resolved 4D GRASP datasets into an extended dynamic series, followed by a low-rank subspace-based reconstruction algorithm. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method. Results show that longitudinal 4D GRASP reconstruction consistently outperforms standard single-session reconstruction in image quality, while preserving inter-session variations. The approach demonstrated robustness to changes in anatomy, imaging intervals, and body contour, highlighting its potential for improving imaging efficiency and consistency in longitudinal MRI applications. More generally, this work suggests a new context-aware imaging paradigm in which the more we see a patient, the faster we can image.</p>

            <h2>Wardropian Cycles make traffic assignment both optimal and fair by eliminating price-of-anarchy with Cyclical User Equilibrium for compliant connected autonomous vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Hoffmann, Michał Bujak, Grzegorz Jamróz, Rafał Kucharski</p>
            <p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations. We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</p>

            <h2>Coverage Probability and Average Rate Analysis of Hybrid Cellular and Cell-free Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuoyin Dai, Jingran Xu, Xiaoli Xu, Ruoguang Li, Yong Zeng, Jiangbin Lyu</p>
            <p>Cell-free wireless networks deploy distributed access points (APs) to simultaneously serve user equipments (UEs) across the service region and are regarded as one of the most promising network architectural paradigms. Despite recent advances in the performance analysis and optimization of cellfree wireless networks, it remains an open question whether large-scale deployment of APs in existing wireless networks can cost-effectively achieve communication capacity growth. Besides, the realization of a cell-free network is considered to be a gradual long-term evolutionary process in which cell-free APs will be incrementally introduced into existing cellular networks, and form a hybrid communication network with the existing cellular base stations (BSs). Such a collaboration will bridge the gap between the established cellular network and the innovative cellfree network. Therefore, hybrid cellular and cell-free networks (HCCNs) emerge as a practical and feasible solution for advancing cell-free network development, and it is worthwhile to further explore its performance limits. This paper presents a stochastic geometry-based hybrid cellular and cell-free network model to analyze the distributions of signal and interference and reveal their mutual coupling. Specifically, in order to benefit the UEs from both the cellular BSs and the cell-free APs, a conjugate beamforming design is employed, and the aggregated signal is analyzed using moment matching. Then, the coverage probability of the hybrid network is characterized by deriving the Laplace transforms and their higher-order derivatives of interference components. Furthermore, the average achievable rate of the hybrid network over channel fading is derived based on the interference coupling analysis.</p>

            <p>The use of drones in a wide range of applications is steadily increasing. However, this has also raised critical security concerns such as unauthorized drone intrusions into restricted zones. Therefore, robust and accurate drone detection and classification mechanisms are required despite significant challenges due to small size of drones, low-altitude flight, and environmental noise. In this letter, we propose a multi-modal approach combining radar and acoustic sensing for detecting and classifying drones. We employ radar due to its long-range capabilities, and robustness to different weather conditions. We utilize raw acoustic signals without converting them to other domains such as spectrograms or Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. This enables us to use fewer number of parameters compared to the stateof-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of the transformer encoder architecture in fusing these sensors. Experimental results obtained in outdoor settings verify the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p>AI-enabled wireless communications have attracted tremendous research interest in recent years, particularly with the rise of novel paradigms such as low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Within these systems, feature engineering plays a pivotal role by transforming raw wireless data into structured representations suitable for AI models. Hence, this paper offers a comprehensive investigation of feature engineering techniques in AI-driven wireless communications. Specifically, we begin with a detailed analysis of fundamental principles and methodologies of feature engineering. Next, we present its applications in wireless communication systems, with special emphasis on ISAC networks. Finally, we introduce a generative AI-based framework, which can reconstruct signal feature spectrum under malicious attacks in low-altitude ISAC networks. The case study shows that it can effectively reconstruct the signal spectrum, achieving an average structural similarity index improvement of 4%, thereby supporting downstream sensing and communication applications.</p>

            <h2>Dependability Theory-based Statistical QoS Provisioning of Fluid Antenna Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irfan Muhammad, Priyadarshi Mukherjee, Wee Kiat New, Hirley Alves, Ioannis Krikidis, Kai-Kit Wong</p>
            <p>Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have recently emerged as a promising technology for next-generation wireless networks, offering real-time spatial reconfiguration to enhance reliability, throughput, and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, existing studies often overlook the temporal dynamics of channel fading and their implications for mission-critical operations. In this paper, we propose a dependability-theoretic framework for statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning of FAS under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. Specifically, we derive new closed-form expressions for the level-crossing rate (LCR) and average fade duration (AFD) of an $N$-port FAS over Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. Leveraging these second-order statistics, we define two key dependability metrics such as mission reliability and mean time-to-first-failure (MTTFF), to quantify the probability of uninterrupted operation over a defined mission duration. We further extend the classical effective capacity (EC) concept to incorporate mission reliability in the FBL regime, yielding a mission EC (mEC). To capture energy efficiency under bursty traffic and latency constraints, we also develop the mission effective energy efficiency (mEEE) metric and formulate its maximization as a non-convex fractional optimization problem. This problem is then solved via a modified Dinkelbach's method with an embedded line search. Extensive simulations uncover critical trade-offs among port count, QoS exponent, signal-to-noise ratio, and mission duration, offering insights for the design of ultra-reliable, low-latency, and energy-efficient industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) systems.</p>

            <h2>DOA Estimation via Optimal Weighted Low-Rank Matrix Completion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed Razavikia, Mohammad Bokaei, Arash Amini, Stefano Rini, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel method for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) for a non-uniform and sparse linear sensor array using the weighted lifted structure low-rank matrix completion. The proposed method uses a single snapshot sample in which a single array of data is observed. The method is rooted in a weighted lifted-structured low-rank matrix recovery framework. The method involves four key steps: (i) lifting the antenna samples to form a low-rank stature, then (ii) designing left and right weight matrices to reflect the sample informativeness, (iii) estimating a noise-free uniform array output through completion of the weighted lifted samples, and (iv) obtaining the DOAs from the restored uniform linear array samples. We study the complexity of steps (i) to (iii) above, where we analyze the required sample for the array interpolation of step (iii) for DOA estimation. We demonstrate that the proposed choice of weight matrices achieves a near-optimal sample complexity. This complexity aligns with the problem's degree of freedom, equivalent to the number of DOAs adjusted for logarithmic factors. Numerical evaluations show the proposed method's superiority against the non-weighted counterpart and atomic norm minimization-based methods. Notably, our proposed method significantly improves, with approximately a 10 dB reduction in normalized mean-squared error over the non-weighted method at low-noise conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darío Slaifstein (1), Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli (1), Laura Ramirez-Elizondo (1), Pavol Bauer (1) ((1) Delft University of Technology)</p>
            <p>The operation of residential energy hubs with multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to different carrier dynamics, hybrid storage coordination and high-dimensional action-spaces. Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the set points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage economic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including physics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The hierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In particular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and continuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage systems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day auctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no intra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to follow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the winter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation. Finally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the thermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by static battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market (LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness improves through emergent cooperation among agents.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Mean Field Framework for Aggregators Participating in Wholesale Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun He, Andrew L. Liu</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.</p>

            <h2>Should Top-Down Clustering Affect Boundaries in Unsupervised Word Discovery?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Malan, Benjamin van Niekerk, Herman Kamper</p>
            <p>We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection. However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor. Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project code repository: this https URL.</p>

            <p>Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly spearheading recent advances on a variety of tasks that fall under the purview of computer audition -- the use of machines to understand sounds. They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily-available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community, and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose foundation models for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines towards auditory foundation models. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models, and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.</p>

To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot, multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity. Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect consistency, and audio quality.</p>

            <h2>An Explainable Equity-Aware P2P Energy Trading Framework for Socio-Economically Diverse Microgrid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijan Theja, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants. Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles, which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access. This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt, continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair energy communities.</p>

            <h2>Approximating CCCV charging using SOC-dependent tapered charging power constraints in long-term microgrid planning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Zahid Butt, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Traditional long-term microgrid planning models assume constant power charging for battery energy storage systems (BESS), overlooking efficiency losses that occur toward the end of charge due to rising internal resistance. While this issue can be mitigated at the cell level using constant current-constant voltage (CCCV) charging, it is impractical at the pack level in large-scale systems. However, battery management systems and inverter controls can emulate this effect by tapering charging power at high state-of-charge (SOC) levels, trading off charging speed for improved efficiency and reduced thermal stress. Ignoring this behavior in planning models can lead to undersized batteries and potential reliability issues. This paper proposes a tractable and scalable approach to approximate CCCV behavior using SOC-dependent tapered charging power (TCP) constraints. A MATLAB-based proof of concept demonstrates the energy delivery and efficiency benefits of tapering. The method is integrated into a long-term planning framework and evaluated under a synthetic load and solar profile. Results show tapering significantly affects BESS sizing, cost, and reliability under dynamic operating conditions that demand fast charging. These findings highlight tapering as a critical modeling factor for accurately capturing BESS performance in long-term microgrid planning.</p>

So, modified non dominated sorting genetic algorithm, is developed and presented to solve this multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm examined by application to two distribution feeders of the Tabriz distribution network containing the third feeder of the Azar substation with a distributed generation unit and first and third feeders of ElGoli substation which form a double feed feeder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Falchi, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt</p>
            <p>Power-electronics-based converters are being considerably employed through the power system to interconnect multiple heterogeneous electrical layers. Furthermore, the intrinsic versatility to play with the converter network topology is widely exploited to accommodate a certain number of terminals and ports according with the specific application. On this regard, several converter arrangements can be encountered in power applications. Moreover, to properly establish both the operation and the control, the so-called degrees of freedom (DOFs) need to be assessed per each converter topology. On this matter, similarly to the well-known Clarke transformation, which clearly reveals the DOFs for the star-based topology system, further similar transformations can be achieved to depict the independent set of variables characterizing a certain converter structure. Referring to the cell-based class of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) topologies, including Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); this article proposes a general methodology to determine the change of variable matrix transformation for several converter arrangements which are related to complete bi-partite and multi-partite graphs. The methodology lies in the graph Laplacian spectral analysis, which remarks the structural normal modes at the converter points of connections. Furthermore, for a complete characterization, the instantaneous power patterns formulations, based on the DOFs, are also introduced.</p>

Unlike traditional approaches based on the Average System Frequency (ASF) model, this method captures the true system dynamics and avoids oversimplified representations. The dominant modes exhibit low sensitivity to system parameters, enabling robust and accurate estimations across diverse operating conditions. The proposed approach is tested on two benchmark systems as well as the Salvadoran transmission planning network, demonstrating its scalability, precision, and adaptability. This methodology represents a shift from observing a simplified average system frequency response to a more detailed analysis focusing on system dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Gutierrez-Florensa, Alvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Collision-free Control Barrier Functions for General Ellipsoids via Separating Hyperplane</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeming Wu, Lu Liu</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel collision avoidance method for general ellipsoids based on control barrier functions (CBFs) and separating hyperplanes. First, collision-free conditions for general ellipsoids are analytically derived using the concept of dual cones. These conditions are incorporated into the CBF framework by extending the system dynamics of controlled objects with separating hyperplanes, enabling efficient and reliable collision avoidance. The validity of the proposed collision-free CBFs is rigorously proven, ensuring their effectiveness in enforcing safety constraints. The proposed method requires only single-level optimization, significantly reducing computational time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Numerical simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p>Amidst the growing demand for implementing advanced control and decision-making algorithms|to enhance the reliability, resilience, and stability of power systems|arises a crucial concern regarding the safety of employing machine learning techniques. While these methods can be applied to derive more optimal control decisions, they often lack safety assurances. This paper proposes a framework based on control barrier functions to facilitate safe learning and deployment of reinforcement learning agents for power system control applications, specifically in the context of automatic generation control. We develop the safety barriers and reinforcement learning framework necessary to establish trust in reinforcement learning as a safe option for automatic generation control - as foundation for future detailed verification and application studies.</p>

            <h2>Carbon Emission Flow Tracing: Fast Algorithm and California Grid Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqing Shen, Yuanyuan Shi, Daniel Kirschen, Yize Chen</p>
            <p>Power systems decarbonization are at the focal point of the clean energy transition. While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data, our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission analysis for every California county. Both our algorithm and the California study are open-sourced, providing a foundation for future research on grid emissions, planning, operations, and energy policy.</p>

            <h2>Towards Microgrid Resilience Enhancement via Mobile Power Sources and Repair Crews: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wang, Dawei Qiu, Fei Teng, Goran Strbac</p>
            <p>Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event. However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in load restoration.</p>

            <h2>Regional Frequency-Constrained Planning for the Optimal Sizing of Power Systems via Enhanced Input Convex Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wang, Goran Strbac</p>
            <p>Large renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced levels of system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. There have been plenty of studies developing frequency-constrained models for power system security. However, most existing literature only considers uniform frequency security, while neglecting frequency spatial differences in different regions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel planning model for the optimal sizing problem of power systems, capturing regional frequency security and inter-area frequency oscillations. Specifically, regional frequency constraints are first extracted via an enhanced input convex neural network (ICNN) and then embedded into the original optimisation for frequency security, where a principled weight initialisation strategy is adopted to deal with the gradient vanishing issues of non-negative weights in traditional ICNNs and enhance its fitting ability. An adaptive genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search is developed to separate the planning model into two stages and effectively solve it iteratively. Case studies have been conducted on three different power systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-constrained planning model in ensuring regional system security and obtaining realistic investment decisions.</p>

            <h2>Two-Stage TSO-DSO Services Provision Framework for Electric Vehicle Coordination</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Wang, Dawei Qiu, Fei Teng, Goran Strbac</p>
            <p>High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for frequency service and voltage support.</p>

            <h2>Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors with Reactivity Decline</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiny Choudhury, Michael Davidson, George Tynan</p>
            <p>Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible, baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping limits. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and the associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing xenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent subsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This work introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds fuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related constraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core conditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional onset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior. When applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of operation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. The results show that fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling is critical for accurate scheduling of nuclear reactors and offers a tractable pathway to integrate nuclear power in energy system models.</p>

            <h2>Stability Constrained Voltage Control in Distribution Grids with Arbitrary Communication Infrastructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyi Yuan, Jie Feng, Yuanyuan Shi, Jorge Cortés</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.</p>

            <p>We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p>

            <p>Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been open-sourced.</p>

            <p>Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are envisioned as two essential and interconnected functions in sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. On the one hand, sensing-empowered applications rely on powerful AI models to extract features and understand semantics from ubiquitous wireless sensors. On the other hand, the massive amount of sensory data serves as the fuel to continuously refine edge AI models. This deep integration of sensing and edge AI has given rise to a new task-oriented paradigm known as integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), which features a holistic design approach to communication, AI computation, and sensing for optimal sensing-task performance. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey for ISEA. We first provide technical preliminaries for sensing, edge AI, and new communication paradigms in ISEA. Then, we study several use cases of ISEA to demonstrate its practical relevance and introduce current standardization and industrial progress. Next, the design principles, metrics, tradeoffs, and architectures of ISEA are established, followed by a thorough overview of ISEA techniques, including digital air interface, over-the-air computation, and advanced signal processing. Its interplay with various 6G advancements, e.g., new physical-layer and networking techniques, are presented. Finally, we present future research opportunities in ISEA, including the integration of foundation models, convergence of ISEA and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), ultra-low-latency ISEA, and practicality issues.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Bai, Karl Henrik Johansson, Jonas Mårtensson, Andreas A. Malikopoulos</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the benefit allocation in a mixed-energy truck platoon composed of fuel-powered and electric trucks. The interactions among trucks during platoon formation are modeled as a coalitional game with transferable utility. We first design a stable payoff allocation scheme that accounts for truck heterogeneity in energy savings and platoon roles (leader or follower), establishing core-stability conditions to ensure that no subset of trucks has an incentive to deviate for greater benefit. To enhance payoff fairness, we then propose a closed-form, Shapley value-based allocation approach that is computationally efficient and independent of the platoon size. Sufficient conditions under which the allocation is both fair and core-stable are provided. In scenarios where the Shapley value falls outside the core, we develop an alternative allocation based on the stable payoff that minimizes the mean relative deviation from the Shapley value while preserving core stability. This deviation is further proved to be upper-bounded by $1$, showing a favorable trade-off between stability and fairness. Finally, extensive numerical studies validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facilitating stable, equitable, and sustainable cooperation in mixed-energy truck platooning.</p>

            <p>Faced with increasing penetration of distributed energy resources and fast development of distribution grid energy management, topology identification of distribution grid becomes an important and fundamental task. As the underlying grid topology is usually unknown or incomplete to the utilities, it is becoming a fundamental task to efficiently identify the distribution grid network topology using limited measurements. A fast and accurate topology identification can help achieving the tasks of load monitoring, operation and control of power distribution system as well as outage detection. In this paper, we propose a novel and ultra-fast topology identification method. By adapting the subset sum method with a hierarchical structure, the overall grid topology can be inferred from fewer samples of smart meter power measurements. Such techniques can be applied in real time under the scenarios with fast topology change, and the proposed hierarchical algorithm is also robust against measurement noises.</p>

            <p>The growing adoption of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has introduced unprecedented dynamics in power systems, resulting in oscillations across a broad spectrum of frequencies. Communication delay between the plant-level control and the inverter-level control in IBR plants has been recognized as one of the causes of such oscillations and a factor that impacts the system's stability. The control signals from the plant-level controller also experience sampling, with the sampled values held constant by the hold elements for the duration of the sampling period. This also has a bearing on the response of IBR plants. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of communication delay and sampling of control signals between plant-level control and inverter-level control of grid-following IBR plants on the small-signal stability of power systems. The underlying fundamentals of communication delay and sampling are revisited to explain the observed responses. Our findings emphasize the unique effects of communication delay and sampling period on the stability of IBR-rich power systems and suggest strategies to mitigate their detrimental impacts. The work also highlights the need for more accurate approaches for small-signal stability analysis of such systems.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a transient stability-driven planning framework for the optimal sizing problem of resilient AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) under different types of contingencies, capturing frequency and voltage stability requirements as well as the frequency-voltage coupling dynamics of AC/DC interlinking converters (ICs). The planning model is formulated into a defender-attacker-defender (DAD) architecture, which can be further merged into two levels, i.e., upper-level and low-level problems, and then iteratively solved by an enhanced genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search. Regarding the operation stage, a novel transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) algorithm is proposed for static and transient operations of HMGs, capturing governor dynamics and automatic voltage regulator of conventional generators as well as the droop control dynamics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) for frequency control and voltage control, respectively. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimisation approach is developed to capture the time-coupling property of energy storages (ESs) and then allow the TSC-OPF to be solved on an hourly basis with a second-scale resolution, achieving the co-optimisation of static and transient stability requirements. Case studies have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning framework in obtaining cost-effective investment decisions for various resources while respecting transient stability requirements under different contingencies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.</p>

            <p>Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and electrification of energy systems necessitates the engagement of demand-side management (DSM) to help alleviate congestion in electricity grid. Heat pump and thermal energy storage (HPTES) systems, being energy efficient solutions, are becoming popular in modern buildings and are promising to contribute to demand-side management (DSM) due to their significant share in household electricity consumption. For typical HPTES systems, this paper presents a systematic design framework covering a control-oriented modeling process and energy-flexible model predictive control (MPC) design. The proposed MPC-based DSM strategy offers an innovative solution for efficient DSM by following a two-step DSM framework. In the first step, flexibility assessment is performed to quantitatively evaluate the flexibility potential of the HPTES system by solving a mixed-integer economic MPC problem. In the second step, flexibility exploitation is achieved through reacting to feasible demand response (DR) requests while respecting system constraints. Both numerical simulations and real-world experiments are performed based on a real HPTES installation to showcase the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</p>

            <p>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has significantly increased demand on both transportation and power systems, posing challenges to their stable operation. To support the growing need for EV charging, both fixed charging stations (FCSs) and mobile charging stations (MCSs) have been introduced, serving as key interfaces between the power grid and traffic network. Recognizing the importance of collaborative planning across these sectors, this paper presents a two-stage joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, utilizing an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The primary goal of the proposed model is to transform the potential negative impacts of large-scale EV integration into positive outcomes, thereby enhancing social welfare through collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In the first stage, we develop a framework for evaluating FCS locations, incorporating assessments of EV hosting capacity and voltage stability. The second stage introduces a joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, aiming to minimize the overall social costs of the EV charging system while maintaining a reliable power supply. To solve the planning problem, we employ a combination of mixed-integer linear programming, queueing theory, and sequential quadratic programming. The improved ADMM algorithm couples the siting and sizing decisions consistently by introducing coupling constraints, and supports a distributed optimization framework that coordinates the interests of EV users, MCS operators, and distribution system operators. Additionally, a flexible capacity planning strategy that accounts for the multi-period development potential of EVCS is proposed to reduce both the complexity and the investment required for FCS construction. Finally, a case study with comparative experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models and solution methods.</p>

            <h2>Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted mmWave Systems via Diffusion Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Wang, Yin Xu, Cixiao Zhang, Zhiyong Chen, Mingzeng Dai, Haiming Wang, Bingchao Liu, Dazhi He, Meixia Tao</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising technology for next-generation wireless communications. However, the performance of RIS-assisted systems critically depends on accurate channel state information (CSI). To address this challenge, this letter proposes a novel channel estimation method for RIS-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems based on diffusion models (DMs). Specifically, the forward diffusion process of the original signal is formulated to model the received signal as a noisy observation within the framework of DMs. Subsequently, the channel estimation task is formulated as the reverse diffusion process, and a sampling algorithm based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) is developed to enable effective inference. Furthermore, a lightweight neural network, termed BRCNet, is introduced to replace the conventional U-Net, significantly reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. Extensive experiments conducted under various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines.</p>

            <h2>RIS-aided Latent Space Alignment for Semantic Channel Equalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomás Hüttebräucker, Mario Edoardo Pandolfo, Simone Fiorellino, Emilio Calvanese Strinati, Paolo Di Lorenzo</p>
            <p>Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.</p>

            <h2>Fast Feeder Reconfiguration via Mesh Adaptive Direct Search in Black-Box Distribution System Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyuan Zheng, Wenlong Shi, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Feeder reconfiguration is a critical operational strategy in power distribution systems. However, existing optimization approaches typically rely on explicit mathematical formulations and analytical models, which are often infeasible in practical utility environments characterized by heterogeneous, proprietary, and black-box simulation modules. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fast feeder reconfiguration framework based on Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). The proposed approach requires only performance metric evaluations through simulation modules used for power flow, protection, and voltage regulation analysis. A bi-objective formulation is adopted to jointly minimize active power loss and operational constraint violations. A Pareto-based frontier filter is integrated into the MADS algorithm to efficiently guide the search toward high-quality configurations while systematically pruning dominated solutions. The approach adaptively refines the search space around promising candidates using local polling strategies and convergence aware updates. Case studies on the IEEE-123 node test feeder demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal configurations with significantly fewer evaluations compared to heuristic methods.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a general framework to evaluate power system strength. The formulation features twelve indicators, grouped in three dynamical orders, that quantify the resistance of bus voltage phasors and their first and second order rates of change to sudden current injection changes. To quantify such changes the paper introduces a novel finite differentiation technique, that we named Delta operator, able to properly capture "jumps" of algebraic variables and utilizes the recently developed concept of complex frequency. The paper also shows how the proposed framework can be systematically applied to any system device, and provides a variety of examples based on synchronous machines, converters and loads models are given.

            <h2>Arbitrage Tactics in the Local Markets via Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyang Zhang, Mina Montazeri, Philipp Heer, Koen Kok, Nikolaos G. Paterakis</p>
            <p>Strategic bidding tactics employed by prosumers in local markets, including the Local Electricity Market (LEM) and Local Flexibility Market (LFM), have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance economic benefits for market participants through optimized energy management and bidding. While existing research has explored strategic bidding in a single market with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, arbitrage opportunities across local markets remain unexplored. This paper introduces a hierarchical MARL (HMARL) algorithm designed to enable aggregator arbitrage across multiple local markets. The strategic behavior of these aggregators in local markets is modeled as a two-stage Markov game: the first stage involves the LEM, while the second stage encompasses both the LFM and the balancing market. To solve this two-stage Markov game, the HMARL framework assigns two sub-agents to each aggregator, a primary sub-agent and a secondary sub-agent. Without the arbitrage strategy, these sub-agents operate in silos, with the primary sub-agent focusing on first-stage profits and the secondary sub-agent on second-stage profits, each employing independent MARLs. On the contrary, when implementing the arbitrage strategy with the proposed HMARL, the sub-agents communicate and coordinate to perform arbitrage across multiple local markets, enhancing overall efficiency. The case study, conducted under a scenario where all aggregators employ the arbitrage strategy, shows that despite higher initial costs in the LEM, this strategy generates substantial savings in the LFM and the balancing market, resulting in a total profit increase of $40.6\%$ on average. This highlights the capability of the proposed HMARL to address the two-stage Markov game and facilitate arbitrage across local markets, thereby enhancing profitability for participants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong-Xing Zheng, Xinji Wang, Xin Chen, Di Mao, Jia Shi, Cunhua Pan, Chongwen Huang, Haiyang Ding, Zan Li</p>
            <p>This paper investigates a multi-user uplink mobile edge computing (MEC) network, where the users offload partial tasks securely to an access point under the non-orthogonal multiple access policy with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) against a multi-antenna eavesdropper. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem of minimizing the total energy consumption subject to secure offloading requirement, and we build an efficient block coordinate descent framework to iteratively optimize the number of local computation bits and transmit power at the users, the RIS phase shifts, and the multi-user detection matrix at the access point. Specifically, we successively adopt successive convex approximation, semi-definite programming, and semidefinite relaxation to solve the problem with perfect eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), and we then employ S-procedure and penalty convex-concave to achieve robust design for the imperfect CSI case. We provide extensive numerical results to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate that RIS plays a significant role in realizing a secure and energy-efficient MEC network, and deploying a well-designed RIS can save energy consumption by up to 60\% compared to that without RIS. We further reveal impacts of various key factors on the secrecy energy efficiency, including RIS element number and deployment position, user number, task scale and duration, and CSI imperfection.</p>

            <h2>Multi-RIS-Empowered Communication Systems: Capacity Analysis and Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aris L. Moustakas, George C. Alexandropoulos</p>
            <p>In this chapter, using statistical physics methods, asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are presented. While nominally valid in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.</p>

            <h2>Integrating and Comparing Radiality Constraints for Optimized Distribution System Reconfiguration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Cortes, Alejandra Tabares, Fredy Franco</p>
            <p>The reconfiguration of electrical power distribution systems is a crucial optimization problem aimed at minimizing power losses by altering the system topology through the operation of interconnection switches. This problem, typically modelled as a mixed integer nonlinear program demands high computational resources for large scale networks and requires specialized radiality constraints for maintaining the tree like structure of distribution networks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis that integrates and compares the computational burden associated with different radiality constraint formulations proposed in the specialized literature for the reconfiguration of distribution systems. By using consistent hardware and software setups, we evaluate the performance of these constraints across several well known test cases. Our findings reveal significant differences in computational efficiency depending on the chosen set of radiality constraints, providing valuable insights for optimizing reconfiguration strategies in practical distribution networks.</p>

            <h2>Heatwave-driven air conditioning adoption could increase German electricity demand by 14 GW in the near future</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Semmelmann, Frederik vom Scheidt</p>
            <p>Intensifying heatwaves driven by climate change are accelerating the adoption of mobile air conditioning (AC) systems. A rapid mass adoption of such AC systems could create additional stress on electricity grids and the power system. This study presents a novel method to estimate the electricity demand from AC systems both at system level and at high temporal and spatial granularity. We apply the method to a near-future heatwave scenario in Germany in which household AC adoption increases from current 19% to 35% during a heatwave similar to the one of July 2025. We analyze the effects for 196,428 grid cells of one square kilometer across Germany, by combining weather data, census data, socio-demographic assumptions, mobility patterns, and temperature-dependent AC activation functions. We find that electricity demand of newly purchased mobile AC systems could increase the peak load by over 14 GW (23%), with urban hot-spots reaching 5.8 MW per square kilometer. The temporal pattern creates a pronounced afternoon peak that coincides with lower photovoltaic generation, potentially exacerbating power system stability challenges. Our findings underscore the urgency for proactive energy system planning to manage emerging demand peaks.</p>

            <h2>Smart fault detection in satellite electrical power system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niloofar Nobahari, Alireza Rezaee</p>
            <p>This paper presents an new approach for detecting in the electrical power system of satellites operating in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) without an Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS). Components of these systems are prone to faults, such as line-to-line faults in the photovoltaic subsystem, open circuits, and short circuits in the DC-to-DC converter, as well as ground faults in batteries. In the previous research has largely focused on detecting faults in each components, such as photovoltaic arrays or converter systems, therefore, has been limited attention given to whole electrical power system of satellite as a whole system. Our approach addresses this gap by utilizing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model, which leverages input data such as solar radiation and surface temperature to predict current and load outputs. These machine learning techniques that classifiy use different approaches like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to classify faults effectively. The model presented achieves over 99% accuracy in identifying faults across multiple subsystems, marking a notable advancement from previous approaches by offering a complete diagnostic solution for the entire satellite power system. This thorough method boosts system reliability and helps lower the chances of mission failure</p>

            <h2>Solving Optimal Power Flow on a Data-Budget: Feature Selection on Smart Meter Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vassilis Kekatos, Ridley Annin, Manish K. Singh, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>How much data is needed to optimally schedule distributed energy resources (DERs)? Does the distribution system operator (DSO) have to know load demands at each bus of the feeder to solve an optimal power flow (OPF)? This work exploits redundancies in OPF's structure and data to minimize the communication of such a data deluge, and explores the trade-off between data compression and the grid's performance. We propose an OPF data distillation framework involving two steps: The DSO first collects OPF data from only a subset of nodes. It subsequently reconstructs the complete OPF data from the partial ones, and feeds them into the OPF solver. Selecting and reconstructing OPF data may be performed to maximize the fidelity of the reconstructed data or the associated OPF solutions. Under the first objective, OPF data distillation is posed as a sparsity-regularized convex problem. Under the second objective, it is posed as a sparsity-regularized bilevel program. Both problems are solved using proximal gradient algorithms. The second objective is superior in approximating OPF solutions at the expense of increased complexity. Numerical tests show that it enhances the fidelity and feasibility of the reconstructed OPF solutions, which can be approximated reasonably well even from partial data.</p>

            <p>With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads, losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv) thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making, ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Bai, Salish Maharjan, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Black start (BS) of the distribution system (DS) with high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) requires advanced control frameworks to ensure secure and efficient restoration. This paper proposes a model predictive black start (MPBS) framework incorporating an inrush current feasibility module to dynamically generate real-time feasible and optimal restoration sequences. Short-term forecasts of DER output and transmission grid (TG) availability are utilized to construct adaptive cranking paths. The inrush current feasibility module analytically estimates the transient inrush current caused by energizing no-load distribution transformers (DTs). To mitigate excessive inrush current and avoid potential misoperations of protection devices, an emergency operation-inspired voltage control strategy and a switch blocking mechanism are developed. The proposed inrush model is validated against electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations in PowerFactory with estimation accuracies exceeding 90 %. Case studies on a modified IEEE 123-node feeder demonstrate that the MPBS framework prevents misoperations of fuses and reclosers, reduces unnecessary DER energy consumption, and enhances load restoration efficiency during DER-led BS processes.</p>

            <p>Accurate short-term electricity price forecasting is crucial for strategically scheduling demand and generation bids in day-ahead markets. While data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22% and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3) respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs, and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.</p>

By reformulating the conventional virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) problem, the framework uses early predictions of post-fault dynamics to proactively redispatch resources, ensuring the system's center of inertia remains stable under worst-case contingencies. Validated on the IEEE 39-bus system with 70% IBR penetration, the proposed approach prevents system collapse where a conventional VIS strategy fails, ensuring frequency stability at a cost increase of only 5%.</p>

In this study a generalized stability analysis method for LV AC microgrids, composed of droop controlled inverters, is presented. The proposed analysis method is based on the inclusion of dynamic phasors for inductive coupling lines into the existing phasors based stability analysis method.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ding Lin, Jianhui Wang, Tianqiao Zhao, Meng Yue</p>
            <p>Transmission switching is a well-established approach primarily applied to minimize operational costs through strategic network reconfiguration. However, exclusive focus on cost reduction can compromise system reliability. While multi-objective transmission switching can balance cost savings with reliability improvements, feasible solutions become exceedingly difficult to obtain as system scale grows, due to the inherent nonlinearity and high computational demands involved. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for multi-objective transmission switching. The method incorporates a dueling-based actor-critic framework to evaluate the relative impact of each line switching decision within the action space, which improves decision quality and enhances both system reliability and cost efficiency. Numerical studies on the IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to two benchmark DRL algorithms.</p>

The results demonstrate that connecting more batteries in series through reconfigurability in battery packs can significantly reduce charging times while maintaining operational safety.

            <h2>Embracing Fairness in Consumer Electricity Markets using an Automatic Market Maker</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaun Sweeney, Chris King, Mark O'Malley, Robert Shorten</p>
            <p>As consumer flexibility becomes expected, it is important that the market mechanisms which attain that flexibility are perceived as fair. We set out fairness issues in energy markets today, and propose a market design to address them. Consumption is categorised as either essential or flexible with different prices and reliability levels for each. Prices are generated by an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) based on instantaneous scarcity and resource is allocated using a novel Fair Play algorithm. We empirically show the performance of the system over 1 year for 101 UK households and benchmark its performance against more classical approaches.</p>
