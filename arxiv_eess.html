            <h2>Sensitivity of DC Network Representation for GIC Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddh Mishra, Arthur K. Barnes, Jose E. Tabarez, Adam Mate</p>
            <p>Geomagnetic disturbances are a threat to the reliability and security of our national critical energy infrastructures. These events specifically result in geomagnetically induced currents, which can cause damage to transformers due to magnetic saturation. In order to mitigate these effects, blocker devices must be placed in optimal locations. Finding this placement requires a dc representation of the ac transmission lines, which this paper discusses. Different decisions in this process, including the method of representing the blocking devices, result in significant variations to the power loss calculations. To analyze these effects, we conclude the paper by comparing the losses on a sample network with different modeling implementations.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation of Voltage Unbalance Metrics in Distribution Networks with High DER Penetration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez</p>
            <p>Voltage unbalance, caused by variations in voltage magnitude and phase angle, is a significant power quality issue in three-phase systems, leading to equipment inefficiencies and increased system losses. The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) into the grid adds complexity, as DER can either reduce or worsen voltage unbalance, depending on factors such as grid configuration and the distribution of loads and DER themselves. This study explores the effects of DER penetration on voltage unbalance levels and the accuracy of the different indices most commonly used to quantify this unbalance. The results highlight the varying impacts of DER on unbalance and index performance, emphasizing the need for effective strategies to assess voltage unbalance in modern distribution systems.</p>

            <h2>PGLearn -- An Open-Source Learning Toolkit for Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Klamkin, Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.

            <h2>Constraints and Variables Reduction for Optimal Power Flow Using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Virtual Node-Splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thuan Pham, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Power system networks are often modeled as homogeneous graphs, which limits the ability of graph neural network (GNN) to capture individual generator features at the same nodes. By introducing the proposed virtual node-splitting strategy, generator-level attributes like costs, limits, and ramp rates can be fully captured by GNN models, improving GNN's learning capacity and prediction accuracy. Optimal power flow (OPF) problem is used for real-time grid operations. Limited timeframe motivates studies to create size-reduced OPF (ROPF) models to relieve the computational complexity. In this paper, with virtual node-splitting, a novel two-stage adaptive hierarchical GNN is developed to (i) predict critical lines that would be congested, and then (ii) predict base generators that would operate at the maximum capacity. This will substantially reduce the constraints and variables needed for OPF, creating the proposed ROPFLG model with reduced monitor lines and reduced generator-specific variables and constraints. Two ROPF models, ROPFL and ROPFG, with just reduced lines or generators respectively, are also implemented as additional benchmark models. Case studies show that the proposed ROPFLG consistently outperforms the benchmark full OPF (FOPF) and the other two ROPF methods, achieving significant computational time savings while reliably finding optimal solutions.</p>

            <h2>Geometry of the Feasible Output Regions of Grid-Interfacing Inverters with Current Limits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lauren Streitmatter, Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>Many resources in the grid connect to power grids via programmable grid-interfacing inverters that can provide grid services and offer greater control flexibility and faster response times compared to synchronous generators. However, the current through the inverter needs to be limited to protect the semiconductor components. Existing controllers are designed using somewhat ad hoc methods, for example, by adding current limiters to preexisting control loops, which can lead to stability issues or overly conservative operations. In this paper, we study the geometry of the feasible output region of a current-limited inverter. We show that under a commonly used model, the feasible region is convex. We provide an explicit characterization of this region, which allows us to efficiently find the optimal operating points of the inverter. We demonstrate how knowing the feasible set and its convexity allows us to improve upon existing grid-forming inverters such that their steady-state currents always remain within the current magnitude limit, whereas standard grid-forming controllers can lead to instabilities and violations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alif Ahmed, Minhajur Rahman, Mohammad Jawad Chowdhury, Khandakar Abdulla Al Mamun</p>
            <p>The growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates the development of efficient and reliable charging infrastructure, particularly fast charging stations (FCS) for addressing challenges such as range anxiety and long charging times. This paper presents the design and feasibility analysis of a grid-connected DC fast charging station for the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, a critical transportation corridor in Bangladesh. The proposed system incorporates advanced components, including a step-down transformer, Vienna Rectifier, and LC filter, to convert high-voltage AC power from the grid into a stable DC output. Simulated using MATLAB Simulink, the model delivers a peak output of 400V DC and 120 kW power, enabling rapid and efficient EV charging. The study also evaluates the system's performance, analyzing charging times, energy consumption, and distance ranges for representative EVs. By addressing key technical, environmental, and economic considerations, this paper provides a comprehensive roadmap for deploying fast charging infrastructure, fostering EV adoption, and advancing sustainable transportation in Bangladesh.</p>

            <h2>Large Language Models for Solving Economic Dispatch Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sina Mohammadi, Ali Hassan, Rouzbeh Haghighi, Van-Hai Bui, Wencong Su</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the capability of off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) to solve the economic dispatch (ED) problem. ED is a hard-constrained optimization problem solved on a day-ahead timescale by grid operators to minimize electricity generation costs while accounting for physical and engineering constraints. Numerous approaches have been proposed, but these typically require either mathematical formulations, face convergence issues, or depend on extensive labeled data and training time. This work implements LLMs enhanced with reasoning capabilities to address the classic lossless ED problem. The proposed approach avoids the need for explicit mathematical formulations, does not suffer from convergence challenges, and requires neither labeled data nor extensive training. A few-shot learning technique is utilized in two different prompting contexts. The IEEE 118-bus system with 19 generation units serves as the evaluation benchmark. Results demonstrate that various prompting strategies enable LLMs to effectively solve the ED problem, offering a convenient and efficient alternative. Consequently, this approach presents a promising future solution for ED tasks, particularly when foundational power system models are available.</p>

            <h2>Online distributed optimization for spatio-temporally constrained real-time peer-to-peer energy trading</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>The proliferation of distributed renewable energy triggers the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market formations. To make profits, prosumers equipped with photovoltaic (PV) panels and even the energy storage system (ESS) can actively participate in the real-time P2P energy market and trade energy. However, in real situations, system states such as energy demands and renewable energy power generation are highly uncertain, making it difficult for prosumers to make optimal real-time decisions. Moreover, severe problems with the physical network can arise from the real-time P2P energy trading, such as bus voltage violations and line overload. To handle these problems, this work first formulates the real-time P2P energy trading problem as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints. To deal with the uncertainties online, a modified Lyapunov optimization method is innovatively proposed to approximately reformulate the stochastic optimization problem into an online one by relaxing the time-coupling constraints. Compared with the state-of-the-art online methods, the proposed one renders more flexibility and better performance for the real-time P2P energy market operation. Additionally, to protect the prosumers' privacy, an online distributed algorithm based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve the reformulated online problem by decoupling the spatial constraints. The theoretical near-optimal performance guarantee of the proposed online distributed algorithm is derived, and its performance can be further improved by minimizing the performance gap. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed online distributed algorithm can guarantee the fast, stable, and safe long-term operation of the real-time P2P energy market.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Pursue AC Optimal Power Flow Solutions with Feasibility Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damola Ajeyemi, Yiting Chen, Antonin Colot, Jorge Cortes, Emiliano Dall'Anese</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on an AC optimal power flow (OPF) problem for distribution feeders equipped with controllable distributed energy resources (DERs). We consider a solution method that is based on a continuous approximation of the projected gradient flow - referred to as the safe gradient flow - that incorporates voltage and current information obtained either through real-time measurements or power flow computations. These two setups enable both online and offline implementations. The safe gradient flow involves the solution of convex quadratic programs (QPs). To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a novel framework that employs a neural network approximation of the optimal solution map of the QP. The resulting method has two key features: (a) it ensures that the DERs' setpoints are practically feasible, even for an online implementation or when an offline algorithm has an early termination; (b) it ensures convergence to a neighborhood of a strict local optimizer of the AC OPF. The proposed method is tested on a 93-node distribution system with realistic loads and renewable generation. The test shows that our method successfully regulates voltages within limits during periods with high renewable generation.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Taheri, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</p>

            <h2>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Control of Autonomous Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manan Tayal, Aditya Singh, Shishir Kolathaya, Somil Bansal</p>
            <p>As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</p>

            <h2>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part I: Computing with Microwave Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>Analog computing has been recently revived due to its potential for energy-efficient and highly parallel computations. In this two-part paper, we explore analog computers that linearly process microwave signals, named microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs), and their applications in signal processing and communications. In Part I of this paper, we model a MiLAC as a multiport microwave network with tunable impedance components, enabling the execution of mathematical operations by reconfiguring the microwave network and applying input signals at its ports. We demonstrate that a MiLAC can efficiently compute the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator and matrix inversion, with remarkably low computational complexity. Specifically, a matrix can be inverted with complexity growing with the square of its size. We also show how a MiLAC can be used jointly with digital operations to implement sophisticated algorithms such as the Kalman filter. To enhance practicability, we propose a design of MiLAC based on lossless impedance components, reducing power consumption and eliminating the need for costly active components. In Part II of this paper, we investigate the applications of MiLACs in wireless communications, highlighting their potential to enable future wireless systems by executing computations and beamforming in the analog domain.</p>

            <h2>Analog Computing for Signal Processing and Communications -- Part II: Toward Gigantic MIMO Beamforming</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Nerini, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>Analog-domain operations offer a promising solution to accelerating signal processing and enabling future multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with thousands of antennas. In Part I of this paper, we have introduced a microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) as an analog computer that processes microwave signals linearly, demonstrating its potential to reduce the computational complexity of specific signal processing tasks. In Part II of this paper, we extend these benefits to wireless communications, showcasing how MiLAC enables gigantic MIMO beamforming entirely in the analog domain. MiLAC-aided beamforming enables the maximum flexibility and performance of digital beamforming, while significantly reducing hardware costs by minimizing the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and only relying on low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs). In addition, it eliminates per-symbol operations by completely avoiding digital-domain processing and remarkably reduces the computational complexity of zero-forcing (ZF), which scales quadratically with the number of antennas instead of cubically. It also processes signals with fixed matrices, e.g., the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), directly in the analog domain. Numerical results show that it can perform ZF and DFT with a computational complexity reduction of up to $1.5\times 10^4$ and $4.0\times 10^7$ times, respectively, compared to digital beamforming.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic Control Improves Residential Building Energy and EV Management when PV Capacity is High but Battery Capacity is Low</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Ullner, Alona Zharova, Felix Creutzig</p>
            <p>Efficient energy management in prosumer households is key to alleviating grid stress in an energy transition marked by electric vehicles (EV), renewable energies and battery storage. However, it is unclear how households optimize prosumer EV charging. Here we study real-world data from 90 households on fixed-rate electricity tariffs in German-speaking countries to investigate the potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and other control approaches (Rule-Based, Model Predictive Control) to manage the dynamic and uncertain environment of Home Energy Management (HEM) and optimize household charging patterns. The DRL agent efficiently aligns charging of EV and battery storage with photovoltaic (PV) surplus. We find that frequent EV charging transactions, early EV connections and PV surplus increase optimization potential. A detailed analysis of nine households (1 hour resolution, 1 year) demonstrates that high battery capacity facilitates self optimization; in this case further algorithmic control shows little value. In cases with relatively low battery capacity, algorithmic control with DRL improves energy management and cost savings by a relevant margin. This result is further corroborated by our simulation of a synthetic household. We conclude that prosumer households with optimization potential would profit from DRL, thus benefiting also the full electricity system and its decarbonization.</p>

            <h2>Byzantine-Resilient Distributed P2P Energy Trading via Spatial-Temporal Anomaly Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>Distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading mandates an escalating coupling between the physical power network and communication network, necessitating high-frequency sharing of real-time data among prosumers. However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Fei Teng, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. {The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhong Liu, Qinfei Long, Rong-Peng Liu, Wenjie Liu, Xin Cui, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers' volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.</p>

            <p>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has increased the importance of demand response in smart grids. This paper proposes a two-layer demand response optimization framework for EV users and aggregators, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to balance electricity supply and demand and optimize energy utilization during EV charging. The upper-layer model, focusing on the aggregator, aims to maximize profits by adjusting retail electricity prices. The lower-layer model targets EV users, using LLMs to simulate charging demands under varying electricity prices and optimize both costs and user comfort. The study employs a multi-threaded LLM decision generator to dynamically analyze user behavior, charging preferences, and psychological factors. The framework utilizes the PSO method to optimize electricity prices, ensuring user needs are met while increasing aggregator profits. Simulation results show that the proposed model improves EV charging efficiency, alleviates peak power loads, and stabilizes smart grid operations.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Joint Radar and Communication in Disaster Scenarios</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmet Burak Ozyurt, Shreesh Mohalik, John S. Thompson</p>
            <p>With the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, there is a necessity for advanced technologies that can provide reliable situational awareness and communication. Conventional systems are often inadequate due to unreliable infrastructure, power grid failures, high investment costs and scalability challenges. This paper explores the potential of ad-hoc mesh joint radar and communication (JRC) networks as a scalable, resilient, energy-efficient solution for disaster management that can operate independently of conventional infrastructure. The proposed JRC network enhances disaster response by integrating target detection (such as identifying vital signs, hazardous leaks, and fires) with communication capabilities to ensure efficient information dissemination under intense clutter conditions. Key performance metrics, including data rate, Signal-to-Clutter and Noise Ratio (SCNR), probability of detection, and false alarm rate, are used to assess performance. An optimization approach is proposed to provide an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. The results show the performance of ad-hoc mesh JRC systems, underscoring their potential to enhance disaster management efforts by addressing unique operational challenges.</p>

            <h2>Quasi Steady-State Frequency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Gutierrez-Florensa, Alvaro Ortega, Lukas Sigrist, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>Accurate frequency estimation is critical for the control, monitoring and protection of electrical power systems, in particular, of systems with a high penetration of power electronics. This paper introduces the novel concept of Quasi Steady-State (QSS) frequency as a quantity that fills the gap between stationary and instantaneous frequency. QSS frequency coincides with the fundamental frequency of an AC voltage in any stationary conditions, including unbalanced and non-sinusoidal, and is able to capture the time-varying fundamental frequency in transient conditions. The paper also proposes a metric borrowed from fluid dynamics, namely, the time derivative of the circulation, to define the scope of validity of the QSS frequency. Analytical examples as well as a case study based on a fully-fledged EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system serve to illustrate, respectively, the properties of the QSS frequency and its behavior in transient conditions.</p>

            <h2>UAV-Enabled Secure ISAC Against Dual Eavesdropping Threats: Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianping Yao, Zeyu Yang, Zai Yang, Jie Xu, Tony Q. S. Quek</p>
            <p>In this work, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a UAV serves as an aerial base station (BS) to simultaneously perform communication with a user and detect a target on the ground, while a dual-functional eavesdropper attempts to intercept the signals for both sensing and communication. Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p>

            <h2>Load Forecasting in the Era of Smart Grids: Opportunities and Advanced Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurausp Maneshni</p>
            <p>Electric energy is difficult to store, requiring stricter control over its generation, transmission, and distribution. A persistent challenge in power systems is maintaining real-time equilibrium between electricity demand and supply. Oversupply contributes to resource wastage, while undersupply can strain the grid, increase operational costs, and potentially impact service reliability. To maintain grid stability, load forecasting is needed. Accurate load forecasting balances generation and demand by striving to predict future electricity consumption. This thesis examines and evaluates four machine learning frameworks for short term load forecasting, including gradient boosting decision tree methods such as Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). A hybrid framework is also developed. In addition, two recurrent neural network architectures, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are designed and implemented. Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied to assess the relationships between electricity demand and exogenous variables. The experimental results show that, for the specific dataset and forecasting task in this study, machine learning-based models achieved improved forecasting performance compared to a classical ARIMA baseline.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithms for Energy Management Systems in Microgrids: A Control Strategy Based on a PHIL System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saiful Islam, Sanaz Mostaghim, Michael Hartmann</p>
            <p>In this research a real time power hardware in loop configuration has been implemented for an microgrid with the combination of distribution energy resources such as photovoltaic, grid tied inverter, battery, utility grid, and a diesel generator. This paper introduces an unique adaptive multi-objective optimization approach that employs weighted optimization techniques for real-time microgrid systems. The aim is to effectively balance various factors including fuel consumption, load mismatch, power quality, battery degradation, and the utilization of renewable energy sources. A real time experimental data from power hardware in loop system has been used for dynamically updating system states. The adaptive preference-based selection method are adjusted based on state of battery charging thresholds. The technique has been integrated with six technical objectives and complex constraints. This approach helps to practical microgrid decision making and optimization of dynamic energy systems. The energy management process were also able to maximize photovoltaic production where minimizing power mismatch, stabilizing battery state of charge under different condition. The research results were also compared with the baseline system without optimization techniques, and a reliable outcome was found.</p>

            <h2>Agent-Based Decentralized Energy Management of EV Charging Station with Solar Photovoltaics via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiarong Fan, Chenghao Huang, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of energy net zero within smart cities, transportation electrification plays a pivotal role. The adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) keeps increasing, making energy management of EV charging stations critically important. While previous studies have managed to reduce energy cost of EV charging while maintaining grid stability, they often overlook the robustness of EV charging management against uncertainties of various forms, such as varying charging behaviors and possible faults in faults in some chargers. To address the gap, a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach is proposed treating each charger to be an agent and coordinate all the agents in the EV charging station with solar photovoltaics in a more realistic scenario, where system faults may occur. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is incorporated in the MARL algorithm to extract temporal features from time-series. Additionally, a dense reward mechanism is designed for training the agents in the MARL algorithm to improve EV charging experience. Through validation on a real-world dataset, we show that our approach is robust against system uncertainties and faults and also effective in minimizing EV charging costs and maximizing charging service satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Customising Electricity Contracts at Scale with Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jochen L. Cremer</p>
            <p>The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLM) in chats at scale. The LLM-based chat has direct access to a model of the grid and studies the grid's technical constraints just as an expert engineer. The advantage of this system is that end-users can directly interact with grid models through natural language; no intermediate is needed to service, analyse, study, assess, advise, consult and engineer. This initial study paves the way toward developing this tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawn Virginillo, Asja Derviškadić, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>The expected decrease in system inertia and frequency stability motivates the development and maintenance of dynamic system models by Transmission System Operators. However, some dynamic model parameters can be unavailable due to market unbundling, or inaccurate due to aging infrastructure, non-documented tuning of controllers, or other factors. In this paper, we propose the use of a numerical approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (nFIM) for efficient inference of dynamic model parameters. Thanks to the proposed numerical implementation, the method is scalable to Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) models, which can quickly become computationally complex even for small study systems. Case studies show that the nFIM is coherent with parameter variances of single- and multi-parameter least-squares estimators when applied to an IEEE 9-bus dynamic model with artificial measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaolu Chen, Chenghao Huang, Yanru Zhang, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>With the proliferation of smart grids, smart cities face growing challenges due to cyber-attacks and sophisticated electricity theft behaviors, particularly in residential photovoltaic (PV) generation systems. Traditional Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrating multi-source data, limiting their effectiveness. In this work, we propose an efficient ETD method that accurately identifies fraudulent behaviors in residential PV generation, thus ensuring the supply-demand balance in smart cities. Our hybrid deep learning model, combining multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer, excels in capturing both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a data embedding technique that seamlessly integrates time-series data with discrete temperature variables, enhancing detection robustness. Extensive simulation experiments using real-world data validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in the accuracy of detecting sophisticated energy theft activities, thereby contributing to the stability and fairness of energy systems in smart cities.</p>

            <p>Discrete gradient methods are a powerful tool for the time discretization of dynamical systems, since they are structure-preserving regardless of the form of the total energy. In this work, we discuss the application of discrete gradient methods to the system class of nonlinear port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations - as they emerge from the port- and energy-based modeling of physical systems in various domains. We introduce a novel numerical scheme tailored for semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations and further address more general settings using the concepts of discrete gradient pairs and Dirac-dissipative structures. Additionally, the behavior under system transformations is investigated and we demonstrate that under suitable assumptions port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations admit a representation which consists of a parametrized port-Hamiltonian semi-explicit system and an unstructured equation. Finally, we present the application to multibody system dynamics and discuss numerical results to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach.</p>

            <p>ASVspoof challenges are designed to advance the understanding of spoofing speech attacks and encourage the development of robust countermeasure systems. These challenges provide a standardized database for assessing and comparing spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification solutions. The ASVspoof5 challenge introduces a shift in database conditions compared to ASVspoof2019. While ASVspoof2019 has mismatched conditions only in spoofing attacks in the evaluation set, ASVspoof5 incorporates mismatches in both bona fide and spoofed speech statistics. This paper examines the impact of these mismatches, presenting qualitative and quantitative comparisons within and between the two databases. We show the increased difficulty for genuine and spoofed speech and demonstrate that in ASVspoof5, not only are the attacks more challenging, but the genuine speech also shifts toward spoofed speech compared to ASVspoof2019.</p>

            <p>Text-to-video generation enhances content creation but is highly computationally intensive: The computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) scales quadratically in the number of pixels. This makes minute-length video generation extremely expensive, limiting most existing models to generating videos of only 10-20 seconds length. We propose a Linear-complexity text-to-video Generation (LinGen) framework whose cost scales linearly in the number of pixels. For the first time, LinGen enables high-resolution minute-length video generation on a single GPU without compromising quality. It replaces the computationally-dominant and quadratic-complexity block, self-attention, with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, combining a bidirectional Mamba2 block with our token rearrangement method, Rotary Major Scan, and our review tokens developed for long video generation. The TE-branch is a novel TEmporal Swin Attention block that focuses on temporal correlations between adjacent tokens and medium-range tokens. The MATE block addresses the adjacency preservation issue of Mamba and improves the consistency of generated videos significantly. Experimental results show that LinGen outperforms DiT (with a 75.6% win rate) in video quality with up to 15$\times$ (11.5$\times$) FLOPs (latency) reduction. Furthermore, both automatic metrics and human evaluation demonstrate our LinGen-4B yields comparable video quality to state-of-the-art models (with a 50.5%, 52.1%, 49.1% win rate with respect to Gen-3, LumaLabs, and Kling, respectively). This paves the way to hour-length movie generation and real-time interactive video generation. We provide 68s video generation results and more examples in our project website: this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Control of Renewable Energy Communities using AI and Real-World Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Fonseca, Clarisse Sousa, Ricardo Venâncio, Pedro Pires, Ricardo Severino, Paulo Rodrigues, Pedro Paiva, Luis Lino Ferreira</p>
            <p>The electrification of transportation and the increased adoption of decentralized renewable energy generation have added complexity to managing Renewable Energy Communities (RECs). Integrating Electric Vehicle (EV) charging with building energy systems like heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), photovoltaic (PV) generation, and battery storage presents significant opportunities but also practical challenges. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly MultiAgent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithms, have shown promising results in simulation, outperforming heuristic control strategies. However, translating these successes into real-world deployments faces substantial challenges, including incomplete and noisy data, integration of heterogeneous subsystems, synchronization issues, unpredictable occupant behavior, and missing critical EV state-of-charge (SoC) information. This paper introduces a framework designed explicitly to handle these complexities and bridge the simulation to-reality gap. The framework incorporates EnergAIze, a MADDPG-based multi-agent control strategy, and specifically addresses challenges related to real-world data collection, system integration, and user behavior modeling. Preliminary results collected from a real-world operational REC with four residential buildings demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, achieving an average 9% reduction in daily peak demand and a 5% decrease in energy costs through optimized load scheduling and EV charging behaviors. These outcomes underscore the framework's effectiveness, advancing the practical deployment of intelligent energy management solutions in RECs.</p>

            <h2>A Dynamic Phasor Framework for Analysis of Grid-Forming Converter Connected to Series-Compensated Line</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fiaz Hossain, Nilanjan Ray Chaudhuri</p>
            <p>A dynamic phasor (DP) framework for time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of grid-forming converters (GFCs) connected to series-compensated transmission lines is proposed. The proposed framework can capture the behavior of GFCs subjected to unbalanced short circuit faults in presence of different current limiting strategies. Moreover, the linearizability and time invariance of this framework allows us to perform eigen decomposition, which is a powerful tool for root-cause analysis and control design. We show that a certain degree of series compensation may result in poorly-damped oscillations in presence of the grid-forming converter. A participation factor analysis using the DP model reveals that the point of interconnection voltage angle is dominant in this mode. Eigenvalue sensitivity analysis of controller parameters shows that reducing the power-frequency droop coefficient is most effective in stabilizing the poorly-damped mode. Detailed validation with electromagnetic transient model demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed framework.</p>

            <p>This paper deals with the secure Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problem in situations where the TSO is forced to accept the risk that some contingencies may result in the de-energization of parts of the grid to avoid the violation of operational limits. This operational policy, which mainly applies to subtransmission systems, is first discussed. Then, a model of that policy is proposed that complements the classical MILP model of the N-1 secure OTS problem. It comprises a connectivity and notably a partial grid loss analysis for branch outage contingencies. Finally, its application to the IEEE 14-bus system is presented. Solutions similar to those observed in operation are reached by the algorithm, notably revealing the preventive-openings-cascade phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoran Li, Muhao Guo, Yang Weng, Marija Ilic, Guangchun Ruan</p>
            <p>Non-stationary power system dynamics, influenced by renewable energy variability, evolving demand patterns, and climate change, are becoming increasingly complex. Accurately capturing these dynamics requires a model capable of adapting to environmental factors. Traditional models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), lack efficient mechanisms to encode external factors, such as time or environmental data, for dynamic adaptation. To address this, we propose the External Adaptive RNN (ExARNN), a novel framework that integrates external data (e.g., weather, time) to continuously adjust the parameters of a base RNN. ExARNN achieves this through a hierarchical hypernetwork design, using Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDE) to process external data and generate RNN parameters adaptively. This approach enables ExARNN to handle inconsistent timestamps between power and external measurements, ensuring continuous adaptation. Extensive forecasting tests demonstrate ExARNN's superiority over established baseline models.</p>

            <p>The widespread use of sensors in modern power grids has led to the accumulation of large amounts of voltage and current waveform data, especially during fault events. However, the lack of labeled datasets poses a significant challenge for fault classification and analysis. This paper explores the application of unsupervised clustering techniques for fault diagnosis in high-voltage power systems. A dataset provided by the Reseau de Transport d'Electricite (RTE) is analyzed, with frequency domain features extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The K-Means algorithm is then applied to identify underlying patterns in the data, enabling automated fault categorization without the need for labeled training samples. The resulting clusters are evaluated in collaboration with power system experts to assess their alignment with real-world fault characteristics. The results demonstrate the potential of unsupervised learning for scalable and data-driven fault analysis, providing a robust approach to detecting and classifying power system faults with minimal prior assumptions.</p>

            <p>This study introduces the Adiabatic Quantum Power Flow (AQPF) and Adiabatic Quantum Optimal Power Flow (AQOPF) algorithms to solve power flow (PF) and optimal power flow (OPF) problems, respectively. These algorithms utilize a novel combinatorial optimization reformulation of classical PF and OPF problems, and hence, enable their implementation on Ising machines, e.g., quantum and quantum-inspired hardware. The experiments are conducted on standard test cases ranging from 4-bus to 1354-bus systems, using D-Wave's Advantage system (QA), D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver (HA), Fujitsu's Digital Annealer V3 (DAv3), and Fujitsu's Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization software (QIIO). The annealers are systematically evaluated based on: (i) full and partitioned formulations, (ii) ability to handle ill-conditioned cases, and (iii) scalability. The results are benchmarked against the Newton-Raphson numerical method (NR) and suggest that AQPF and AQOPF can serve as effective solvers or complementary tools to classical methods to address unsolved challenges in large-scale modern power systems.</p>

In the proposed framework, prosumers, the DSO, and the local market operator (LMO) are the participating agents.

The proposed model is based on a modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method with two outer and inner loops; the outer loop models the interactions between the LMO and prosumers, while the inner loop addresses the interactions between the LMO and the DSO.

            <h2>Scalable and Efficient Aggregation of Energy-Constrained Flexible Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julie Rousseau, Philipp Heer, Kristina Orehounig, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Loads represent a promising flexibility source to support the integration of renewable energy sources, as they may shift their energy consumption over time. By computing the aggregated flexibility of power and energy-constrained loads, aggregators can communicate the group's flexibility without sharing individual private information. However, this computation is, in practice, challenging. Some studies suggest different inner approximations of aggregated flexibility polytopes, but all suffer from large computational costs for realistic load numbers and horizon lengths. In this paper, we develop a novel approximation of the aggregated flexibility of loads based on the concept of worst-case energy dispatch, i.e., if aggregated energy consumptions are assumed to be dispatched in the worst manner possible. This leads to conservative piecewise linear bounds that restrict the aggregated energy consumption only based on the previous aggregated energy consumed. A comparative case study reveals that our method can compute an approximation of the aggregation of thousands of loads efficiently, while displaying an accuracy comparable to other approximation techniques.</p>

            <p>As non-dispatchable renewable power units become prominent in electric power grids, demand-side flexibility appears as a key element of future power systems' operation. Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8°C higher and 3.4°C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p>

            <p>The rising demand of computing power leads to the installation of a large number of Data Centers (DCs). Their Fault-Ride-Through (FRT) behavior and their unique power characteristics, especially for DCs catered to Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, pose a threat to the stability of power systems. To ensure its stability, it is required accurate models of the loads involved. Here we propose a dynamic load model that properly captures the behaviour of DCs. Its three most defining features are the use of an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) which sits between the server load and the grid, the cooling load represented by an induction motor, and a pulsing load that represents the transients caused by contemporary DCs with significant AI workloads. The features of the proposed model and its impact on the dynamic performance of transmission systems are illustrated through a model of the all-island Irish transmission system and real-world data of the DCs currently connected to this system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjad Maleki, E. Veronica Belmaga, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana</p>
            <p>The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</p>

            <h2>A Risk-Based Probabilistic Transient Stability Approach for Ranking of Circuit Breakers in a Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umair Shahzad</p>
            <p>Power systems are getting more complex than ever and are consequently operating close to their limit of stability. Moreover, with the increasing demand of renewable wind generation, and the requirement to maintain a secure power system, the importance of transient stability cannot be overestimated. Current deterministic industry practices of transient stability assessment ignore the probability of variables involved. With increasing system uncertainties and widespread electricity market deregulation, there is a strong inevitability to incorporate probabilistic transient stability analysis. Circuit breakers play a critical role in fault clearing and consequently in determining the system transient stability. It is important that they undergo timely and appropriate maintenance procedures based on some criterion. Considering the need of incorporating risk in modern power systems, this paper proposes a risk-based probabilistic transient stability approach for ranking of circuit breakers in a power system. A novel priority index was proposed to rank the circuit breakers based on the system transient stability risk. DIgSILENT PowerFactory software was used to conduct the required simulations on IEEE 14 bus system. The proposed risk-based framework was deemed to be efficient in identification of the circuit breakers based on their priority rank index which can aid in power system planning process.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Wind Generation on Risk-based Security Assessment of Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umair Shahzad</p>
            <p>The electric power system is one of the largest and most intricate infrastructures. Therefore, it is critical to assess and maintain its security. A power system security assessment is indispensable for identifying post-contingency issues, taking corrective measures, and protecting the system from blackouts. This paper examined the impact of wind generation on the risk-based security assessment of a power transmission network in the context of planning. DIgSILENT PowerFactory software was used to conduct the analysis using a combination of the brute force technique and the nonsequential Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method on the IEEE 39-bus transmission test system. Optimal power flow (OPF) was used to quantify security, considering (N-1), (N-2), and (N-3) line outages and an (N-1) bus outage. Moreover, the average cost deviation from the mean optimal system operating cost was proposed as a novel security indicator. The results obtianed accurately depicted the effects of changing wind generation levels on system security in terms of risk. The most and least critical line(s) and bus in the system, for different wind generation levels, were also determined. Moreover, the worst-case wind-generation threshold level using two different cost functions for wind was identified.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Oelhaf, Georg Kordowich, Changhun Kim, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Andreas Maier, Johann Jager, Siming Bayer</p>
            <p>Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection. This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.</p>

            <h2>Distributionally Robust Planning of Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids for Sea Islands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Dong, Zhengsong Lu, Xiaoyu Cao, Zhengwen He, Tanveer Hossain Bhuiyan, Bo Zeng</p>
            <p>This paper presents a distributionally robust planning method for hydrogen-electrical microgrids over islands, where the cross-island energy exchange is supported by a maritime hydrogen transport network. This planning problem is complicated due to heterogeneous off-shore wind-driven uncertainties (i.e., renewable power, transport availability, demand fluctuations, and grid faulting), a subset of which exhibit endogenous uncertainty, as they can be affected by proactive measures (e.g., grid hardening) or infrastructure investment. To capture these features, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed considering decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), which encompasses variation of the underlying distributional ambiguity due to the change of the first stage decisions. Notably, the complete recourse property is missing, which is often neglected in existing DRO studies. Nevertheless, different from the case for land-based microgrids, this issue is critical and fundamental for sea island systems due to their particular physical and logistical requirements. To address these issues, we develop a C&CG algorithm that is customized with strong cutting planes to handle DRO with a varying DDU ambiguity set and feasibility requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and resilience of the proposed planning framework, along with the nontrivial improvements of the algorithm in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>Integration of renewable resources is profoundly reshaping the dynamics of modern power systems. This study shows that the voltage dynamics of power systems with multiple grid-forming (GFM) converters often enjoys a desirable property called input-output monotonicity. A systematic approach for computing the derivatives of the voltage subsystem is presented first, which provides insight into the structural characteristics of these models. Next, the sign pattern of the trajectory Jacobian matrix associated with the voltage subsystem is analyzed and revealed. The analysis indicates that the voltage dynamics of power systems often exhibits the so-called input-output monotonicity property. The theoretical results are then validated through several simulation examples, underscoring their practical implications.</p>

            <h2>Gaming Strategies in European Imbalance Settlement Mechanisms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Soroush Karimi Madahi, Kenneth Bruninx, Bert Claessens, Chris Develder</p>
            <p>Transmission System Operators (TSOs) rely on balancing energy provided by Balancing Service Providers (BSPs) to maintain the supply-demand balance in real time. Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) can simultaneously deviate from their day-ahead schedules in response to imbalance prices, e.g., by controlling flexible assets such as batteries. According to the European Electricity Balancing Guideline, these imbalance prices should incentivize BRPs performing such implicit or passive balancing to aid the TSO in restoring the energy balance. In this paper, we demonstrate that BRPs are unintentionally offered the opportunity to exploit gaming strategies in European imbalance settlement mechanisms. This is enabled by a disconnect between sub-quarter-hourly dynamics that determine the imbalance prices and the financial settlement on a quarter-hourly basis. We illustrate this behavior in a case study of the imbalance settlement mechanisms in Belgium and the Netherlands. Our results reveal that, in both countries, BRPs can, in theory, exploit the imbalance mechanism by increasing the instantaneous system imbalance during minutes within the quarter-hour that determine the imbalance price while still contributing to restoring the system balance for the rest of the quarter-hour.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deemah H. Tashman, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Walaa Hamouda</p>
            <p>In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach, the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizing Large-Scale Electric Power Grids with Adaptive Inertia</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Fritzsch, Philippe Jacquod</p>
            <p>The stability of AC power grids relies on ancillary services that mitigate frequency fluctuations. The electromechanical inertia of large synchronous generators is currently the only resource to absorb frequency disturbances on sub-second time scales. Replacing standard thermal power plants with inertialess new renewable sources of energy (NRE) therefore jeopardizes grid stability against e.g. sudden power generation losses. To guarantee system stability and compensate the lack of electromechanical inertia in grids with large penetrations of NREs, virtual synchronous generators, that emulate conventional generators, have been proposed. Here, we propose a novel control scheme for virtual synchronous generators, where the provided inertia is large at short times -- thereby absorbing faults as efficiently as conventional generators -- but decreases over a tunable time scale to prevent coherent frequency oscillations from setting in. We evaluate the performance of this adaptive inertia scheme under sudden power losses in large-scale transmission grids. We find that it systematically outperforms conventional, electromechanical inertia and that it is more stable than previously suggested schemes. Numerical simulations show how a quasi-optimal geographical distribution of adaptive inertia devices not only absorbs local faults efficiently, but also significantly increases the damping of inter-area oscillations. Our results show that the proposed adaptive inertia control scheme is an excellent solution to strengthen grid stability in future low-inertia power grids with large penetrations of NREs.</p>

            <h2>Non-Iterative Coordination of Interconnected Power Grids via Dimension-Decomposition-Based Flexibility Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Cheng Feng, Fengqi You</p>
            <p>The bulk power grid is divided into regional grids interconnected with multiple tie-lines for efficient operation. Since interconnected power grids are operated by different control centers, it is a challenging task to realize coordinated dispatch of multiple regional grids. A viable solution is to compute a flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid, then optimize the tie-line schedule using the aggregated models to implement non-iterative coordinated dispatch. However, challenges such as intricate interdependencies and curse of dimensionality persist in computing the aggregated models in high-dimensional space. Existing methods like Fourier-Motzkin elimination, vertex search, and multi-parameter programming are limited by dimensionality and conservatism, hindering practical application. This paper presents a novel dimension-decomposition-based flexibility aggregation algorithm for calculating the aggregated models of multiple regional power grids, enabling non-iterative coordination in large-scale interconnected systems. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach yields a significantly less conservative flexibility region. The derived flexibility aggregation model for each regional power grid has a well-defined physical counterpart, which facilitates intuitive analysis of multi-port regional power grids and provides valuable insights into their internal resource endowments. Numerical tests validate the feasibility of the aggregated model and demonstrate its accuracy in coordinating interconnected power grids.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Energy Consumption in Stochastic Production Systems: Using a Simulation-Based Approach for Stopping Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Balwin Bokor, Klaus Altendorfer, Andrea Matta</p>
            <p>In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing, this study introduces a Simulation-Based Approach (SBA) to model a stopping policy for energy-intensive stochastic production systems, developed and tested in a real-world industrial context. The case company - an energy-intensive lead-acid battery manufacturer - faces significant process uncertainty in its heat-treatment operations, making static planning inefficient. To evaluate a potential sensor-based solution, the SBA leverages simulated sensor data (using a Markovian model) to iteratively refine Bayesian energy estimates and dynamically adjust batch-specific processing times. A full-factorial numerical simulation, mirroring the company's 2024 heat-treatment process, evaluates the SBA's energy reduction potential, configuration robustness, and sensitivity to process uncertainty and sensor distortion. Results are benchmarked against three planning scenarios: (1) Optimized Planned Processing Times (OPT); (2) the company's Current Baseline Practice; and (3) an Ideal Scenario with perfectly known energy requirements. SBA significantly outperforms OPT across all tested environments and in some cases even performs statistically equivalent to an Ideal Scenario. Compared to the Current Baseline Practice, energy input is reduced by 14-25%, depending on uncertainty and sensor accuracy. A Pareto analysis further highlights SBA's ability to balance energy and inspection-labour costs, offering actionable insights for industrial decision-makers.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Power Fluctuations on Frequency Quality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angel Vaca, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper analyzes how power injections affect frequency quality in power systems. We first derive a general expression linking active and reactive power injections at buses to the system's frequency. This formulation explicitly considers both real and imaginary frequency components, providing a complete description of frequency behavior in power systems during transients. Next, we extend our analysis to incorporate stochastic variations of power injections. Using the frequency divider concept and power-based frequency estimation, we develop analytical relationships linking stochastic load fluctuations to frequency deviations. We discuss under which conditions the Central Limit Theorem cannot be applied to capture the frequency distribution, thereby clarifying how its hypotheses are not satisfied in power system applications. Then, we establish clear criteria for the appropriate use of statistical methods in frequency analysis. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through simulations on modified IEEE 14-bus and all-island Irish transmission test systems, highlighting the accuracy, practical utility, and limitations of our proposed formulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Wiest, Niklas Nolzen, Florian Baader, André Bardow, Stefano Moret</p>
            <p>Large uncertainties in the energy transition urge decision-makers to develop low-regret strategies, i.e., strategies that perform well regardless of how the future unfolds. To address this challenge, we introduce a decision-support framework that identifies low-regret strategies in energy system planning under uncertainty. Our framework (i) automatically identifies strategies, (ii) evaluates their performance in terms of regret, (iii) assesses the key drivers of regret, and (iv) supports the decision process with intuitive decision trees, regret curves and decision maps. We apply the framework to evaluate the optimal use of biomass in the transition to net-zero energy systems, considering all major biomass utilization options: biofuels, biomethane, chemicals, hydrogen, biochar, electricity, and heat. Producing fuels and chemicals from biomass performs best across various decision-making criteria. In contrast, the current use of biomass, mainly for low-temperature heat supply, results in high regret, making it a must-avoid in the energy transition.</p>

            <p>Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation leverages information from source MRI sequences to generate target modalities, enabling comprehensive diagnosis while overcoming the limitations of acquiring all sequences. While existing deep-learning-based multi-modal MRI translation methods have shown promising potential, they still face two key challenges: 1) lack of reliable uncertainty quantification for synthesized images, and 2) limited robustness when deployed across different medical centers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that reformulates multi-modal MRI translation as a multi-modal evidential regression problem with distribution calibration. Our approach incorporates two key components: 1) an evidential regression module that estimates uncertainties from different source modalities and an explicit distribution mixture strategy for transparent multi-modal fusion, and 2) a distribution calibration mechanism that adapts to source-target mapping shifts to ensure consistent performance across different medical centers. Extensive experiments on three datasets from the BraTS2023 challenge demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance and robustness across domains.</p>

            <p>The advantages and disadvantages of Battery Swapping Stations (BSS) for heavy-duty trucks are poorly understood, relative to Fast Charging Stations (FCS) systems. This study evaluates these two charging mechanisms for electric heavy-duty trucks, aiming to compare the systems' efficiency and identify their optimal design. A model was developed to address the planning and operation of BSS in a charging network, considering in-station batteries as assets for various services. We assess performance metrics including transportation efficiency and battery utilization efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that BSS significantly increased transportation efficiency by reducing vehicle downtime compared to fast charging, but may require more batteries. BSS with medium-sized batteries offers improved transportation efficiency in terms of time and labor. FCS-reliant trucks require larger batteries to compensate for extended charging times. To understand the trade-off between these two metrics, a cost-benefit analysis was performed under different scenarios involving potential shifts in battery prices and labor costs. Additionally, BSS shows potential for significant $\text{CO}_2$ emission reductions and increased profitability through energy arbitrage and grid ancillary services. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating BSS into future electric truck charging networks and adopting carbon-aware operational frameworks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zaid Ibn Mahmood, Hantao Cui, Ying Zhang</p>
            <p>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are a key component in the ongoing modernization of power systems, with grid-forming (GFM) inverters playing a central role. Effective fault current limiting is a major challenge to modernizing power systems through increased penetration of GFM inverters. Due to their voltage-source nature, GFM inverters offer no direct control over the output current and, therefore, are susceptible to high fault currents. This vulnerability is especially pronounced during large phase jumps, a condition overlooked by most fault current limiting methods. This paper proposes a hybrid fault current limiting method implemented through a virtual admittance by leveraging the advantages of two virtual impedance (VI)-based methods tailored for three-phase faults and phase jump disturbances. Electromagnetic transient simulations conducted in MATLAB-Simulink demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various disturbances, validating its potential in single-loop GFM structures.</p>

            <p>We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation, controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging strategies under realistic scenarios.</p>

            <p>Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability, resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon. Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge. We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models to generate yearly forecasts. Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.</p>

            <p>To optimize the dispatch of batteries, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory for a chosen open-loop power schedule to ensure admissibility (i.e., that schedule can be realized). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we develop a novel composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while guaranteeing admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and its disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Xia, Yihong Zhou, Iacopo Savelli, Thomas Morstyn</p>
            <p>In transmission expansion planning (TEP), network planners make long-term investment decisions while anticipating market clearing outcomes that are increasingly affected by renewable generation uncertainty. Additionally, market participants' sensitivity to network charges and the requirement for cost recovery by the network planner introduce further complexity. Since the day-ahead market clears before uncertainty realizes, explicitly modelling these uncertainties at the lower-level market clearing becomes important in bilevel TEP problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel bilevel TEP framework with lower-level joint chance-constrained market clearing that manages line flow constraints under wind uncertainty and accounts for the effect of network tariffs on participants' actual marginal costs and utility. To solve this complex problem, we propose a Strengthened Linear Approximation (SLA) technique for handling Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints with right-hand-side uncertainties (RHS-WDRJCC). The proposed method offers more efficient approximations without additional conservativeness and avoids the numerical issues encountered in existing approaches by introducing valid inequalities. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the desired out-of-sample constraint satisfaction probability. Moreover, the numerical results highlight the significant computational advantage of SLA, achieving up to a 26x speedup compared to existing methods such as worst-case conditional value-at-risk, while maintaining high solution quality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Tao, Wei Xu, Xiaohu You</p>
            <p>Optimization of user association in a densely deployed cellular network is usually challenging and even more complicated due to the dynamic nature of user mobility and fluctuation in user counts. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a promising solution, its application in practice is hindered by high trial-and-error costs in real world and unsatisfactory physical network performance during training. Also, existing DRL-based user association methods are typically applicable to scenarios with a fixed number of users due to convergence and compatibility challenges. To address these limitations, we introduce a large vision model (LVM)-enhanced digital twin (DT) for wireless networks and propose a parallel DT-driven DRL method for user association and load balancing in networks with dynamic user counts, distribution, and mobility patterns. To construct this LVM-enhanced DT for DRL training, we develop a zero-shot generative user mobility model, named Map2Traj, based on the diffusion model. Map2Traj estimates user trajectory patterns and spatial distributions solely from street maps. DRL models undergo training in the DT environment, avoiding direct interactions with physical networks. To enhance the generalization ability of DRL models for dynamic scenarios, a parallel DT framework is further established to alleviate strong correlation and non-stationarity in single-environment training and improve training efficiency. Numerical results show that the developed LVM-enhanced DT achieves closely comparable training efficacy to the real environment, and the proposed parallel DT framework even outperforms the single real-world environment in DRL training with nearly 20\% gain in terms of cell-edge user performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiancheng An, Mérouane Debbah, Tie Jun Cui, Zhi Ning Chen, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>Intelligent metasurfaces have demonstrated great promise in revolutionizing wireless communications. One notable example is the two-dimensional (2D) programmable metasurface, which is also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to manipulate the wireless propagation environment to enhance network coverage. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have been developed to substantially improve signal processing efficiency by directly processing analog electromagnetic signals in the wave domain. Another exciting breakthrough is the flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM), which possesses the ability to morph its 3D surface shape in response to dynamic wireless channels and thus achieve diversity gain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of these emerging intelligent metasurface technologies. We commence by examining recent experiments of RIS and exploring its applications from four perspectives. Furthermore, we delve into the fundamental principles underlying SIM, discussing relevant prototypes as well as their applications. Numerical results are also provided to illustrate the potential of SIM for analog signal processing. Finally, we review the state-of-the-art of FIM technology, discussing its impact on wireless communications and identifying the key challenges of integrating FIMs into wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Implicit Neural Representation of Waveform Measurements in Power Systems Waveform Data Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narges Ehsani, Vishwanath Saragadam, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad</p>
            <p>There is currently a paradigm shift in several power system monitoring applications, such as incipient fault detection and monitoring inverter-based resources, to transition from traditional phasor analytics to more informative waveform analytics. This paper contributes to this transition by developing a novel approach to modeling voltage and current waveform measurements using implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs are continuous function approximators that are recently used in vision and signal processing. The proposed INR models are specifically designed to meet the requirements of waveform analytics in power systems, such as by using sinusoidal activation functions that capture the periodic nature of voltage and current waveforms. We also propose extended models that can efficiently represent correlated waveforms, such as three-phase waveforms and synchro-waveforms. Real-world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed INR models in terms of accuracy (<1-2% MSE) and model size (4-6x compression). We also investigate the application of INR models in oscillation monitoring, for single mode oscillations and dual mode modulated oscillations.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Flexibility through Reduction Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Polina Alexeenko, Matthew Bruchon, Jesse Bennett</p>
            <p>While electric vehicles (EVs) often exhibit substantial flexibility, harnessing this flexibility requires precise characterization of its timing and magnitude. This paper introduces the reduction potential matrix, a novel approach to EV load flexibility modeling which is both straightforward to calculate and intuitive to interpret. This paper demonstrates the approach by quantifying flexibility for two distinct commercial vehicle groups--freight vehicles and transit buses--using simulated charging data from Virginia. While both groups are found to have substantial flexibility, its properties vary across the groups. Naturally, this variability manifests in differences in each group's role as a grid resource. The paper concludes with a discussion on how system planners, fleet operators, and other stakeholders can use the matrix to assess and leverage EV flexibility.</p>

            <h2>Improving Power Systems Controllability via Edge Centrality Measures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Muhammad Nadeem, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>Improving the controllability of power networks is crucial as they are highly complex networks operating in synchrony; even minor perturbations can cause desynchronization and instability. To that end, one needs to assess the criticality of key network components (buses and lines) in terms of their impact on system performance. Traditional methods to identify the key nodes/edges in power networks often rely on static centrality measures based on the network's topological structure ignoring the network's dynamic behavior. In this paper, using multi-machine power network models and a new control-theoretic edge centrality matrix (ECM) approach, we: (i) quantify the influence of edges (i.e., the line susceptances) in terms of controllability performance metrics, (ii) identify the most influential lines, and (iii) compute near-optimal edge modifications that improve the power network controllability. Employing various IEEE power network benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of the ECM-based algorithm and demonstrate improvements in system reachability, control, and damping performance.</p>

            <h2>ORIS allocation to minimize the outage probability in a multi-user VLC scenario</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Borja Genoves Guzman, Maïté Brandt-Pearce</p>
            <p>Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a promising solution to address the growing demand for wireless data, leveraging the widespread use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as transmitters. However, its deployment is challenged by link blockages that cause connectivity outages. Optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) have recently emerged as a solution to mitigate these disruptions. This work considers a multi-user VLC system and investigates the optimal association of ORISs to LEDs and users to minimize the outage probability while limiting the number of ORISs used. Numerical results from our proposed optimization algorithm demonstrate that using ORISs can reduce the outage probability by up to 85% compared to a no-ORIS scenario.</p>

            <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Multi-Stage Cascading Failure Mitigation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Meng, Chenghao Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>Cascading failures in power grids can lead to grid collapse, causing severe disruptions to social operations and economic activities. In certain cases, multi-stage cascading failures can occur. However, existing cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based, overlooking the complexity of the multi-stage scenario. This paper treats the multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.</p>

            <p>We consider the task of controlling a battery while balancing two competing objectives that evolve over different time scales. The short-term objective, such as arbitrage or load smoothing, improves with more battery cycling, while the long-term objective is to maximize battery lifetime, which discourages cycling. Using a semi-empirical aging model, we formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem. We use model predictive control (MPC) with a convex approximation of aging dynamics to optimally manage the trade-off between performance and degradation. Through simulations, we quantify this trade-off in both economic and smoothing applications.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dongsheng Sui, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Jiahua Wan, Liuchang Zhuo, Jing Jin, Qixing Wang, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>In this work, we aim to effectively characterize the performance of cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and to reveal how performance metrics relate to network parameters. To this end, we introduce a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment. Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on communication coverage probability and radar information rate. The analytical expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs) significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system in cooperative ISAC networks.</p>

            <h2>Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization with Self-Interference Mitigation in MA-ISAC System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Size Peng, Cixiao Zhang, Yin Xu, Qingqing Wu, Lipeng Zhu, Xiaowu Ou, Dazhi He</p>
            <p>Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</p>

            <p>Terahertz single-pixel imaging (TSPI) has garnered significant attention due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the relatively long wavelength of THz waves limits sub-diffraction-scale imaging resolution. Although TSPI technique can achieve sub-wavelength resolution, it requires harsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a sub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We illuminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back surface of a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited carriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a single-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively reconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625% under a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To further suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular spectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during propagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object, enabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\lambda}0/7 ({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.</p>

            <h2>Fault Detection Method for Power Conversion Circuits Using Thermal Image and Convolutional Autoencoder</h2>

            <p>A fault detection method for power conversion circuits using thermal images and a convolutional autoencoder is presented. The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions. The influence of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers and image augmentation conditions on anomaly detection accuracy was also investigated.</p>

            <p>Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions.

            <p>In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>This letter introduces a novel pinching-antenna-system (PASS) assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where multiple pinching antennas (PAs) are strategically activiated on a waveguide to facilitate information transmission to multiple information receivers (IRs) and power transfer to multiple energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously. Leveraging the single-waveguide architecture, non-orthogonal multiple access is employed to enable the superposed transmission of information signals, eliminating the need for dedicated energy carriers by concurrently serving both the IRs and the ERs. In this letter, an optimization problem is first formulated with an objective is to maximize the sum power received at the ERs via joint optimizing the IRs power allocation and the PAs positioning. Given the challenging non-convex nature of the formulated optimization problem, it is decoupled into two sub-problems which are solved alternatively. Specifically, the power allocation subproblem is recast a convex optimization problem, and hence can be solved efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a high-precision element-wise algorithm and a low-complexity linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the position optimization sub-problem. The numerical results demonstrate that PAs assisted SWIPT can achieve a remarkable performance gain compared to conventional system.</p>

            <p>Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment, contrasting with its efficiency goals.

This paper introduces DeltaDPD, exploring the dynamic temporal sparsity of input signals and neuronal hidden states in RNNs for energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW 256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03 dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Tong, Qin Wang, Aihong Tang</p>
            <p>Grid-forming, particularly those utilizing droop control and virtual synchronous generators (VSG), can actively regulate the frequency and voltage of microgrid systems, exhibiting dynamic characteristics akin to those of synchronous generators. Although droop control and VSG control each have distinct benefits, neither can fully meet the diverse, dynamic needs of both grid-connected (GC) and islanded (IS) modes. Additionally, the coupling between active and reactive power can negatively impact microgrids' dynamic performance and stability. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a unified dynamic power coupling (UDC) model. This model's active power control loop can be tailored to meet diverse requirements. By implementing a well-designed control loop, the system can harness the advantages of both droop control and VSG control. In islanded mode, the proposed model can provide virtual inertia and damping properties, while in grid-connected mode, the inverter's active power output can follow the changed references without significant overshoot or oscillation. Furthermore, the model incorporates coupling compensation and virtual impedance based on a relative gain array in the frequency domain to facilitate quantitative analysis of power coupling characteristics. This paper outlines a distinct design process for the unified model. Finally, the proposed control method has been validated through simulation.</p>

            <p>Power electronics converters are key enablers in the global energy transition for power generation, industrial and mobility applications; they convert electrical power in a controlled, reliable and efficient manner. The semiconductor switching devices, at the core of power converters, are the most likely component to fail due to the damage caused by the current-induced temperature cycling. Damage models of semiconductors have been developed and employed to study their reliability, improve their design and to estimate the lifetime of the converter in various power applications. However, those models can offer more if employed in the design of strategies to actively operate the converter. Specifically, properly controlling the current, and hence the temperature cycling, can effectively contribute to reducing the accumulated damage in the semiconductor and increase its reliability and lifetime. In this paper we propose a novel current control approach that integrates reliability requirements into the design framework, based on a frequency-domain model of the semiconductor damage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong-Peng Liu, Wei Sun, Dali Zhou, Yunhe Hou</p>
            <p>Integrated electricity and gas systems are constructed to facilitate the gas-fired generation, and the distributed operation of these integrated systems have received much attention due to the increased emphasis on data security and privacy between different agencies. This paper proposes an extended convex hull based method to address optimal energy flow problems for the integrated electricity and gas systems in a distributed manner. First, a multi-block electricity-gas system model is constructed by dividing the whole system into N blocks considering both physical and regional differences. This multi-block model is then convexified by replacing the nonconvex gas transmission equation with the extended convex hullbased constraints. The Jacobi-Proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is adopted to solve the convexified model and minimize its operation cost. Finally, the feasibility of the optimal solution for the convexified model is checked, and a sufficient condition is developed. If the sufficient condition is satisfied, the optimal solution for the original nonconvex problem can be recovered from that for the convexified problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is tractable and effective in obtaining feasible optimal solutions for multi-block optimal energy flow problems.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zeng, Xingwang Li, Ji Wang, Gaojian Huang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding</p>
            <p>The pinching-antenna architecture has emerged as a promising solution for reconfiguring wireless propagation environments and enhancing system performance. While prior research has primarily focused on sum-rate maximization or transmit power minimization of pinching-antenna systems, the critical aspect of energy efficiency (EE) has received limited attention. Given the increasing importance of EE in future wireless communication networks, this work investigates EE optimization in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted multi-user pinching-antenna uplink system. The problem entails the joint optimization of the users' transmit power and the pinching-antenna position. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex due to tightly coupled variables. To tackle this, we employ an alternating optimization framework to decompose the original problem into two subproblems: one focusing on power allocation and the other on antenna positioning. A low-complexity optimal solution is derived for the power allocation subproblem, while the pinching-antenna positioning subproblem is addressed using a particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a high-quality near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms both conventional-antenna configurations and orthogonal multiple access-based pinching-antenna systems in terms of EE.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyang Wang, Xin Chen</p>
            <p>The large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources presents significant challenges to maintaining power balance and nominal frequency in modern power systems. This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <p>Driven by the pursuit of gigabit-per-second data speeds for future 6G mobile networks, in addition to the support of sensing and artificial intelligence applications, the industry is expanding beyond crowded sub-6 GHz bands with innovative new spectrum allocations. In this paper, we chart a compelling vision for 6G within the frequency range 3 (FR3) spectrum, i.e. $7.125$-$24.25$ $\GHz$, by delving into its key enablers and addressing the multifaceted challenges that lie ahead for these new frequency bands. Here we highlight the physical properties of this \textcolor{black}{never-before} used spectrum by reviewing recent channel measurements for outdoor and indoor environments, including path loss, delay and angular spreads, and material penetration loss, all which offer insights that underpin future 5G/6G wireless communication designs. Building on the fundamental knowledge of the channel properties, we explore FR3 spectrum agility strategies that balance coverage and capacity (e.g. data rate) tradeoffs, while also examining coexistence with incumbent systems, such as satellites, radio astronomy, and earth exploration. Moreover, we discuss the potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output, compact and digital architectures, and evaluate the potential of multiband sensing for FR3 integrated sensing and communications. Finally, we outline 6G standardization features that are likely to emerge from 3GPP radio frame innovations and open radio access network developments.</p>

            <h2>Tight Finite Time Bounds of Two-Time-Scale Linear Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaan Ul Haque, Sajad Khodadadian, Siva Theja Maguluri</p>
            <p>Stochastic approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm for finding the fixed point of an operator using noisy samples and widely used in optimization and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The noise in RL exhibits a Markovian structure, and in some cases, such as gradient temporal difference (GTD) methods, SA is employed in a two-time-scale framework. This combination introduces significant theoretical challenges for analysis. We derive an upper bound on the error for the iterations of linear two-time-scale SA with Markovian noise. We demonstrate that the mean squared error decreases as $trace (\Sigma^y)/k + o(1/k)$ where $k$ is the number of iterates, and $\Sigma^y$ is an appropriately defined covariance matrix. A key feature of our bounds is that the leading term, $\Sigma^y$, exactly matches with the covariance in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the two-time-scale SA, and we call them tight finite-time bounds. We illustrate their use in RL by establishing sample complexity for off-policy algorithms, TDC, GTD, and GTD2. A special case of linear two-time-scale SA that is extensively studied is linear SA with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. We present tight finite time bounds corresponding to the covariance matrix of the CLT. Such bounds can be used to study TD-learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yufei Zhang (1), Andrew Sonta (1) ((1) ETHOS Lab, EPFL-ENAC-IIC)</p>
            <p>Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets. However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1 scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.</p>

            <p>Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids, providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS, namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability, data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of future AI-based EMS.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gholamreza Davarpanah, Sajjad Mohammadi</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a new class of permanent magnet-assisted three-phase switched reluctance motors (PM-SRMs) designed to achieve significantly higher torque density for electric vehicle (EV) propulsion systems. Eight distinct motor topologies are systematically investigated, including a non-PM baseline design, three innovative PM arrangement strategies, and two optimized rotor/stator teeth configurations (22-pole and 26-pole variants). The study presents analytical models including magnetic equivalent circuits (MECs), detailed operating principles, and generalized design formulations that account for both electromagnetic and structural considerations. A key contribution is the introduction of the point-of-conversion (PoC) concept, which optimizes PM placement by minimizing magnetic path reluctance. Comparative analysis demonstrates torque density improvements over conventional SRMs and existing PM-assisted designs while maintaining structural robustness. Experimental validation confirms that the proposed 24/22 configuration with inter-phase PMs delivers higher torque per PM volume compared to state-of-the-art designs. The findings provide insights for EV motor designers seeking to balance performance, cost, and reliability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Liang, Frits de Nijs, Buser Say, Hao Wang</p>
            <p>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings, offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic and environmental goals.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Building Thermal Flexibility Into Distribution System: A Privacy-Preserved Dispatch Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Lu, Zeyin Hou, Wei Gu, Yijun Xu</p>
            <p>The inherent thermal storage capacity of buildings brings considerable thermal flexibility to the heating/cooling loads, which are promising demand response resources for power systems. It is widely believed that integrating the thermal flexibility of buildings into the distribution system can improve the operating economy and reliability of the system. However, the private information of the buildings needs to be transferred to the distribution system operator (DSO) to achieve a coordinated optimization, bringing serious privacy concerns to users. Given this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserved optimal dispatch approach for the distribution system incorporating buildings. Using it, the DSO can exploit the thermal flexibility of buildings without accessing their private information, such as model parameters and indoor temperature profiles. Specifically, we first develop an optimal dispatch model for the distribution system integrating buildings, which can be extended to other storage-like flexibility resources. Second, we reveal that the privacy-preserved integration of buildings is a joint privacy preservation problem for both parameters and state variables and then design a privacy-preserved algorithm based on transformation-based encryption, constraint relaxation, and constraint extension techniques. Besides, we implement a detailed privacy analysis for the proposed method, considering both semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Case studies demonstrate the accuracy, privacy-preserved performance, and computational efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Shortlisting Protection Configurations for HVDC Grids and Electrical Energy Hubs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merijn Van Deyck, Geraint Chaffey, Dirk Van Hertem</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a methodology for shortlisting protection system configurations for large HVDC switching stations, which are expected in multiterminal HVDC grids and electrical energy hubs (or energy islands). This novel approach focuses on the configuration of protection equipment and the arrangement of lines and converters in various protection zones, instead of expert decisions on protection strategies based on numerous simulations. A graph-based approach that allows high-level evaluation of possible DC fault impacts is presented. This fault impact evaluation method can evaluate many possible protection configurations allowing the selection of less obvious choices, as experts cannot consider all possible configurations, especially when the switching station size increases. A filtering process is applied to reduce the number of possible configurations based on multiple protection performance metrics which are evaluated for different power flow scenarios. The results for these performance metrics can be compared for configurations with different numbers of HVDC circuit breakers to assess the benefit of increasing the amount of protection equipment in different network topologies. It is also shown that, through continued filtering using additional performance metrics or fault scenarios, the number of possible breaker, cable and converter configurations can be further reduced, leading to a protection design that is well suited for many operational scenarios. The results of the shortlisting process provide insights on the required number of HVDC circuit breakers to limit fault impacts to a given value. Moreover, observed trends in the results could, in future studies, contribute to new design principles and priorities, allowing system developers to more effectively design HVDC protection systems for different operational scenarios and possible investment levels.</p>

            <p>In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios, effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane, often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages. The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.</p>

            <p>Coordinating a high number of flexibility providing units (e.g. to provide ancillary services for the transmission system) across various grid layers requires new control concepts. A flexibility request at a point of common coupling can be met by utilizing a cascaded control structure based on online feedback optimization. In this paper the influence of the parameterization of the individual controllers on the performance of the hierarchical flexibility provision is studied on a three-level test system. The results show a high interdependency between the choice of control parameters of one controller and the behavior of other controllers as well as a significant impact on the accuracy and speed of flexibility provision. With a careful tuning, a cascaded structure based on online feedback optimization can achieve efficient vertical coordination of flexibility providing units.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space.

By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Bruninx, Timothy Verstraeten, Jalal Kazempour, Jan Helsen</p>
            <p>We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</p>

            <p>With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control, while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components.

            <p>The global energy landscape is undergoing a transformative shift towards renewable energy and advanced storage solutions, driven by the urgent need for sustainable and resilient power systems. Isolated offshore communities, such as islands and offshore platforms, which traditionally rely on mainland grids or diesel generators, stand to gain significantly from renewable energy integration. Promising offshore renewable technologies include wind turbines, wave and tidal energy converters, and floating photovoltaic systems, paired with a storage solution like battery energy storage systems. This paper introduces a renewable energy microgrid optimizer (REMO), a tool designed to identify the optimal sizes of renewable generation and storage resources for offshore microgrids. A key challenge in such models is accurately accounting for battery degradation costs. To address this, the REMO model integrates a deep neural network-based battery degradation (DNN-BD) module, which factors in variables like ambient temperature, charge/discharge rates, state of charge, depth of discharge and battery health. Simulations on six test regions demonstrate that the REMO-DNN-BD approach minimizes lifetime energy costs while maintaining high reliability and sustainability, making it a viable design solution for offshore microgrid systems.</p>

            <p>The majority of electric vehicles (EVs) are charged domestically overnight, where the precise timing of power allocation is not important to the user, thus representing a source of flexibility that can be leveraged by charging control algorithms. In this paper, we relax the common assumption, that EVs require full charge every morning, enabling additional flexibility to defer charging of surplus energy to subsequent nights, which can enhance the performance of controlled charging. In particular, we consider a simple domestic smart plug, scheduling power delivery with the objective to minimize CO$_2$ emissions over prediction horizons of multiple sessions -- up to seven days ahead -- utilising model predictive control (MPC). Based on carbon intensity data from the UK National Grid, we demonstrate significant potential for emission reductions with multi-session planning of 40 to 46\% compared to uncontrolled charging and 19 to 26\% compared to single-session planning. Furthermore, we assess, how the driving and charging behaviour of EV users affects the available flexibility and consequentially the potential for emission reductions. Finally, using grid carbon intensity data from 14 different UK regions, we report significant variations in absolute emission reductions based on the local energy mix.</p>

            <p>Integrating VLC with the RIS significantly enhances physical layer security by enabling precise directional signal control and dynamic adaptation to the communication environment. These capabilities strengthen the confidentiality and security of VLC systems. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the joint optimization of VLC AP power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for secure VLC systems, while considering RSMA and power-domain NOMA schemes. Specifically, two frameworks are proposed to maximize both the minimum secrecy rate (SR) and the minimum secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly optimizing power allocation, RIS association, and RIS elements orientation angles for both power-domain NOMA and RSMA-based VLC systems. The proposed frameworks consider random device orientation and guarantee the minimum user-rate requirement. The proposed optimization frameworks belong to the class of mixed integer nonlinear programming, which has no known feasible solution methodology to guarantee the optimal solution. Moreover, the increased degree of freedom and flexibility from the joint consideration of power control, RIS association and element orientation results in a large set of decision variables and constraints, which further complicates the optimization problem. To that end, we utilize a genetic algorithm-based solution method, which through its exploration and exploitation capabilities can obtain a good quality solution. Additionally, comprehensive simulations show that the RSMA scheme outperforms the power-domain NOMA scheme across both the SR and SEE metrics over various network parameters. Furthermore, useful insights on the impact of minimum user rate requirement, number of RIS elements, and maximum VLC AP transmit power on the minimum SR and SEE performances are provided.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel learning economic model predictive control scheme for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to input and state constraints and unknown dynamics. We design a fast and accurate Lipschitz regression method using input and output data that combines clustering and kernel regression to learn the unknown dynamics. In each cluster, the parallel convex optimization problems are solved to estimate the kernel weights and reduce the Lipschitz constant of the predictor, hence limiting the error propagation in the prediction horizon. We derive the two different bounds of learning errors in deterministic and probabilistic forms and customize a new robust constraint-tightening strategy for the discontinuous predictor. Then, the learning economic model predictive control algorithm is formulated by introducing a stabilized optimization problem to construct a Lyapunov function. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the recursive feasibility and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations of a numerical example and a continuously stirred tank reactor.</p>

Starlink dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover. The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud cover of 87.5%</p>

            <h2>Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yushan Li, Jianping He, Dimos V. Dimarogonas</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <h2>Energy Efficient RSMA-Based LEO Satellite Communications Assisted by UAV-Mounted BD-Active RIS: A DRL Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahman Saadat Yeganeh, Hamid Behroozi</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an advanced non-terrestrial communication architecture that integrates Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) with a Beyond-Diagonal Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-ARIS) mounted on a UAV under the coverage of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The BD-ARIS adopts a group-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability, while RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common and private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV positioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and high-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of both the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that TRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate, especially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3 converges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C suffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness of each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is evaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the proposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional RIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G and massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Protective Relays: A Perspective for Current Limiting Control Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Li, Heng Wu, Xiongfei Wang</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters can significantly alter the fault characteristics of power systems, which challenges the proper function of protective relays. This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction between GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in protective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is revealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current reference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising elements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting highly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of such elements. This finding provides insights into the design of CLC for GFM IBRs from a protection perspective. It is further found that even with a highly inductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced by the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based supervising elements. These theoretical findings are corroborated by simulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests.</p>

            <h2>Integrated equilibrium model for electrified logistics and power systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Yao, Xuhang Liu, Anna Scaglione, Shlomo Bekhor, Kenan Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the complex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power delivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified logistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to maximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric delivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the locational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and charging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov decision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to achieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other hand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal e-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the integrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild assumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's fixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this paper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve sustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power systems.</p>

            <h2>Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bodong Shang, Zheng Wang, Xiangyu Li, Chungang Yang, Chao Ren, Haijun Zhang</p>
            <p>To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</p>

            <p>This paper studies cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems that underpin simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for separate information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We propose a joint access point (AP) operation mode selection and power control design, wherein certain APs are designated for energy transmission to EUs, while others are dedicated to information transmission to IUs. The performance of the system, from both a spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) perspective, is comprehensively analyzed. Specifically, we formulate two mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems for maximizing the average sum-SE and EE, under realistic power consumption models and constraints on the minimum individual SE requirements for individual IUs, minimum HE for individual EUs, and maximum transmit power at each AP. The challenging optimization problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The proposed framework design is further applied to the average sum-HE maximization and energy harvesting fairness problems. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed joint AP operation mode selection and power control algorithm can achieve EE performance gains of up to $4$-fold and $5$-fold over random AP operation mode selection, with and without power control respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anushka Sharma, Anamitra Pal, Rajasekhar Anguluri, Tamojit Chakraborty</p>
            <p>Real-time tracking of inertia is important because it reflects the power system's ability to withstand contingencies and maintain frequency security. This paper proposes a practical approach to estimate inertia using ambient phasor measurement unit (PMU) data and a partitioned form of the swing equation. The approach accounts for (bounded) uncertainties in network parameters and PMU measurements, enabling precise estimation of inertia and damping constants, as well as mechanical power inputs. Instead of assuming constant mechanical power input throughout, the approach leverages knowledge of power system operations to determine intervals when it is actually constant to maintain estimation consistency. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 39 bus system integrated with renewable energy sources affirm the method's accuracy and applicability.</p>

            <h2>Power Loss and Temperature Distribution in Coil of PFC Inductor with Air Gap for Multimode Operation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafal Kasikowski</p>
            <p>Power converters inherently display non-linear load characteristics, resulting in a high level of mains harmonics, and hence the necessity of implementing Power Factor Correction (PFC). Active PFC circuitry typically comprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current so that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of the waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC inductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and investigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a combination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC inductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion and, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This paper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct power-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency eddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As demonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level, exhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to the somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing magnetic flux at an air gap. The latter assertion will undergo further, more quantitatively focused research. Finally, the construction of the coil was optimised to reduce power loss by diminishing eddy-current mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Droop Control Strategy for Coordinated Voltage Regulation and Power Sharing in Hybrid AC-MTDC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongjin Du, Tuanku Badzlin Hashfi, Rashmi Prasad, Pedro P. Vergara, Peter Palensky, Aleksandra Lekić</p>
            <p>With the growing integration of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems, there is an increasing need for control strategies that ensure both economic efficiency and robust dynamic performance. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework for hybrid AC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel droop control strategy that coordinates DC voltage and AC frequency regulation. By embedding frequency control loops into the MMCs, the method enables system-wide coordination, enhancing power sharing and improving system resilience under disturbances. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts converter operating points to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations, thus balancing economic objectives with system stability. A modified Nordic test system integrated with a four-terminal MTDC grid is used to validate the approach. Optimization is performed using Julia, while the system's dynamic performance is evaluated through electromagnetic transient simulations with the EMTP software. Case studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower generation costs than active power control and adaptive droop control strategy while maintaining stable control characteristics. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver cost-effective operation without compromising performance, offering a promising solution for the coordinated control of future hybrid AC-DC transmission networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nanda Kishor Panda, Simon H. Tindemans</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV growth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probabilistic ability to offer different flexibility products, namely, redispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed for different categories of charging stations (CS) and dispatch strategies. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. Further, it is shown how machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the day-ahead consumption, followed by operationally predicting redispatch flexibility. The findings demonstrate that the timing of EV arrivals, departures, and connections plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of product offerings, and dependable services can generally be delivered using a sufficiently large number of CSs.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control strategy for achieving precise and robust output voltage regulation in LCC-S resonant converters, specifically designed for wireless power transfer applications. Unlike conventional methods that rely on manually tuned PI controllers or heuristic tuning approaches, our method leverages the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to systematically optimize PI controller parameters. The complex converter dynamics are captured using the Direct Piecewise Affine (DPWA) modeling technique, providing a structured approach to handling its nonlinearities. This integration not only eliminates the need for manual tuning, but also enhances control adaptability under varying operating conditions. The simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed DRL-based tuning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of stability, robustness, and response time. This work demonstrates the potential of DRL in power electronic control, offering a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional controller design approaches.</p>

            <p>Driven by the exponential growth in data traffic and the limitations of Radio Frequency (RF) networks, Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for high data rate communication. However, the inherently dynamic nature of OWC environments resulting from user mobility, and time-varying user demands poses significant challenges for enhanced and sustainable performance. Energy efficiency (EE) is a critical metric for the sustainable operation of next generation wireless networks. Achieving high EE in dynamic OWC environments, especially under time-varying user distributions and heterogeneous service requirements, remains a complex task. In this work, we formulate a discrete-time EE optimisation problem in a dynamic OWC to maximise energy efficiency through determining user connectivity and power allocation. Solving this problem in real time is computationally demanding due to the coupling of user association and power allocation variables over discrete time slots. Therefore, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Prediction and Optimised Power Allocation (PDP-OPA) framework which predicts user arrivals, departures, and traffic demands. Based on these predictions, the framework proactively determines AP-user associations and allocates power dynamically using a Lagrangian-based optimisation strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PDP-OPA significantly enhances system performance, providing solutions close to the optimal ones. The proposed framework improves energy efficiency, sum rate, and bit error rate (BER) compared to distance-based user association and uniform power allocation, validating its effectiveness for real time and adaptive resource management in dynamic OWC systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mubashar Sarfraz, Sheraz Alam, Sajjad A. Ghauri, Asad Mahmood</p>
            <p>Managing massive data flows effectively and resolving spectrum shortages are two challenges that Smart Grid Communication Networks (SGCN) must overcome. To address these problems, we provide a combined optimization approach that makes use of Cognitive Radio (CR) and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technologies. Our work focuses on using user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) techniques to maximize energy efficiency (EE) in SGCN, particularly within Neighbourhood Area Networks (NANs). We develop a joint optimization problem that takes into account the real-world limitations of a CR-NOMA setting. This problem is NP-hard, nonlinear, and nonconvex by nature. To address the computational complexity of the problem, we use the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method, which breaks the problem into UP and PA subproblems. Initially, we proposed the Zebra-Optimization User Pairing (ZOUP) algorithm to tackle the UP problem, which outperforms both Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) and non-optimized NOMA (UPWO) by 78.8\% and 13.6\%, respectively, at a SNR of 15 dB. Based on the ZOUP pairs, we subsequently proposed the PA approach, i.e., ZOUPPA, which significantly outperforms UPWO and ZOUP by 53.2\% and 25.4\%, respectively, at an SNR of 15 dB. A detailed analysis of key parameters, including varying SNRs, power allocation constants, path loss exponents, user density, channel availability, and coverage radius, underscores the superiority of our approach. By facilitating the effective use of communication resources in SGCN, our research opens the door to more intelligent and energy-efficient grid systems. Our work tackles important issues in SGCN and lays the groundwork for future developments in smart grid communication technologies by combining modern optimization approaches with CR-NOMA.</p>

            <p>The widespread adoption of IoT has driven the development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in industrial environments, leveraging Industrial IoTs (IIoTs) to automate manufacturing processes and enhance productivity. The transition to autonomous systems introduces significant operational costs, particularly in terms of energy consumption. Accurate modeling and prediction of IIoT energy requirements are critical, but traditional physics- and engineering-based approaches often fall short in addressing these challenges comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for benchmarking and analyzing IIoT devices and applications to uncover insights into their power demands, energy consumption, and performance. To demonstrate this methodology, we develop a comprehensive framework and apply it to study an industrial CPS comprising an educational robotic arm, a conveyor belt, a smart camera, and a compute node. By creating micro-benchmarks and an end-to-end application within this framework, we create an extensive performance and power consumption dataset, which we use to train and analyze ML models for predicting energy usage from features of the application and the CPS system. The proposed methodology and framework provide valuable insights into the energy dynamics of industrial CPS, offering practical implications for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of IIoT-driven automation.</p>

In practical applications, leader agents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide heterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing collision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This letter addresses these gaps by introducing and solving the safety-aware and attack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient observer layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the OL. Then, an attack-resilient compensational signal is designed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL). Finally, a SAAR controller is designed by solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem integrating control barrier function (CBF) certified collision-free safety constraints. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the SAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience. This study also pioneers a three-dimensional (3D) simulation of the SAAR containment control problem for heterogeneous MASs, demonstrating its applicability in realistic multi-agent scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Anomaly Detection in Network Flows with Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions and Deep Unrolling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Schynol, Marius Pesavento</p>
            <p>Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.</p>

            <h2>Towards Probabilistic Dynamic Security Assessment and Enhancement of Large Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Sabot, Pierre-Etienne Labeau, Pierre Henneaux</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel methodology for probabilistic dynamic security assessment and enhancement of power systems that considers load and generation variability, N-2 contingencies, and uncertain cascade propagation caused by uncertain protection system behaviour. In this methodology, a database of likely operating conditions is generated via weather data, a market model and a model of operators' preventive actions. System states are sampled from this database and contingencies are applied to them to perform the security assessment. Rigorous statistical indicators are proposed to decide how many biased and unbiased samples to simulate to reach a target accuracy on the statistical error on the estimated risk from individual contingencies. Optionally, a screening of contingencies can be performed to limit the computational burden of the analysis. Finally, interpretable machine learning techniques are used to identify the root causes of the risk from critical contingencies, to ease the interpretation of the results, and to help with security enhancement. The method is demonstrated on the 73-bus reliability test system, and the scalability to large power systems (with thousands of buses) is also discussed.</p>

            <h2>One Target, Many Views: Multi-User Fusion for Collaborative Uplink ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajad Daei, Gabor Fodor, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>We propose a novel pilot-free multi-user uplink framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mm-wave networks, where single-antenna users transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals without dedicated pilots. The base station exploits the spatial and velocity diversities of users to simultaneously decode messages and detect targets, transforming user transmissions into a powerful sensing tool. Each user's signal, structured by a known codebook, propagates through a sparse multi-path channel with shared moving targets and user-specific scatterers. Notably, common targets induce distinct delay-Doppler-angle signatures, while stationary scatterers cluster in parameter space. We formulate the joint multi-path parameter estimation and data decoding as a 3D super-resolution problem, extracting delays, Doppler shifts, and angles-of-arrival via atomic norm minimization, efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. A core innovation is multiuser fusion, where diverse user observations are collaboratively combined to enhance sensing and decoding. This approach improves robustness and integrates multi-user perspectives into a unified estimation framework, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable communication. Numerical results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances both target estimation and communication performance, highlighting its potential for next-generation ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Power System Transition Planning: An Industry-Aligned Framework for Long-Term Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Al-Shafei, Nima Amjady, Hamidreza Zareipour, Yankai Cao</p>
            <p>This work introduces the category of Power System Transition Planning optimization problem. It aims to shift power systems to emissions-free networks efficiently. Unlike comparable work, the framework presented here broadly applies to the industry's decision-making process. It defines a field-appropriate functional boundary focused on the economic efficiency of power systems. Namely, while imposing a wide range of planning factors in the decision space, the model maintains the structure and depth of conventional power system planning under uncertainty, which leads to a large-scale multistage stochastic programming formulation that encounters intractability in real-life cases. Thus, the framework simultaneously invokes high-performance computing defaultism. In this comprehensive exposition, we present a guideline model, comparing its scope to existing formulations, supported by a fully detailed example problem, showcasing the analytical value of the solution gained in a small test case. Then, the framework's viability for realistic applications is demonstrated by solving an extensive test case based on a realistic planning construct consistent with Alberta's power system practices for long-term planning studies. The framework resorts to Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming as a decomposition method to achieve tractability, leveraging High-Performance Computing and parallel computation.</p>

            <h2>Deep Learning-Enabled System Diagnosis in Microgrids: A Feature-Feedback GAN Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swetha Rani Kasimalla, Kuchan Park, Junho Hong, Young-Jin Kim, HyoJong Lee</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and communication networks has brought both modernization and new vulnerabilities to the power system infrastructure. These vulnerabilities expose the system to internal faults and cyber threats, particularly False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, which can closely mimic real fault scenarios. Hence, this work presents a two-stage fault and cyberattack detection framework tailored for inverter-based microgrids. Stage 1 introduces an unsupervised learning model Feature Feedback Generative Adversarial Network (F2GAN), to distinguish between genuine internal faults and cyber-induced anomalies in microgrids. Compared to conventional GAN architectures, F2GAN demonstrates improved system diagnosis and greater adaptability to zero-day attacks through its feature-feedback mechanism. In Stage 2, supervised machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are applied to localize and classify faults within inverter switches, distinguishing between single-switch and multi-switch faults. The proposed framework is validated on a simulated microgrid environment, illustrating robust performance in detecting and classifying both physical and cyber-related disturbances in power electronic-dominated systems.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jöbke Janssen, Alessandro Zocca, Bert Zwart, Jalal Kazempour</p>
            <p>One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Dan, Hongjiang Lei, Ki-Hong Park, Gaofeng Pan, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
            <p>This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{é}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p>To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</p>

            <p>Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Power Radiation Model and Optimal Beamforming Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxia Xu, Xidong Mu, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Arumugam Nallanathan</p>
            <p>Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

            <h2>Linear Phase Balancing Scheme using Voltage Unbalance Sensitivities in Multi-phase Power Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a computationally efficient method for optimizing multi-zone thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) by leveraging dimensionality reduction through an auto-encoder. We develop a multi-task learning framework to jointly represent latent variables and formulate a state-space model based on observed TCL operation data. This significantly reduces the dimensionality of TCL variables and states while preserving critical nonlinear interdependencies in TCL control. To address various application scenarios, we introduce optimization algorithms based on system identification (OptIden) and system simulation (OptSim) tailored to the latent variable representation. These approaches employ automatic differentiation and zeroth-order techniques, respectively, for efficient implementation. We evaluate the proposed method using a 90-zone apartment prototype, comparing its performance to traditional high-dimensional optimization. Results demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces control costs while achieving significantly higher computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and addressed using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. For performance benchmarking, two time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes are considered: one based on the pinching antenna individually activated for each user, and the other based on the single-pinching-antenna configuration serving all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of the pinching antenna significantly enhances the system sum rate compared to conventional antenna architectures. Moreover, the NOMA-based scheme outperforms the TDMA-based scheme with a single pinching antenna but is outperformed by the TDMA-based approach when the pinching antenna is adaptively configured for each user. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method is shown to achieve near-optimal performance for both NOMA and TDMA with a common pinching-antenna configuration.</p>

            <p>Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.</p>

            <p>Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality.

            <p>Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Limengqian Zheng, Lipeng Zhu, Weijia Wen, Jiayong Li, Cong Zhang</p>
            <p>Existing studies on identifying outliers in wind speed-power datasets are often challenged by the complicated and irregular distributions of outliers, especially those being densely stacked yet staying close to normal data. This could degrade their identification reliability and robustness in practice. To address this defect, this paper develops a three-stage composite outlier identification method by systematically integrating three complementary techniques, i.e., physical rule-based preprocessing, regression learning-enabled detection, and mathematical morphology-based refinement. Firstly, the raw wind speed-power data are preprocessed via a set of simple yet efficient physical rules to filter out some outliers obviously going against the physical operating laws of practical wind turbines. Secondly, a robust wind speed-power regression learning model is built upon the random sample consensus algorithm. This model is able to reliably detect most outliers with the help of an adaptive threshold automatically set by the interquartile range method. Thirdly, by representing the wind speed-power data distribution with a two-dimensional image, mathematical morphology operations are applied to perform refined outlier identification from a data distribution perspective. This technique can identify outliers that are not effectively detected in the first two stages, including those densely stacked ones near normal data points. By integrating the above three techniques, the whole method is capable of identifying various types of outliers in a reliable and adaptive manner. Numerical test results with wind power datasets acquired from distinct wind turbines in practice and from simulation environments extensively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as well as its potential in enhancing wind power prediction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Pierre Pinson, Mads R. Almassalkhi, Yingrui Zhuang, Yifan Su, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed data-driven distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxi Tang, Li Peng</p>
            <p>What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</p>

            <h2>Safe Bottom-Up Flexibility Provision from Distributed Energy Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Costas Mylonas, Emmanouel Varvarigos, Georgios Tsaousoglou</p>
            <p>Modern renewables-based power systems need to tap on the flexibility of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) connected to distribution networks. It is important, however, that DER owners/users remain in control of their assets, decisions, and objectives. At the same time, the dynamic landscape of DER-penetrated distribution networks calls for agile, data-driven flexibility management frameworks. In the face of these developments, the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) paradigm is gaining significant attention, as a distributed and data-driven decision-making policy. This paper addresses the need for bottom-up DER management decisions to account for the distribution network's safety-related constraints. While the related literature on safe MARL typically assumes that network characteristics are available and incorporated into the policy's safety layer, which implies active DSO engagement, this paper ensures that self-organized DER communities are enabled to provide distribution-network-safe flexibility services without relying on the aspirational and problematic requirement of bringing the DSO in the decision-making loop.</p>

            <h2>A Decentralized Local Flexibility Market for Local Energy Communities to Mitigate Grid Congestion: A Case Study in Sweden</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Mohiti, Mohammadreza Mazidi, David Steen, Le Anh Tuan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a preventive congestion management framework with joint Local Flexibility Capacity Market (LFCM) and Local Energy Markets (LEMs). The framework enables Local Energy Communities (LECs) to optimize their flexibility potential across the LEM, LFCM, and heat markets. The LECs utilize their heat and electricity resources to offer flexibility services to Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for congestion relief. In this framework, energy and flexibility are treated as separate variables, each subject to different pricing scheme. Flexibility prices are market-driven, dynamically reflecting the location and severity of congestion. A case study conducted at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion by trading the LECs flexibility in the LFCM. The study also highlights up to 40% financial benefits for LECs, promoting the LFCM as a viable solution for congestion management in future decentralized energy systems.</p>

            <h2>Trading off regional and overall energy system design flexibility in the net-zero transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koen van Greevenbroek, Aleksander Grochowicz, Marianne Zeyringer, Fred Espen Benth</p>
            <p>The transition to net-zero emissions in Europe is determined by a patchwork of country-level and EU-wide policy, creating coordination challenges in an interconnected system. We use an optimisation model to map out near-optimal energy system designs for 2050, focussing on the planning flexibility of individual regions while maintaining overall system robustness against different weather years, cost assumptions, and land use limitations. Our results reveal extensive flexibility at a regional level, where only few technologies (solar around the Adriatic and wind on the British Isles and in Germany) cannot be substituted. National policymakers can influence renewable energy export and hydrogen strategies significantly, provided they coordinate this with the remaining European system. However, stronger commitment to solar in Southern Europe and Germany unlocks more design options for Europe overall. These results on regional trade-offs facilitate more meaningful policy discussions which are crucial in the transition to a sustainable energy system.</p>

By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Fairness-aware Dynamic Hosting Capacity and the Impacts of Strategic Solar PV Curtailment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beyzanur Aydin, Rebecca Holt, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar photovoltaics (PV), poses a risk to the distribution grid under high penetration. Therefore, studying hosting capacity (HC) limits considering grid physics and demand variability is crucial. This paper introduces an improved framework for determining the HC of radial distribution networks by enhancing an existing convex inner approximation (CIA) approach. The proposed method achieves a more accurate and larger inner approximation, resulting in better HC limits. We also consider time-varying demand and the design of objective functions to ensure equitable access to grid resources. A case study with solar PV integration is conducted using a modified IEEE-37 radial network to examine the impact of increased PV capacity, demonstrating that with no more than 5% annual solar PV energy curtailed, it is possible to increase solar PV hosting capacity by at least 50% with no negative grid impacts and a net positive economic impact when accounted for the cost of carbon. Results show that fair allocation methods can lead to higher net profits and reduced PV curtailment and CO2.</p>

            <h2>Two-Agent DRL for Power Allocation and IRS Orientation in Dynamic NOMA-based OWC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahrar N. Hamad, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir E.H. El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani</p>
            <p>Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) technology has been considered a promising solution in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to its potential to overcome the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage issue and enhance coverage. Moreover, integrating IRS with a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission technique for multi-users is a smart solution to achieve a high sum rate and improve system performance. In this paper, a dynamic IRS-assisted NOMA-VLC system is modeled, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize sum energy efficiency (SEE) and fairness among multiple mobile users under power allocation and IRS mirror orientation constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the non-linearity of the constraints, conventional optimization methods are impractical for real-time solutions. Therefore, a two-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for optimizing power allocation and IRS orientation based on centralized training with decentralized execution to obtain fast and real-time solutions in dynamic environments. The results show the superior performance of the proposed DRL algorithm compared to standard DRL algorithms typically used for resource allocation in wireless communication. The results also show that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves higher performance compared to deployments without IRS and with randomly oriented IRS elements.</p>

            <h2>Logic-based Resilience Computation of Power Systems Against Frequency Requirements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Negar Monir, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Sadegh Soudjani</p>
            <p>Incorporating renewable energy sources into modern power grids has significantly decreased system inertia, which has raised concerns about power system vulnerability to disturbances and frequency instability. The conventional methods for evaluating transient stability by bounding frequency deviations are often conservative and may not accurately reflect real-world conditions and operational constraints. To address this, we propose a framework for assessing the resilience of power systems against disturbances while adhering to realistic operational frequency constraints. Our approach leverages the Lure system representation of power system dynamics and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to capture the essential frequency response requirements set by grid operators. This enables us to translate frequency constraints into formal robustness semantics. We then formulate an optimization problem to identify the maximum disturbance that the system can withstand without violating these constraints. The resulting optimization is translated into a scenario optimization while addressing the uncertainty in the obtained solution. The proposed methodology has been simulated on the Single Machine Infinite Bus case study and 9-Bus IEEE benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing resilience across various operating conditions and delivering promising results.</p>

            <h2>Learning-Based Modeling of Soft Actuators Using Euler Spiral-Inspired Curvature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Mei, Shangyuan Yuan, Xinda Qi, Preston Fairchild, Xiaobo Tan</p>
            <p>Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum structures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to significant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we introduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler spiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes of soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural network-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model accurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and payload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed actuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low average positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator length at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively. Furthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads with an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results underscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Allocation for OFDM-based Ranging Using Random Communication Signals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying Zhang, Fan Liu, Tao Liu, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>High-precision ranging plays a crucial role in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. To improve the ranging performance while maximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to reuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent randomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC system under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of both periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the ISAC signal. Towards that end, we first derive the closed-form expressions of the average squared P-ACF and A-ACF, and then propose to minimize the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under arbitrary constellation mapping. We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme achieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step further, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at every lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with frequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the ranging resolution. We reveal that there exists a tradeoff between sidelobe level and mainlobe width, and propose a project gradient descent algorithm to seek a locally optimal PA scheme that reduces the EISL. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed PA methods in reducing the ranging sidelobe level for random OFDM signals.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Driven Neural Compensation For Electrical Impedance Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuyu Wang, Huiting Deng, Dong Liu</p>
            <p>Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction, but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT, thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The integration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum and infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The introduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities related to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant research focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security (PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages embedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious sensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance and security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique opportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential eavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS methodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC. The study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS and sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the existing literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for ISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current state of research. The study concludes by outlining potential avenues for future research pertaining to secure ISAC systems.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates an integrated sensing, communication, and computing system deployed over low-altitude networks for enabling applications within the low-altitude economy. In the considered system, a full-duplex enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched in the airspace, functioning as a UAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ULAP). The ULAP is capable of achieving simultaneous information transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge computing services. To reduce the overall energy consumption of the system while meeting the sensing beampattern threshold and user computation requirements, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing the task allocation, computation resource allocation, transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. Since the problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternation optimization, which decomposes the original problem into tractable convex subproblems. Moreover, we analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme saves up to 54.12\% energy consumption performance compared to the benchmark schemes.</p>

            <h2>Voltage Stability and Control of Electrical Distribution Systems with High Penetration of Power Electronic Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dionysios Moutevelis</p>
            <p>Power systems are currently undergoing a rapid paradigm change in their operation. Centralised energy production is being replaced by a number of Distributed Generation (DG) units that are placed at different locations and voltage levels in power networks. These distributed units are mostly based on renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines and photovoltaic cells and are commonly interfaced to the grid via power electronic converters. These sources reduce energy system dependency on conventional generation units based on fossil fuels. At the same time, this shift introduces technical challenges for the safe and reliable operation of electricity network since DG sources do not inherently provide the grid regulation services of conventional, centralised generation units. Moreover, the increased penetration of renewable energy sources and their converter-based interfaces is creating voltage deviation and voltage stability issues in distribution networks. These issues range from overvoltages during hours of peak renewable generation, reverse power flows and sudden voltage drops due to the variable nature of renewable energy production. All of the above jeopardise the reliable operation of the distribution networks that were not originally designed to accommodate for these effects. The objective of this thesis is to propose novel techniques for the accurate assessment of the DG impact on voltage stability in distribution net works and investigate how the control capabilities of converter-based interfaces of DG units can be harnessed to improve stability margins and overall system robustness and performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 24.14\%. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and rate of change of voltage (ROCOV), keeping both within acceptable limits. This significantly strengthens system resilience, particularly in inertia-less power networks.</p>

We propose a two-stage training process with a UNet-based architecture, incorporating an auxiliary regression head to predict the quality of the experimental pattern and assess the progress of the denoising process. The model uses an adaptive denoising strategy, which integrates quality prediction and feedback-driven iterative denoising process control. This adaptive feedback loop allows the model to adjust its schedule, providing fine control over the denoising process. Furthermore, our model can identify samples where no meaningful signal is present, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations. We demonstrate the successful application of diffusion models to EBSD pattern denoising using a custom-collected dataset of EBSD patterns, their corresponding master patterns, and quality values.</p>

            <p>While electrifying transportation eliminates tailpipe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electric vehicle (EV) adoption can create additional electricity sector emissions. To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andres Intriago, Alexandros Paspatis, Francesco Liberati, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the power grid introduces new challenges, requiring detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) studies to analyze system interactions. Despite these needs, access to the internal firmware of power electronic devices remains restricted due to stringent nondisclosure agreements enforced by manufacturers. To address this, we explore three system identification techniques: sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA), step excitation method (SEM), and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA). SFRA employs sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies to measure the system's frequency response, while SEM and ERA utilize step functions to derive time-domain responses and transform them into Laplace-domain transfer functions. All three approaches are shown to provide consistent results in identifying the dq admittance of grid-forming inverters (GFM) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 Hz.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Bouterakos, Joseph McKeon, Georgios Tzounas</p>
            <p>The paper focuses on the problem of tracking eigenvalue trajectories in large-scale power system models as system parameters vary. A continuation-based formulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which supports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and semi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such as numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and handling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical recommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.</p>

            <h2>Towards Accurate Forecasting of Renewable Energy : Building Datasets and Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Solar and Wind Power in France</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eloi Lindas, Yannig Goude, Philippe Ciais</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiaki Kojima, Yuya Muto, Hikaru Akutsu, Rinnosuke Shima, Yoshihiko Susuki</p>
            <p>In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p>

            <h2>Neural Risk Limiting Dispatch in Power Networks: Formulation and Generalization Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ge Chen, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Risk limiting dispatch (RLD) has been proposed as an approach that effectively trades off economic costs with operational risks for power dispatch under uncertainty. However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches zero with high probability as more samples are utilized. Simulation tests across various systems demonstrate our method's superior performance in convergence, suboptimality, and computational efficiency compared with benchmarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Miretti, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Sławomir Stańczak</p>
            <p>In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and we jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.</p>

            <h2>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur</p>
            <p>The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fei Shang, Haohua Du, Dawei Yan, Panlong Yang, Xiang-Yang Li</p>
            <p>Due to its ability to work in non-line-of-sight and low-light environments, radio frequency (RF) imaging technology is expected to bring new possibilities for embodied intelligence and multimodal sensing. However, widely used RF devices (such as Wi-Fi) often struggle to provide high-precision electromagnetic measurements and large-scale datasets, hindering the application of RF imaging technology. In this paper, we combine the ideas of PINN to design the RINN network, using physical constraints instead of true value comparison constraints and adapting it with the characteristics of ubiquitous RF signals, allowing the RINN network to achieve RF imaging using only one sample without phase and with amplitude noise. Our numerical evaluation results show that compared with 5 classic algorithms based on phase data for imaging results, RINN's imaging results based on phaseless data are good, with indicators such as RRMSE (0.11) performing similarly well. RINN provides new possibilities for the universal development of radio frequency imaging technology.</p>

            <h2>A Quadratic Control Framework for Dynamic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor Ladnik</p>
            <p>This article presents a unified approach to quadratic optimal control for both linear and nonlinear discrete-time systems, with a focus on trajectory tracking. The control strategy is based on minimizing a quadratic cost function that penalizes deviations of system states and control inputs from their desired trajectories. For linear systems, the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) solution is derived using dynamic programming, resulting in recursive equations for feedback and feedforward terms. For nonlinear dynamics, the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) method is employed, which iteratively linearizes the system and solves a sequence of LQR problems to converge to an optimal policy. To implement this approach, a software service was developed and tested on several canonical models, including: Rayleigh oscillator, inverted pendulum on a moving cart, two-link manipulator, and quadcopter. The results confirm that iLQR enables efficient and accurate trajectory tracking in the presence of nonlinearities. To further enhance performance, it can be seamlessly integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC), enabling online adaptation and improved robustness to constraints and system uncertainties.</p>

            <h2>A Point-Hyperplane Geometry Method for Operational Security Region of Renewable Energy Generation in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Can Wan, Biao Li, Xuejun Hu, Yunyi Li, Ping Ju</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of renewable energy generation challenges the secure operation of power systems. It becomes crucial to quantify the critical security boundaries and hosting capability of renewable generation at the system operation level. This paper proposes a novel point-hyperplane geometry (PHG) method to accurately obtain the geometric expression of the operational security region of renewable energy generation for power systems. Firstly, the geometric expression of the operational security region is defined as a polytope of boundary hyperplanes in the form of inequalities satisfying the system operation constraints. Then, an orthogonal basis generation method is proposed to solve a single boundary hyperplane of the polytope based on intersecting and orthogonal geometric principles. Next, a point-hyperplane iteration algorithm is developed to progressively obtain the overall geometric polytope of the operational security region of renewable energy generation in power systems. Besides, the flexible performance trade-off can be achieved by modifying the proposed maximum tolerated angle between adjacent hyperplanes. Finally, comprehensive case studies verify the effectiveness and superiority of the PHG method.</p>

            <p>Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers iteratively drive a plant to an optimal operating point that satisfies input and output constraints, relying solely on the input-output sensitivity as model information.

Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in a safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can cope with non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel prognostics-driven approach to optimize operations and maintenance (O&M) decisions in hydropower systems. Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.</p>

            <p>Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.</p>

            <p>The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19-36% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples.

Results show that the framework approximates the value function with over 98% accuracy and provides high-quality solutions with an optimality gap of less than 1%.

We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output.

            <p>Modern power systems face growing risks from cyber-physical attacks, necessitating enhanced resilience due to their societal function as critical infrastructures. The challenge is that defense of large-scale systems-of-systems requires scalability in their threat and risk assessment environment for cyber physical analysis including cyber-informed transmission planning, decision-making, and intrusion response. Hence, we present a scalable discrete event simulation tool for analysis of energy systems, called DESTinE. The tool is tailored for largescale cyber-physical systems, with a focus on power systems. It supports faster-than-real-time traffic generation and models packet flow and congestion under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using three well-established power system synthetic cases with 500, 2000, and 10,000 buses, we overlay a constructed cyber network employing star and radial topologies. Experiments are conducted to identify critical nodes within a communication network in response to a disturbance. The findings are incorporated into a constrained optimization problem to assess the impact of the disturbance on a specific node and its cascading effects on the overall network. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, a new hybrid network topology is also derived, combining the strengths of star and radial structures to improve network resilience. Furthermore, DESTinE is integrated with a virtual server and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system using Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shayan Bafandkar, Alireza Talebpour</p>
            <p>Large-scale adoption of commercial and personal Electric Vehicles (EVs) is expected to significantly affect traffic flow dynamics, emissions, and energy consumption in the transportation sector. Range anxiety and challenges associated with charging EVs are among the key issues that reduce the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, limit their system-level impacts. A promising solution to address these challenges is the introduction of charging while driving (CWD) lanes. Although technological advancements have made it possible to charge vehicles wirelessly while driving, introducing such lanes to the traffic stream can potentially disturb traffic flow and result in new congestion patterns. This study puts forward a framework to investigate the effects of CWD lanes on traffic flow, considering %autonomy, speed harmonization, and environmental factors for different market penetration rates (MPRs) of personal and commercial EVs. Different policies have been investigated to suggest the best design for CWD lanes. Results indicate that introducing CWD lanes can decrease overall traffic throughput and increase congestion due to additional lane-changing maneuvers by electric vehicles aiming to utilize the CWD lane. Although higher MPRs of EVs help stabilize traffic flow and reduce the number of shockwaves, speed disruption tends to increase in the CWD lane and propagate to adjacent lanes. Emission analyses show significant reductions (up to 63\%) in pollution levels with increasing MPRs of personal and commercial EVs. Our analysis shows that while CWD lanes can facilitate the adoption of EVs, they can deteriorate traffic efficiency, emphasizing the importance of careful design and policy considerations.</p>

            <p>Satellite networks are emerging as vital solutions for global connectivity beyond 5G. As companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb, and Amazon are poised to launch a large number of satellites in low Earth orbit, the heightened inter-satellite interference caused by mega-constellations has become a significant concern. To address this challenge, recent works have introduced the concept of satellite cluster networks where multiple satellites in a cluster collaborate to enhance the network performance. In order to investigate the performance of these networks, we propose mathematical analyses by modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point processes, building on the success of stochastic geometry-based analyses for satellite networks. In particular, we suggest the lower and upper bounds of the coverage probability as functions of the system parameters, including satellite density, satellite altitude, satellite cluster area, path loss exponent, and Nakagami parameter $m$. We validate the analytical expressions by comparing them with simulation results. Our analyses can be used to design reliable satellite cluster networks by effectively estimating the impact of system parameters on the coverage performance.</p>

The Time-Aware Module employed a PatchTST-inspired Transformer to capture both local and global dependencies in PV power time series. Meanwhile, the Prompt-Aware Module encodes textual prompts from historical statistics and dataset descriptors via a large language model. Additionally, the Vision-Aware Module utilizes a pretrained vision-language model to extract high-level semantic features from sky images, emphasizing cloud motion and irradiance fluctuations. The proposed PV-VLM is evaluated using data from a 30-kW rooftop array at Stanford University and through a transfer study on PV systems at the University of Wollongong in Australia. Comparative experiments reveal an average RMSE reduction of approximately 5% and a MAE improvement of nearly 6%, while the transfer study shows average RMSE and MAE reductions of about 7% and 9.5%, respectively. Overall, PV-VLM leverages complementary modalities to provide a robust solution for grid scheduling and energy market participation, enhancing the stability and reliability of PV integration.</p>

            <h2>Joint Oscillation Damping and Inertia Provision Service for Converter-Interfaced Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Feng, Linbin Huang, Xiuqiang He, Yi Wang, Florian Dörfler, Chongqing Kang</p>
            <p>Power systems dominated by converter-interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) typically exhibit weaker damping capabilities and lower inertia, compromising system stability. Although individual DER controllers are evolving to provide superior oscillation damping capabilities and inertia supports, there is a lack of network-wide coordinated management measures for multiple DERs, potentially leading to unexpected instability and cost-effectiveness problems. To address this gap, this paper introduces a hybrid oscillation damping and inertia management strategy for multiple DERs, considering network coupling effects, and seeks to encourage DERs to provide enhanced damping and inertia with appropriate economic incentives. We first formulate an optimization problem to tune and allocate damping and inertia coefficients for DERs, minimizing associated power and energy costs while ensuring hard constraints for system frequency stability and small-signal stability. The problem is built upon a novel convex parametric formulation that integrates oscillation mode location and frequency trajectory requirements, equipped with a theoretical guarantee, and eliminating the need for iterative tuning and computation burdens. Furthermore, to increase the willingness of DERs to cooperate, we further design appropriate economic incentives to compensate for DERs' costs based on the proposed cost minimization problem, and assess its impact on system cost-efficiency. Numerical tests highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting system stability and offer insights into potential economic benefits.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Utility-Scale Solar Siting for Local Economic Benefits and Regional Decarbonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Papa Yaw Owusu-Obeng, Steven R. Miller, Sarah Banas Mills, Michael T. Craig</p>
            <p>The Midwest, with its vast agricultural lands, is rapidly emerging as a key region for utility-scale solar expansion. However, traditional power planning has yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to guide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to emphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting productive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by endogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning model to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for the cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great Lakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that are embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at minimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our findings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland productivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of installed solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to $34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller counties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced agricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland quality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher economic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by 2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by 39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5% in system-wide costs. These findings underscore the importance of integrating economic considerations into utility-scale solar planning to better align decarbonization goals with regional and local economic development.</p>

            <h2>Effect of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels on low-voltage feeders: Evidence from smart meter profiles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Becker, R. Smet, B. Macharis, K. Vanthournout</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and solar panels are low-carbon technologies (LCTs) that are being connected to the low-voltage grid (LVG) at a rapid pace. One of the main hurdles to understand their impact on the LVG is the lack of recent, large electricity consumption datasets, measured in real-world conditions. We investigated the contribution of LCTs to the size and timing of peaks on LV feeders by using a large dataset of 42,089 smart meter profiles of residential LVG customers. These profiles were measured in 2022 by Fluvius, the distribution system operator (DSO) of Flanders, Belgium. The dataset contains customers that proactively requested higher-resolution smart metering data, and hence is biased towards energy-interested people. LV feeders of different sizes were statistically modelled with a profile sampling approach. For feeders with 40 connections, we found a contribution to the feeder peak of 1.2 kW for a HP, 1.4 kW for an EV and 2.0 kW for an EV charging faster than 6.5 kW. A visual analysis of the feeder-level loads shows that the classical duck curve is replaced by a night-camel curve for feeders with only HPs and a night-dromedary curve for feeders with only EVs charging faster than 6.5 kW. Consumption patterns will continue to change as the energy transition is carried out, because of e.g. dynamic electricity tariffs or increased battery capacities. Our introduced methods are simple to implement, making it a useful tool for DSOs that have access to smart meter data to monitor changing consumption patterns.</p>

            <h2>Market-Driven Flexibility Provision: A Tri-Level Optimization Approach for Carbon Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijie Pan, Gerrit Rolofs, Luca Pontecorvi, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The integration of renewable energy resources (RES) in the power grid can reduce carbon intensity, but also presents certain challenges. The uncertainty and intermittent nature of RES emphasize the need for flexibility in power systems. Moreover, there are noticeable mismatches between real-time electricity prices and carbon intensity patterns throughout the day. These discrepancies may lead customers to schedule energy-intensive tasks during the early hours of the day, a period characterized by lower electricity prices but higher carbon intensity. This paper introduces a novel and comprehensive framework aimed at encouraging customer participation in electricity markets and aligning their flexibility with carbon intensity trends. The proposed approach integrates an incentive-based tariff with a tri-level optimization model, where customers are motivated to submit flexibility bids and, in return, receive financial rewards based on their contributions. The tri-level model ensures a dynamic interaction between the market operation platform (MOP) and end-users. Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE-33 bus system, supported by two scenarios with different RES generations and customer behaviors. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in guiding the customers' consumption behaviors towards low carbon intensity.</p>

            <h2>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Schaurecker, David Wozabal, Nils Löhndorf, Thorsten Staake</p>
            <p>Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</p>

            <h2>Balancing Passenger Transport and Power Distribution: A Distributed Dispatch Policy for Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jake Robbennolt, Meiyi Li, Javad Mohammadi, Stephen D. Boyles</p>
            <p>Shared autonomous electric vehicles can provide on-demand transportation for passengers while also interacting extensively with the electric distribution system. This interaction is especially beneficial after a disaster when the large battery capacity of the fleet can be used to restore critical electric loads. We develop a dispatch policy that balances the need to continue serving passengers (especially critical workers) and the ability to transfer energy across the network. The model predictive control policy tracks both passenger and energy flows and provides maximum passenger throughput if any policy can. The resulting mixed integer linear programming problem is difficult to solve for large-scale problems, so a distributed solution approach is developed to improve scalability, privacy, and resilience. We demonstrate that the proposed heuristic, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, is effective in achieving near-optimal solutions quickly. The dispatch policy is examined in simulation to demonstrate the ability of vehicles to balance these competing objectives with benefits to both systems. Finally, we compare several dispatch behaviors, demonstrating the importance of including operational constraints and objectives from both the transportation and electric systems in the model.</p>

            <h2>Do Segmentation Models Understand Vascular Structure? A Blob-Based XAI Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Garret, Antoine Vacavant, Carole Frindel</p>
            <p>Deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in medical image segmentation, yet their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. In vascular applications, trustworthy segmentation should rely on both local image cues and global anatomical structures, such as vessel connectivity or branching. However, the extent to which models leverage such global context remains unclear. We present a novel explainability pipeline for 3D vessel segmentation, combining gradient-based attribution with graph-guided point selection and a blob-based analysis of Saliency maps. Using vascular graphs extracted from ground truth, we define anatomically meaningful points of interest (POIs) and assess the contribution of input voxels via Saliency maps. These are analyzed at both global and local scales using a custom blob detector. Applied to IRCAD and Bullitt datasets, our analysis shows that model decisions are dominated by highly localized attribution blobs centered near POIs. Attribution features show little correlation with vessel-level properties such as thickness, tubularity, or connectivity -- suggesting limited use of global anatomical reasoning. Our results underline the importance of structured explainability tools and highlight the current limitations of segmentation models in capturing global vascular context.</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive Signal Modeling for Talkative Power Conversion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Mietzner, Cerikh Chakraborty, Peter A. Hoeher, Lutz Lampe</p>
            <p>Talkative power conversion is a switching ripple communication technique that integrates data modulation into a switched-mode power electronics converter, enabling simultaneous information transmission and power conversion. Despite numerous research papers published over the last decade on various theoretical and practical aspects of this emerging topic, thorough signal modeling suitable for analysis and computer simulations is still lacking. In this article, we derive the continuous-time output voltage of a DC/DC switched-mode power electronics converter for a broad range of pulsed-based modulation schemes. We also develop corresponding discrete-time signal models and assess their accuracies. Finally, we devise a generic end-to-end signal model for arbitrary modulation signals, discuss implications of continuous-time and discrete-time signal modeling on equalization, and consider generalizations to include parasitic effects as well as the influence of general impedance loads.</p>

            <h2>Data driven approach towards more efficient Newton-Raphson power flow calculation for distribution grids</h2>

            <p>Power flow (PF) calculations are fundamental to power system analysis to ensure stable and reliable grid operation. The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is commonly used for PF analysis due to its rapid convergence when initialized properly. However, as power grids operate closer to their capacity limits, ill-conditioned cases and convergence issues pose significant challenges. This work, therefore, addresses these challenges by proposing strategies to improve NR initialization, hence minimizing iterations and avoiding divergence. We explore three approaches: (i) an analytical method that estimates the basin of attraction using mathematical bounds on voltages, (ii) Two data-driven models leveraging supervised learning or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to predict optimal initial guesses, and (iii) a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that incrementally adjusts voltages to accelerate convergence. These methods are tested on benchmark systems. This research is particularly relevant for modern power systems, where high penetration of renewables and decentralized generation require robust and scalable PF solutions. In experiments, all three proposed methods demonstrate a strong ability to provide an initial guess for Newton-Raphson method to converge with fewer steps. The findings provide a pathway for more efficient real-time grid operations, which, in turn, support the transition toward smarter and more resilient electricity networks.</p>

            <h2>Optimal SVI-Weighted PSPS Decisions with Decision-Dependent Outage Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Greenough, Kohei Murakami, Jan Kleissl, Adil Khurram</p>
            <p>Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) are a pre-emptive strategy to mitigate the wildfires caused by power system malfunction. System operators implement PSPS to balance wildfire mitigation efforts through de-energization of transmission lines against the risk of widespread blackouts modeled with load shedding. Existing approaches do not incorporate decision-dependent wildfire-driven failure probabilities, as modeling outage scenario probabilities requires incorporating high-order polynomial terms in the objective. This paper uses distribution shaping to develop an efficient MILP problem representation of the distributionally robust PSPS problem. Building upon the author's prior work, the wildfire risk of operating a transmission line is a function of the probability of a wildfire-driven outage and its subsequent expected impact in acres burned. A day-ahead unit commitment and line de-energization PSPS framework is used to assess the trade-off between total cost and wildfire risk at different levels of distributional robustness, parameterized by a level of distributional dissimilarity $\kappa$. We perform simulations on the IEEE RTS 24-bus test system.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Power Swing Characteristics of Grid-Forming VSC System Considering the Current Limitation Mode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Xiong, Heng Wu, Yifei Li, Xiongfei Wang</p>
            <p>This paper investigates power swing characteristics of grid-forming voltage source converter (GFM-VSC) systems considering the current limitation mode in both non-inertial and inertial GFM-VSC systems. Following grid faults, non-inertial GFM-VSC systems can re-synchronize with the grid but may experience significant power swings driven by its control dynamics, while inertial GFM-VSC systems may exhibit loss of synchronization (LOS), characterized by the divergence of the output angle in the active power control loop. These behaviours are different from conventional synchronous generator (SG)-based systems, where power swings are typically characterized by physical angle deviations among power sources. Based on these findings, this paper explores the performance of traditional impedance-based swing detection schemes in GFM-VSC systems. The theoretical analysis is validated through various simulations using the PSCAD/EMTDC platform, covering both single and multi-machine system scenarios.</p>

We also review the detection and localization schemes for LAAs that employ either model-based or data-driven approaches, with some hybrid methods combining the strengths of both. Additionally, mitigation techniques are examined, focusing on both preventive measures, designed to thwart attack execution, and reactive methods, which aim to optimize responses to ongoing attacks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengshuo Jia, Zeyu Cui, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Secure Estimation of Battery Voltage Under Sensor Attacks: A Self-Learning Koopman Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy</p>
            <p>Cloud-based battery management system (BMS) requires accurate terminal voltage measurement data to ensure optimal and safe charging of Lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the battery terminal voltage data as it passes from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS through the communication network, with the objective of under- or over-charging the battery. To ensure accurate terminal voltage data under such malicious sensor attacks, this paper investigates a Koopman-based secure terminal voltage estimation scheme using a two-stage error-compensated self-learning feedback. During the first stage of error correction, the potential Koopman prediction error is estimated to compensate for the error accumulation due to the linear approximation of Koopman operator. The second stage of error compensation aims to recover the error amassing from the higher-order dynamics of the Lithium-ion batteries missed by the self-learning strategy. Specifically, we have proposed two different methods for this second stage error compensation. First, an interpretable empirical correction strategy has been obtained using the open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for the battery. Second, a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method has been explored. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed secure estimator using both empirical and data-driven corrections.</p>

            <p>Optimal charging of electric vehicle (EVs) depends heavily on reliable sensor measurements from the battery pack to the cloud-controller of the smart charging station. However, an adversary could corrupt the voltage sensor data during transmission, potentially causing local to wide-scale disruptions. Therefore, it is essential to detect sensor cyberattacks in real-time to ensure secure EV charging, and the developed algorithms must be readily adaptable to variations, including pack configurations. To tackle these challenges, we propose adaptable fine-tuning of an XgBoost-based cell-level model using limited pack-level data to use for voltage prediction and residual generation. We used battery cell and pack data from high-fidelity charging experiments in PyBaMM and `liionpack' package to train and test the detection algorithm. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated for two large-format battery packs under sensor swapping and replay attacks. The simulation results also highlight the adaptability and efficacy of our proposed detection algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lesley Wheat, Martin v. Mohrenschildt, Saeid Habibi, Dhafar Al-Ani</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the problem of domain shifts in electric motor vibration data created by new operating conditions in testing scenarios, focusing on bearing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The proposed method combines the Harmonic Feature Space (HFS) with regression to correct for frequency and energy differentials in steady-state data, enabling accurate FDD on unseen operating conditions within the range of the training conditions. The HFS aligns harmonics across different operating frequencies, while regression compensates for energy variations, preserving the relative magnitude of vibrations critical for fault detection. The proposed approach is evaluated on a detection problem using experimental data from a Belt-Starter Generator (BSG) electric motor, with test conditions having a minimum 1000 RPM and 5 Nm difference from training conditions. Results demonstrate that the method outperforms traditional analysis techniques, achieving high classification accuracy at a 94% detection rate and effectively reducing domain shifts. The approach is computationally efficient, requires only healthy data for training, and is well-suited for real-world applications where the exact application operating conditions cannot be predetermined.</p>

            <p>As an emerging technology, the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks by mitigating the interference of the incident signals. The STAR-RIS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fully cover the dynamic environment through high mobility and fast deployment. According to the dynamic air-to-ground channels, the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV may face a challenge configuring their elements' coefficients (i.e., reflecting and transmitting the amplitude and phases). Hence, to meet the requirements of dynamic channel determination with the SE approach, this paper proposes the sum rate maximization of both PUs and SUs through non-orthogonal multiple access in CR network to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission-reflection beamforming design of the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV, and power allocation. Since the non-convex joint optimization problem includes coupled optimization variables, we develop an alternative optimization algorithm. Simulation results study the impact of: 1) the significant parameters, 2) the performance of different intelligence surface modes and STAR-RIS operating protocols, 3) the joint trajectory and beamforming design with fixed and mobile users, and 4) STAR-RIS capabilities such as mitigating the interference, and how variations in the roles of elements dynamically.</p>

Analyses exploring the price of hydrogen usually calculate average or marginal production costs regardless of the time of delivery. A key factor that affects the price of hydrogen is the balancing costs, which we define as the expense of ensuring a steady schedule of hydrogen delivery. We explore the effect of delivering hydrogen to the export ports at different schedules, ranging from fully flexible to moderately stable with a daily and weekly buffer, to fully stable. We quantify the rise in hydrogen price with strict balancing constraint in three countries: Brazil, Morocco and Turkey, and three export volumes: 10, 50 and 200 TWh. The price difference between the flexible and stable schedules was found to reach a maximum of 36% in Brazil, 47% in Morocco and 18% in Turkey across the different export volumes.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the integration of forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, with a focus on the role of switching costs -- penalties incurred from frequent operational adjustments. We develop a theoretical and empirical framework to examine how forecast accuracy and stability interact with switching costs in online decision-making settings. Our analysis spans both deterministic and stochastic optimization approaches, using point and probabilistic forecasts. A novel metric for measuring temporal consistency in probabilistic forecasts is introduced, and the framework is validated in a real-world battery scheduling case based on the CityLearn 2022 challenge. Results show that switching costs significantly alter the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, and that more stable forecasts can reduce the performance loss due to switching. Contrary to common practice, the findings suggest that, under non-negligible switching costs, longer commitment periods may lead to better overall outcomes. These insights have practical implications for the design of intelligent, forecast-aware energy management systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Bruneel, Mathijs Schuurmans, Panagiotis Patrinos</p>
            <p>Efficient markets are characterised by profit-driven participants continuously refining their positions towards the latest insights. Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Limin Jiang, Yi Shi, Yintao Liu, Qingyu Deng, Siyi Xu, Yihao Shen, Fangfang Ye, Shan Cao, Zhiyuan Jiang</p>
            <p>Wireless baseband processing (WBP) is a key element of wireless communications, with a series of signal processing modules to improve data throughput and counter channel fading. Conventional hardware solutions, such as digital signal processors (DSPs) and more recently, graphic processing units (GPUs), provide various degrees of parallelism, yet they both fail to take into account the cyclical and consecutive character of WBP. Furthermore, the large amount of data in WBPs cannot be processed quickly in symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) due to the unpredictability of memory latency. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical dataflow-driven architecture to accelerate WBP. A pack-and-ship approach is presented under a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture to allow the subordinate tiles to operate in a bundled access and execute manner. We also propose a multi-level dataflow model and the related scheduling scheme to manage and allocate the heterogeneous hardware resources. Experiment results demonstrate that our prototype achieves $2\times$ and $2.3\times$ speedup in terms of normalized throughput and single-tile clock cycles compared with GPU and DSP counterparts in several critical WBP benchmarks. Additionally, a link-level throughput of $288$ Mbps can be achieved with a $45$-core configuration.</p>

            <h2>CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills using Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanghyun Ryu, Qiayuan Liao, Zhongyu Li, Payam Delgosha, Koushil Sreenath, Negar Mehr</p>
            <p>Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world. Project website is this https URL</p>

Occhipinti</p>
            <p>At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse monitoring and assistance needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p<0.01) compared to traditional home environment. Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable framework for patient-centered, long-term care in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</p>

            <h2>Data-Importance-Aware Power Allocation for Adaptive Real-Time Communication in Computer Vision Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunmei Xu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>Life-transformative applications such as immersive extended reality are revolutionizing wireless communications and computer vision (CV). This paper presents a novel framework for importance-aware adaptive data transmissions, designed specifically for real-time CV applications where task-specific fidelity is critical. A novel importance-weighted mean square error (IMSE) metric is introduced as a task-oriented measure of reconstruction quality, considering sub-pixel-level importance (SP-I) and semantic segment-level importance (SS-I) models. To minimize IMSE under total power constraints, data-importance-aware waterfilling approaches are proposed to optimally allocate transmission power according to data importance and channel conditions, prioritizing sub-streams with high importance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform margin-adaptive waterfilling and equal power allocation strategies. The data partitioning that combines both SP-I and SS-I models is shown to achieve the most significant improvements, with normalized IMSE gains exceeding $7\,$dB and $10\,$dB over the baselines at high SNRs ($>10\,$dB). These substantial gains highlight the potential of the proposed framework to enhance data efficiency and robustness in real-time CV applications, especially in bandwidth-limited and resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Effects of Load Altering Attacks on Load Frequency Control through Python and RTDS</h2>

            <p>The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Scrap Composition in Electric Arc and Basic Oxygen Furnaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqing Zhou, Karsten Naert, Dirk Nuyens</p>
            <p>This article aims to determine the composition of scrap (recycled material) used in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) based on the assumption of mass balance. Accurate knowledge of this composition can increase the usage of recycled material to produce steel, reducing the need for raw ore extraction and minimizing environmental impact by conserving natural resources and lowering carbon emissions. The study develops two models to describe the behavior of elements in the EAF or BOF process. A linear state space model is used for elements transferring completely from scrap to steel, while a non-linear state space model is applied to elements moving into both steel and slag. The Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter are employed to approximate these models, respectively. Importantly, the models leverage only data already collected as part of the standard production process, avoiding the need for additional measurements that are often costly. This article outlines the formulation of both models, the algorithms used, and discusses the hyperparameters involved. We provide practical suggestions on how to choose appropriate hyperparameters based on expert knowledge and historical data. The models are applied to real BOF data. Cu and Cr are chosen as examples for linear and non-linear models, respectively. The results show that both models can reconstruct the composition of scrap for these elements. The findings provide valuable insights for improving process control and ensuring product quality in steelmaking.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Popolizio, Torsten Wik, Chih Feng Lee, Changfu Zou</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.</p>

            <h2>A New Paradigm in IBR Modeling for Power Flow and Short Circuit Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahid Javid, Firdous Ul Nazir, Wentao Zhu, Diptargha Chakravorty, Ahmed Aboushady, Mohamed Galeela</p>
            <p>The fault characteristics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) are different from conventional synchronous generators. The fault response of IBRs is non-linear due to saturation states and mainly determined by fault ride through (FRT) strategies of the associated voltage source converter (VSC). This results in prohibitively large solution times for power flows considering these short circuit characteristics, especially when the power system states change fast due to uncertainty in IBR generations. To overcome this, a phasor-domain steady state (SS) short circuit (SC) solver for IBR dominated power systems is proposed in this paper, and subsequently the developed IBR models are incorporated with a novel Jacobian-based Power Flow (PF) solver. In this multiphase PF solver, any power system components can be modeled by considering their original non-linear or linear mathematical representations. Moreover, two novel FRT strategies are proposed to fully utilize the converter capacity and to comply with IEEE-2800 2022 std and German grid code. The results are compared with the Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation on the IEEE 34 test network and the 120 kV EPRI benchmark system. The developed IBR sequence domain PF model demonstrates more accurate behavior compared to the classical IBR generator model. The error in calculating the short circuit current with the proposed SC solver is less than 3%, while achieving significant speed improvements of three order of magnitudes.</p>

            <p>This paper explores a limit avoidance approach in the case of input (modulation) and output (current) constraints with the aim of enhancing system availability of AC drives. Drawing on the observation that, in a certain range of reactive power, there exists a trade-off between current and modulation magnitude, we exploit this freedom and define a constrained optimization problem. We propose two approaches, one in the form of an activation-function which drives the reactive power set-point towards safety, and an approach which uses online feedback optimization to set the reactive power dynamically. Both methods compromise reactive power tracking accuracy for increased system robustness. Through a high fidelity simulation, we compare the benefits of the two methods, highlighting their effectiveness in industrial applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Fan, Shaochuan Wu, Haojie Wang, Mingjun Sun, Jianhe Wang</p>
            <p>This paper investigates multi-target position estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time frequency and space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) signal. Closed-form expressions for the Cramér-Rao lower bound and the positioning error bound (PEB) in multi-target position estimation are derived, providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. To enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, a power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. The results validate the proposed PEB expression and its approximation, clearly illustrating the coordination gain enabled by ISAC. Further, the superiority of using the multi-static CF mMIMO architecture over traditional cellular ISAC is demonstrated, and the advantages of OTFS signals in high-mobility scenarios are highlighted.</p>

            <h2>Cross-Domain Continual Learning for Edge Intelligence in Wireless ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingzhi Hu, Xin Li, Zhou Su, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence (EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices (ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information (CSI). However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability. This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden. In this paper, we propose the EdgeCL framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting. We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples. Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting. Experimental evaluations show that EdgeCL achieves 89% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79%.</p>

            <p>Channel models that represent various operating conditions a communication system might experience are important for design and standardization of any communication system. While statistical channel models have long dominated this space, machine learning (ML) is becoming a popular alternative approach. However, existing approaches have mostly focused on predictive solutions to match instantaneous channel realizations. Other solutions have focused on pathloss modeling, while double-directional (DD) channel representation is needed for a complete description. Motivated by this, we (a) develop a generative solution that uses a hybrid Transformer (hTransformer) model with a low-rank projected attention calculation mechanism and a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layer to generate complete DD channel information and (b) design a domain-knowledge-informed training method to match the generated and true channel realizations' statistics. Our extensive simulation results validate that the generated samples' statistics closely align with the true statistics while mostly outperforming the performance of existing predictive approaches.</p>

            <h2>Techno-economic environmental and social assessment framework for energy transition pathways in integrated energy communities: a case study in Alaska</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayashree Yadav, Ingemar Mathiasson, Bindu Panikkar, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>The transition to low-carbon energy systems demands comprehensive evaluation tools that account for technical, economic, environmental, and social dimensions. While numerous studies address specific aspects of energy transition, few provide an integrated framework that captures the full spectrum of impacts. This study proposes a comprehensive techno-economic, environmental, and social (TEES) assessment framework to evaluate energy transition pathways. The framework provides a structured methodology for assessing infrastructure needs, cost implications, emissions reductions, and social equity impacts, offering a systematic approach for informed decision-making. To illustrate its applicability, a detailed case study of a remote community in Alaska is conducted, evaluating the TEES impacts of three distinct energy transition pathways including heat pumps (HPs) and battery integration, resource coordination and expanded community solar photovoltaic (PV). Findings show that coordination of HPs minimizes peak demand, enhances grid reliability, and reduces energy burdens among low-income households. Extensive simulation-based analysis reveals that strategically staging electric HPs with existing oil heating systems can lower overall energy costs by 19% and reduce emissions by 29% compared to the today's system and outperforms all-heat-pump strategy for economic savings. By combining a generalizable, community-centric assessment framework with data-driven case study insights, this work offers a practical tool for utilities, community stakeholders and policymakers to work toward equitable and sustainable energy transitions.</p>

            <p>Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are set to significantly contribute to global decarbonization efforts. Developers often use a sequential approach to optimize design variables and market participation for grid-integrated offshore wind farms. However, this method can lead to sub-optimal system performance, and uncertainties associated with renewable resources are often overlooked in decision-making. This paper proposes a control co-design approach, optimizing design and control decisions for integrating OWFs into the power grid while considering energy market and primary frequency market participation. Additionally, we introduce optimal sizing solutions for energy storage systems deployed onshore to enhance revenue for OWF developers over time. This framework addresses uncertainties related to wind resources and energy prices. We analyze five U.S. west-coast offshore wind farm locations and potential interconnection points, as identified by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Results show that optimized control co-design solutions can increase market revenue by 3.2\% and provide flexibility in managing wind resource uncertainties.</p>

            <h2>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids with ZIP Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control and communication topology co-design approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (DC MGs) with generic ``ZIP'' loads. While ZIP loads accurately capture the varied nature of the consumer loads, its constant power load (CPL) component is particularly challenging (and destabilizing) due to its non-linear form. Moreover, ensuring simultaneous voltage regulation and current sharing and co-designing controllers and topology are also challenging when designing control solutions for DC MGs. To address these three challenges, we model the DC MG as a networked system comprised of distributed generators (DGs), ZIP loads, and lines interconnected according to a static interconnection matrix. Next, we equip each DG with a local controller and a distributed global controller (over an arbitrary topology) to derive the error dynamic model of the DC MG as a networked ``error'' system, including disturbance inputs and performance outputs. Subsequently, to co-design the controllers and the topology ensuring robust (dissipative) voltage regulation and current sharing performance, we use the dissipativity and sector boundedness properties of the involved subsystems and formulate Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems to be solved locally and globally. To support the feasibility of the global LMI problem, we identify and embed several crucial necessary conditions in the corresponding local LMI problems, thus providing a one-shot approach (as opposed to iterative schemes) to solve the LMI problems. Overall, the proposed approach in this paper provides a unified framework for designing DC MGs. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches.</p>

            <p>The unmanned aerial vehicle assisted multi-access edge computing (UAV-MEC) technology has been widely applied in the sixth-generation era. However, due to the limitations of energy and computing resources in disaster areas, how to efficiently offload the tasks of damaged user equipments (UEs) to UAVs is a key issue. In this work, we consider a multiple UAVMECs assisted task offloading scenario, which is deployed inside the three-dimensional corridors and provide computation services for UEs. In detail, a ground UAV controller acts as the central decision-making unit for deploying the UAV-MECs and allocates the computational resources. Then, we model the relationship between the UAV controller and UEs based on the Stackelberg game. The problem is formulated to maximize the utility of both the UAV controller and UEs. To tackle the problem, we design a K-means based UAV localization and availability response mechanism to pre-deploy the UAV-MECs. Then, a chess-like particle swarm optimization probability based strategy selection learning optimization algorithm is proposed to deal with the resource allocation. Finally, extensive simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the utility of the UAV controller and UEs in various scenarios compared with baseline schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Olivier Huber, Michael C. Ferris, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing number of electric loads, such as hydrogen producers or data centers, can be characterized as carbon-sensitive, meaning that they are willing to adapt the timing and/or location of their electricity usage in order to minimize carbon footprints. However, the emission reduction efforts of these carbon-sensitive loads rely on carbon intensity information such as average carbon emissions, and it is unclear whether load shifting based on these signals effectively reduces carbon emissions. To address this open question, we investigate the impact of carbon-sensitive consumers using equilibrium analysis. Specifically, we expand the commonly used equilibrium model for electricity market clearing to include carbon-sensitive consumers that adapt their consumption based on an average carbon intensity signal. This analysis represents an idealized situation for carbon-sensitive loads, where their carbon preferences are reflected directly in the market clearing, and contrasts with current practice where carbon intensity signals only become known to consumers aposteriori (i.e. after the market has already been cleared). We include both illustrative examples and larger numerical simulations, including benchmarking with other methods, to illuminate the contributions and limitations of carbon-sensitive loads in power system emission reductions.</p>

            <p>Currently, adaptive filtering algorithms have been widely applied in frequency estimation for power systems. However, research on diffusion tasks remains insufficient. Existing diffusion adaptive frequency estimation algorithms exhibit certain limitations in handling input noise and lack robustness against impulsive noise. Moreover, traditional adaptive filtering algorithms designed based on the strictly-linear (SL) model fail to effectively address frequency estimation challenges in unbalanced three-phase power systems. To address these issues, this letter proposes an improved diffusion augmented complex maximum total correntropy (DAMTCC) algorithm based on the widely linear (WL) model. The proposed algorithm not only significantly enhances the capability to handle input noise but also demonstrates superior robustness to impulsive noise. Furthermore, it successfully resolves the critical challenge of frequency estimation in unbalanced three-phase power systems, offering an efficient and reliable solution for diffusion power system frequency estimation. Finally, we analyze the stability of the algorithm and computer simulations verify the excellent performance of the algorithm.</p>

            <p>Cascading failures in power systems caused by sequential tripping of components are a serious concern as they can lead to complete or partial shutdowns, disrupting vital services and causing damage and inconvenience. In prior work, we developed a new approach for identifying and preventing cascading failures in power systems.

In this paper, we use modular supervisory control of DES to reduce computation complexity and increase the robustness and reliability of control. Modular supervisory control allows us to predict and mitigate cascading failures in power systems more effectively. We implemented the proposed control technique on a simulation platform developed in MATLAB and applied the proposed DES controller. The calculations of modular supervisory control of DES are performed using an external tool and imported into the MATLAB platform. We conduct simulation studies for the IEEE 30-bus, 118-bus and 300-bus systems, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p>

Reserve requirements for the VPPs are determined based on system frequency response and safety constraints, ensuring efficient grid support. Furthermore, an energy-based allocation model decomposes power injections for each IBR, accounting for their specific limitations. Numerical experiments validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, highlighting significant financial gains for VPPs, especially as system inertia decreases due to higher renewable energy integration.</p>

The method uncovers the most effective instability mitigation actions for both device-level and system-level investigations. The particular structure of the admittance and nodal models is exploited in the detailed derivation of the passivity sensitivity expressions. These proposed sensitivities are validated for different parameters at device-level and at system-level. Compared to previous stability and sensitivity methods, it does not require detailed system information, such as exact system eigenvalues, while it provides valuable information for a less conservative stable system design. In addition, we demonstrate how to utilize the proposed method through case studies with different converter controls and system-wide insights showing its general applicability.</p>

            <p>With the development of artificial intelligence integrated next-generation communication networks, mobile users (MUs) are increasingly demanding the efficient processing of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs. Fortunately, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) supported mobile edge computing (MEC) is regarded as an effective solution, offering the MUs multi-tier and efficient computing services. In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Parametric Stability Certificates for Grid-Forming Converter Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler, Steven Low</p>
            <p>We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</p>

            <h2>Open Datasets for Grid Modeling and Visualization: An Alberta Power Network Case</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Cheng, Yize Chen</p>
            <p>In the power and energy industry, multiple entities in grid operational logs are frequently recorded and updated. Thanks to recent advances in IT facilities and smart metering services, a variety of datasets such as system load, generation mix, and grid connection are often publicly available. While these resources are valuable in evaluating power grid's operational conditions and system resilience, the lack of fine-grained, accurate locational information constrain the usage of current data, which further hinders the development of smart grid and renewables integration. For instance, electricity end users are not aware of nodal generation mix or carbon emissions, while the general public have limited understanding about the effect of demand response or renewables integration if only the whole system's demands and generations are available. In this work, we focus on recovering power grid topology and line flow directions from open public dataset. Taking the Alberta grid as a working example, we start from mapping multi-modal power system datasets to the grid topology integrated with geographical information. By designing a novel optimization-based scheme to recover line flow directions, we are able to analyze and visualize the interactions between generations and demand vectors in an efficient manner. Proposed research is fully open-sourced and highly generalizable, which can help model and visualize grid information, create synthetic dataset, and facilitate analytics and decision-making framework for clean energy transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Mohammadian, Anna Van Boven, Kyri Baker</p>
            <p>Electric power grids are essential components of modern life, delivering reliable power to end-users while adhering to a multitude of engineering constraints and requirements. In grid operations, the Optimal Power Flow problem plays a key role in determining cost-effective generator dispatch that satisfies load demands and operational limits. However, due to stressed operating conditions, volatile demand profiles, and increased generation from intermittent energy sources, this optimization problem may become infeasible, posing risks such as voltage instability and line overloads. This study proposes a learning framework that combines machine learning with counterfactual explanations to automatically diagnose and restore feasibility in the OPF problem. Our method provides transparent and actionable insights by methodically identifying infeasible conditions and suggesting minimal demand response actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on IEEE 30-bus and 300-bus systems, demonstrating its capability to recover feasibility with high success rates and generating diverse corrective options, appropriate for real-time decision-making. These preliminary findings illustrate the potential of combining classical optimization with explainable AI techniques to enhance grid reliability and resilience.</p>

            <p>To transition towards a carbon-neutral power system, considerable amounts of renewable energy generation capacity are being installed in the North Sea area. Consequently, projects aggregating many gigawatts of power generation capacity and transmitting renewable energy to the main load centers are being developed. Given the electrical challenges arising from having bulk power capacity in a compact geographical area with several connections to the main grid, and a lack of a robust definition identifying the type of system under study, this paper proposes a general technical definition of such projects introducing the term Electrical Energy Hub (EEH). The concept, purpose, and functionalities of EEHs are introduced in the text, emphasizing the importance of a clear technical definition for future planning procedures, grid codes, regulations, and support schemes for EEHs and multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) grids in general. Furthermore, the unique electrical challenges associated with integrating EEHs into the power system are discussed. Three research areas of concern are identified, namely control, planning, and protection. Through this analysis, insights are provided into the effective implementation of multi-GW scale EEH projects and their integration into the power grid through multiple interconnections. Finally, a list of ongoing and planned grid development projects is evaluated to assess whether they fall within the EEH category</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samantha Israel, Sanjana Kunkolienkar, Ana Goulart, Kate Davis, Thomas Overbye</p>
            <p>Power grids and their cyber infrastructure are classified as Critical Energy Infrastructure/Information (CEII) and are not publicly accessible. While realistic synthetic test cases for power systems have been developed in recent years, they often lack corresponding cyber network models. This work extends synthetic grid models by incorporating cyber-physical representations. To address the growing need for realistic and scalable models that integrate both cyber and physical layers in electric power systems, this paper presents the Scalable Automatic Model Generation Tool (SAM-GT). This tool enables the creation of large-scale cyber-physical topologies for power system models. The resulting cyber-physical network models include power system switches, routers, and firewalls while accounting for data flows and industrial communication protocols. Case studies demonstrate the tool's application to synthetic grid models of 500, 2,000, and 10,000 buses, considering three distinct network topologies. Results from these case studies include network metrics on critical nodes, hops, and generation times, showcasing effectiveness, adaptability, and scalability of SAM-GT.</p>

            <p>We provide an open-access dataset of phasor & waveform measurement units (PMUs/WMUs) of a real-world electrical distribution network. The network consists of diverse sets of generation resources (including solar panels, fuel cells, natural gas generators, and utility interconnections), loads (including large-scale electric vehicle charging, data centers, central cooling, offices), topology changes (such as line outages and load transfers), as well as a mixture of single- and three-phase networks. We describe a densely deployed PMU sensor network in a distribution grid, in which all buses with non-zero power injections are measured. This approach enables a range of applications such as state estimation, system identification, power flow optimization, and feedback control, several of which are discussed in this paper. Additionally, we provide a synchronized waveform dataset which allows the analysis of harmonics, transient events, dynamic grid impedance, and stability. Data collection started in 2023 while new data is generated continuously and made available online. A characterization of measurement error is provided. Finally, we provide circuit topology and parameters as a part of the dataset. Together, the circuit and timeseries data offer an opportunity for researchers to develop and test algorithms on a real-world system.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Duration of Reserve Capacity Ancillary Services for Distributed Energy Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Zapparoli, Blazhe Gjorgiev, Giovanni Sansavini</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into power systems presents opportunities and challenges for ancillary services (AS) provision. Technical requirements of existing AS (i.e., duration, reliability, ramp rate, and lead time) have been designed for traditional generating units, making their provision by DER aggregates particularly challenging. This paper proposes a method to design the duration of reserve capacity AS products considering the operational constraints of DERs and the temporal dynamics of system imbalances. The optimal product duration is determined by maximizing product availability and aligning the supply profile with the system's balancing needs. We apply the methodology to a realistic Swiss low-voltage network with a diverse DER portfolio. The results reveal that (i) shorter product durations maximize average availability and (ii) long product durations improve the alignment with system balancing needs. This paper offers valuable insights for system operators to design AS products tailored for DER participation.</p>

            <p>This letter proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems.

The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</p>

            <h2>Distribution Grids May Be a Barrier To Residential Electrification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyadarshan, Constance Crozier, Kyri Baker, Kevin Kircher</p>
            <p>Replacing fossil-fueled appliances and vehicles with electric alternatives can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in many settings. However, residential electrification can also raise electricity demand beyond the safe limits of electrical infrastructure. This can increase the risk of blackouts or require grid reinforcement that is often slow and expensive. Here, we estimate the physical and economic impacts on distribution grids of electrifying all housing and personal vehicles in each county of the lower 48 United States. We find that space heating is the main driver of grid impacts, with the coldest regions seeing demand peaks up to five times higher than today's peaks. Accommodating electrification of all housing and personal vehicles is estimated to require 600 GW of distribution grid reinforcement nationally, at a cost of \$350 to \$790 billion, or \$2,800 to \$6,400 per household (95% confidence intervals). However, demand-side management could eliminate three-quarters of grid reinforcement costs.</p>

            <h2>Inverter Output Impedance Estimation in Power Networks: A Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive-Least-Square Algorithm Based Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaesang Park, Alireza Askarian, Srinivasa Salapaka</p>
            <p>As inverter-based loads and energy sources become increasingly prevalent, accurate estimation of line impedance between inverters and the grid is essential for optimizing performance and enhancing control strategies. This paper presents a non-invasive method for estimating output-line impedance using measurements local to the inverter. It provides a specific method for signal conditioning of signals measured at the inverter, which makes the measured data better suited to estimation algorithms. An algorithm based on the Variable Direction Forgetting Recursive Least Squares (VDF-RLS) method is introduced, which leverages these conditioned signals for precise impedance estimation. The signal conditioning process transforms measurements into the direct-quadrature (dq) coordinate frame, where the rotating frame frequency is determined to facilitate a simpler and more accurate estimation. This frequency is implemented using a secondary Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to attenuate grid voltage measurement variations. By isolating the variation-sensitive q-axis and relying solely on the less sensitive d-axis, the method further minimizes the impact of variations. The VDF-RLS estimation method achieves rapid adaptation while ensuring stability in the absence of persistent excitation by selectively discarding outdated data during updates. Proposed conditioning and estimation methods are non-invasive; estimations are solely done using measured outputs, and no signal is injected into the power network. Simulation results demonstrate a significant improvement in impedance estimation stability, particularly in low-excitation conditions, where the VDF-RLS method achieves more than three time lower error compared to existing approaches such as constant forgetting RLS and the Kalman filter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Salma M. Elsherif, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>Chlorine, the most widely used disinfectant, needs to be adequately distributed in water distribution networks (WDNs) to maintain consistent residual levels and ensure water safety. This is performed through control node injections at the treatment plant via booster stations scattered in WDNs. While previous studies have applied various optimization metrics for booster station placement, many have failed to consider the coverage of the station injections and the dynamic nature of WDNs. In particular, variations in hydraulics and demand significantly impact the reachability and efficacy of chlorine injections which then impact optimal placement of booster stations. This study introduces a novel formulation that combines control- and graph-theoretic approaches to solve the booster station placement problem. Unlike traditional methods, our approach emphasizes maximizing the system's ability to control disinfectant levels with minimal energy, taking into account the time-varying hydraulic profiles that lead to different optimal station placements. We propose a simple weighting technique to determine the placements by assessing the structural controllability of each configuration, based on the network's topology and independent of specific parameters like decay rates or pipe roughness. This method ensures effective chlorine coverage across the network. Our approach is validated on different networks, demonstrating its operational effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.</p>

            <p>Fleets of robo-taxis offering on-demand transportation services, commonly known as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems, hold significant promise for societal benefits, such as reducing pollution, energy consumption, and urban congestion. However, orchestrating these systems at scale remains a critical challenge, with existing coordination algorithms often failing to exploit the systems' full potential. This work introduces a novel decision-making framework that unites mathematical modeling with data-driven techniques. In particular, we present the AMoD coordination problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework that exploits the main strengths of graph representation learning, reinforcement learning, and classical operations research tools. Extensive evaluations across diverse simulation fidelities and scenarios demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, achieving superior system performance, computational efficiency, and generalizability compared to prior methods. Finally, motivated by the need to democratize research efforts in this area, we release publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination alongside an open-source codebase designed to provide accessible simulation platforms and establish a standardized validation process for comparing methodologies.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Jiang, Xuezheng Wang, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) provides a promising solution for building energy modeling and can serve as a virtual environment to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact and learn. However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called "temperature response violation" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Almomani, Muhammad Sarwar, Venkataramana Ajjarapu</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel Short-Term Voltage Stability Index (STVSI), which leverages Lyapunov Exponent-based detection to assess and quantify short-term stability triggered by Over Excitation Limiters (OELs) or undamped oscillations in voltage. The proposed method is measurement-based and decomposes the voltage trajectory into two key components using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD): a residual part, which indicates delayed voltage recovery, and an oscillatory part, which captures oscillations. The residual component is critical, as it can detect activation of OELs in synchronous generators or Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) relays in inverter-based resources, potentially leading to instability within the quasisteady-state time frame. Meanwhile, the oscillatory component may indicate either a stable or unstable state in the short term. To accurately assess stability, STVSI employs an entropy-based metric to measure the proximity of the system to instability, with specific indices for short-term voltage stability based on oscillations and recovery. Simulations on the Nordic power system demonstrate that STVSI effectively identifies and categorizes voltage stability issues. Moreover, STVSI not only detects voltage stability conditions but also qualitatively assesses the extent of stability, providing a nuanced measure of stability.</p>

            <p>Ensuring accurate violation detection in power systems is paramount for operational reliability. This paper introduces an enhanced voltage recovery violation index (EVRVI), a comprehensive index designed to quantify fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR). EVRVI enhances traditional entropy-based methods by leveraging Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to extract key features from the voltage signal, which are then used to quantify over-voltage (OV) and under-voltage (UV) events. Our simulations on the Nordic system, involving over 245k scenarios, demonstrate EVRVI's superior ability to identify and categorize voltage recovery issues compared to the traditional entropy-based measure. EVRVI not only significantly reduces false negatives in violation detection but also provides a reliable framework for over-voltage detection, making it an invaluable tool for modern power system studies.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the evolution of modern power grids has been driven by the growing integration of remotely controlled grid assets. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) enhance operational efficiency, they also introduce cybersecurity risks.

To evaluate the resilience of energy systems under such threats, this study employs real-time simulation and a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus system that incorporates a Microgrid (MG) with solar-based IBR. The study assesses the impact of remote attacks impacting the MG stability under different levels of IBR penetrations through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. Namely, we analyze voltage, current, and frequency profiles before, during, and after cyberattack-induced disruptions. The results demonstrate that real-time HIL testing is a practical approach to uncover potential risks and develop robust mitigation strategies for resilient MG operations.</p>

            <p>Hybrid wind-wave energy system, integrating floating offshore wind turbine and wave energy converters, has received much attention in recent years due to its potential benefit in increasing the power harvest density and reducing the levelized cost of electricity. Apart from the design complexities of the hybrid wind-wave energy systems, their energy conversion efficiency, power output smoothness and their safe operations introduce new challenges for their control system designs. Recent studies show that advanced model-based control strategies have the great potential to significantly improve their overall control performance. However the performance of these advanced control strategies rely on the computationally efficient control-oriented models with sufficient fidelity, which are normally difficult to derive due to the complexity of the hydro-, aero-dynamic effects and the this http URL most available results, the hybrid wind-wave energy system models are established by using the Boundary Element Method, devoting to understanding the hydrodynamic responses and performance analysis.

            <p>The transition to renewable energy is driving the rise of distributed multi-energy systems, in which individual energy hubs and prosumers (e.g., homes, industrial campuses) generate, store, and trade energy. Economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) schemes are widely used to optimize operation of energy hubs by efficiently dispatching resources and minimizing costs while ensuring operational constraints are met. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among hubs enhances network efficiency and reduces costs but also increases computational and privacy challenges, especially as the network scales. Additionally, current distributed control techniques require global recomputation whenever the network topology changes, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a clustering-based P2P trading framework that enables plug-and-play operation, allowing energy hubs to seamlessly join or leave without requiring network-wide controller updates. The impact is restricted to the hubs within the affected cluster. The energy trading problem is formulated as a bi-level bargaining game, where inter-cluster trading commitments are determined at the cluster level, while energy dispatch and cost-sharing among hubs within a cluster are refined at the hub level. Both levels are solved in a distributed manner using ADMM, ensuring computational feasibility and privacy preservation. Moreover, we develop plug-and-play procedures to handle dynamic topology changes at both the hub and cluster levels, minimizing disruptions across the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed bi-level framework reduces operational costs, and enables scalable energy management under plug-and-play operation.</p>

First, we reformulate the output-feedback control problem as a state-feedback linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem with a controllable non-minimal state, which can be constructed from past input-output signals. Second, we propose a data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method for this non-minimal realization to achieve efficient output-feedback adaptive control. Third, we use high-fidelity simulations to verify that the output-feedback DeePO can effectively stabilize grid-connected power converters and quickly adapt to the changes in the power grid.</p>

            <p>Rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and frequency nadir should be considered in real-time frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) to ensure frequency stability of the modern power systems. Since calculating the frequency response is complex, deep neural network (DNN) could be adopted to capture the nonlinearities and estimate those two metrics accurately. Therefore, in this paper, a DNN-based frequency predictor is developed with the training data obtained from time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC. Subsequently, it is reformulated using a set of mixed-integer linear programming formulations and then embedded into the FCOPF framework as constraints to ensure grid frequency stability, creating the proposed DNN-FCOPF model. Two benchmark models, a traditional OPF without any frequency constraints and a linear system-wide RoCoF-constrained FCOPF, are also implemented to gauge the proposed DNN-FCOPF. Finally, the solutions obtained with these three models are compared and evaluated with time-domain simulations using PSCAD under various load profiles, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-FCOPF.</p>

            <h2>Large Wireless Model (LWM): A Foundation Model for Wireless Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadjad Alikhani, Gouranga Charan, Ahmed Alkhateeb</p>
            <p>This paper presents Large Wireless Model (LWM) -- the world's first foundation model for wireless channels. Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems. Towards this objective, LWM, which has a transformer-based architecture, was pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale wireless channel datasets. Our results show consistent improvements in downstream tasks when using the LWM embeddings compared to raw channel representations, especially in scenarios with high-complexity machine learning tasks and limited training datasets. This LWM's ability to learn from large-scale wireless data opens a promising direction for intelligent systems that can efficiently adapt to diverse tasks with limited data, paving the way for addressing key challenges in wireless communication and sensing systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Warat Kongkitkul, Sompote Youwai, Warut Sakulpojworachai</p>
            <p>This research introduces a novel dual-attention transformer architecture for predicting soil electrical resistivity, a critical parameter for high-voltage substation construction. Our model employs attention mechanisms operating across both features and data batches, enhanced by feature embedding layers that project inputs into higher-dimensional spaces. We implements Particle Swarm Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, systematically optimizing embedding dimensions, attention heads, and neural network architecture. The proposed architecture achieves superior predictive performance (Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 0.63%) compared to recent state of the art models for tabular data. Crucially, our model maintains explainability through SHapley Additive exPlanations value analysis, revealing that fine particle content and dry density are the most influential parameters affecting soil resistivity. We developes a web-based application implementing this model to provide engineers with an accessible decision support framework that bridges geotechnical and electrical engineering requirements for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. This integrated approach satisfies both structural stability and electrical safety standards, improving construction efficiency and safety compliance in high-voltage infrastructure implementation.</p>

            <h2>AI-Enhanced Resilience in Power Systems: Adversarial Deep Learning for Robust Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment under Cyber-Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Li, Shitu Zhang, Yuanzheng Li</p>
            <p>In the era of Industry 4.0, ensuring the resilience of cyber-physical systems against sophisticated cyber threats is increasingly critical. This study proposes a pioneering AI-based control framework that enhances short-term voltage stability assessments (STVSA) in power systems under complex composite cyber-attacks. First, by incorporating white-box and black-box adversarial attacks with Denial-of-Service (DoS) perturbations during training, composite adversarial attacks are implemented. Second, the application of Spectral Normalized Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (SNCWGAN-GP) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) strengthens the model's resistance to adversarial disturbances, improving data quality and training stability. Third, an assessment model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-enhanced Graph Attention Network (L-GAT) is developed to capture dynamic relationships between the post-fault dynamic trajectories and electrical grid topology. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method in composite cyber-attack scenarios. This contribution is pivotal to advancing AI-based resilient control strategies for nonlinear dynamical systems, marking a substantial enhancement in the security of cyber-physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Moving Target Defense Against Adversarial False Data Injection Attacks In Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yexiang Chen, Subhash Lakshminarayana, H. Vincent Poor</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML)-based detectors have been shown to be effective in detecting stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that can bypass conventional bad data detectors (BDDs) in power systems. However, ML models are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A sophisticated perturbation signal added to the original BDD-bypassing FDIA can conceal the attack from ML-based detectors. In this paper, we develop a moving target defense (MTD) strategy to defend against adversarial FDIAs in power grids. We first develop an MTD-strengthened deep neural network (DNN) model, which deploys a pool of DNN models rather than a single static model that cooperate to detect the adversarial attack jointly. The MTD model pool introduces randomness to the ML model's decision boundary, thereby making the adversarial attacks detectable. Furthermore, to increase the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and reduce the computational costs associated with developing the MTD model pool, we combine this approach with the physics-based MTD, which involves dynamically perturbing the transmission line reactance and retraining the DNN-based detector to adapt to the new system topology. Simulations conducted on IEEE test bus systems demonstrate that the MTD-strengthened DNN achieves up to 94.2% accuracy in detecting adversarial FDIAs. When combined with a physics-based MTD, the detection accuracy surpasses 99%, while significantly reducing the computational costs of updating the DNN models. This approach requires only moderate perturbations to transmission line reactances, resulting in minimal increases in OPF cost.</p>

            <h2>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries For Fast Frequency Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutong He, Guangchun Ruan, Haiwang Zhong</p>
            <p>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%-57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a bottom-up method to model baseline charging power demand and quantify available flexibility for large-scale BEV fleets. The method utilizes geographic and sociodemographic information to represent the fleet's mobility and driving energy needs. It models the charging decisions of drivers based on their driving energy needs and range comfort level using real-world data. The flexibility quantification provides an hourly maximum and minimum bound for the charging power and limits the amount of daily flexible charging energy. We apply the methodology to the future fully electrified fleet of Switzerland as a case study and compare the spatio-temporal characteristics of the charging demand and flexibility of different geographic areas and urbanization levels.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system applications.</p>

This paper focuses on developing a model-based simulation approach to predict and analyze the energy consumption of drayage trucks used in ports logistic operations, considering seasonal climate variations and geographical characteristics. The paper includes results for three major container ports within the United States, providing region-specific insights into driving range, payload capacity, and charging infrastructure requirements, which will inform decision-makers in integrating electric trucks into the existing drayage operations and plan investments for electric grid development.</p>

            <h2>Differentiable Optimization for Deep Learning-Enhanced DC Approximation of AC Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Rosemberg, Michael Klamkin</p>
            <p>The growing scale of power systems and the increasing uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources necessitates novel optimization techniques that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy, paving the way for more reliable and efficient power systems.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing the Role of the DSO in Electricity Trading of VPPs via a Stackelberg Game Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Xi Zhang, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources has sparked interests in participating in power markets. Here, we consider two settings where Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) with some flexible resources participate in the electricity trading, either directly in the wholesale electricity market, or interfaced by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) who is the transaction organizer. In order to study the role of DSO as a stakeholder, a Stackelberg game is represented via a bi-level model: the DSO maximizes profits at the upper level, while the VPPs minimize operating costs at the lower level. To solve this problem, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of lower level is deduced to achieve a single-level problem. The results show that the role of the DSO as an intermediary agent leads to a decrease in operating costs of the VPPs by organizing lower-level trading, while making a profit for itself. However, this seemingly win-win result comes at the cost of losing wholesale market interests, which implies that stakeholders need to abide by regulatory constraints in the electricity market.</p>

            <h2>Deep Learning Waveform Channel Modeling for Wideband Optical Fiber Transmission: Model Comparisons, Challenges and Potential Solutions</h2>

            <p>Fast and accurate waveform simulation is critical for understanding fiber channel characteristics, developing digital signal processing (DSP) technologies, optimizing optical network configurations, and advancing the optical fiber transmission system towards wideband. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for waveform modeling, offering high accuracy and low complexity compared to traditional split-step Fourier method (SSFM), due to its strong nonlinear fitting capabilities and efficient parallel computation. However, most DL methods are designed for few-channel and low-rate WDM systems, leaving their scalability to wideband systems uncertain. Moreover, the lack of a standardized accuracy evaluation method and the inconsistent results between waveform errors and transmission performance errors, hinders fair comparisons of various DL schemes. In this paper, we introduce a DSP-assisted accuracy evaluation method integrated with nonlinear DSP, providing a fair benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of DL models. Using this method, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of DL schemes, ranging from simple configurations to more complex wideband setups. The feature decoupled distributed method combining with bidirectional long short-term memory achieves the better performance compared to other DL schemes. Furthermore, in scenarios with more-channel and higher-rate, the performance advantages of FDD-BiLSTM will be further improved. However, as the number of channels and symbol rates increase, the performance of FDD-BiLSTM still gradually deteriorate. We analyze these challenges from three perspectives: the more intricate linear and nonlinear effects, the higher sampling rate required for SSFM. To address these challenges, we discuss potential solutions from two aspects: incorporating more prior physical knowledge and optimizing the structure of DL models.</p>

            <p>Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for optimal patient management. Differentiating between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study develops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed to classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right heart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test set (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training set. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process multimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH) sequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard deviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The discriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11), pre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +- 0.10). It has the potential to support clinical decision-making by effectively integrating multimodal data to assist physicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses.</p>

The method was first validated through simulations on a realistic solar plant model, then adapted and successfully tested in a 50 MW solar trough plant, demonstrating its advantages.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tannan Xiao, Ying Chen, Han Diao, Shaowei Huang, Chen Shen</p>
            <p>Power system optimal dispatch with transient security constraints is commonly represented as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based TSC-OPF trains efficient decision-making agents that are adaptable to various scenarios and provide solution results quickly. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state space and action spaces, as well as the non-smoothness of dynamic constraints, existing DRL-based TSC-OPF solution methods face a significant challenge of the sparse reward problem. To address this issue, a fast-converged DRL method for TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling of TSC-OPF is improved by reducing the observation space and smoothing the reward design, thus facilitating agent training. An improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Curriculum learning, Parallel exploration, and Ensemble decision-making (DDPG-CPEn) is introduced to drastically enhance the efficiency of agent training and the accuracy of decision-making. The effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through experiments in the IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid.

            <p>The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.</p>

At the system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to capture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we establish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by demonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madeleine Pollack, Ryan Piansky, Swati Gupta, Daniel Molzahn</p>
            <p>Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.</p>

            <p>Digital twins for power electronics require accurate power losses whose direct measurements are often impractical or impossible in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-based thermal modeling with data-driven techniques to identify and correct power losses accurately using only temperature measurements. Our approach leverages a cascaded architecture where a neural network learns to correct the outputs of a nominal power loss model by backpropagating through a reduced-order thermal model. We explore two neural architectures, a bootstrapped feedforward network, and a recurrent neural network, demonstrating that the bootstrapped feedforward approach achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. Between the interconnection, we included normalization strategies and physics-guided training loss functions to preserve stability and ensure physical consistency. Experimental results show that our hybrid model reduces both temperature estimation errors (from 7.2+-6.8°C to 0.3+-0.3°C) and power loss prediction errors (from 5.4+-6.6W to 0.2+-0.3W) compared to traditional physics-based approaches, even in the presence of thermal model uncertainties. This methodology allows us to accurately estimate power losses without direct measurements, making it particularly helpful for real-time industrial applications where sensor placement is hindered by cost and physical limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Tunkle, Kamal Abdulraheem, Linyu Lin, Majdi I. Radaideh</p>
            <p>The economic feasibility of nuclear microreactors will depend on minimizing operating costs through advancements in autonomous control, especially when these microreactors are operating alongside other types of energy systems (e.g., renewable energy). This study explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) for real-time drum control in microreactors, exploring performance in regard to load-following scenarios. By leveraging a point kinetics model with thermal and xenon feedback, we first establish a baseline using a single-output RL agent, then compare it against a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This study demonstrates that RL controllers, including both single- and multi-agent RL (MARL) frameworks, can achieve similar or even superior load-following performance as traditional PID control across a range of load-following scenarios. In short transients, the RL agent was able to reduce the tracking error rate in comparison to PID. Over extended 300-minute load-following scenarios in which xenon feedback becomes a dominant factor, PID maintained better accuracy, but RL still remained within a 1% error margin despite being trained only on short-duration scenarios. This highlights RL's strong ability to generalize and extrapolate to longer, more complex transients, affording substantial reductions in training costs and reduced overfitting. Furthermore, when control was extended to multiple drums, MARL enabled independent drum control as well as maintained reactor symmetry constraints without sacrificing performance -- an objective that standard single-agent RL could not learn. We also found that, as increasing levels of Gaussian noise were added to the power measurements, the RL controllers were able to maintain lower error rates than PID, and to do so with less control effort.</p>

            <p>The increasing deployment of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs) introduces cybersecurity challenges, particularly due to inherent vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to cyberattacks. The vulnerable points in EVCI are charging ports, which serve as the links between the EVs and the EVCI as they transfer the data along with the power. Data spoofing attacks targeting these ports can compromise security, reliability, and overall system performance by introducing anomalies in operational data. An efficient method for identifying the charging port current magnitude variations is presented in this research. The MATLAB/SIMULINK environment simulates an EVCI system for various data generating scenarios. A Temporal Convolution Network - Autoencoder (TCN-AE) model is used in training the multivariate time series data of EVCI and reconstructing it. The abnormalities in data are that various charging port current magnitudes are replaced with their respective data of different durations, thus enabling the replay attack scenarios. To detect anomalies, the error between the original and reconstructed data is computed, and these error values are used for detecting the anomalies. With the help of the mean vector and covariance matrices of the errors, the anomaly score is computed in the form of Mahalanobis distance. The threshold is obtained from the short sub-sequence of the errors and optimized for the whole time series data. The obtained optimal threshold is compared with the anomaly score to detect the anomaly. The model demonstrates robust performance in data reconstruction by identifying anomalies with an accuracy of 99.64%, to enhance the reliability and security in operations of EVCI.</p>

            <h2>Aggregate Flexibility of Thermostatically Controlled Loads using Generalized Polymatroids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Mukhi, Alessandro Abate</p>
            <p>Leveraging populations of thermostatically controlled loads could provide vast storage capacity to the grid. To realize this potential, their flexibility must be accurately aggregated and represented to the system operator as a single, controllable virtual device. Mathematically this is computed by calculating the Minkowski sum of the individual flexibility of each of the devices. Previous work showed how to exactly characterize the flexibility of lossless storage devices as generalized polymatroids-a family of polytope that enable an efficient computation of the Minkowski sum. In this paper we build on these results to encompass devices with dissipative storage dynamics. In doing so we are able to provide tractable methods of accurately characterizing the flexibility in populations consisting of a variety of heterogeneous devices. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed characterizations are tight.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Pricing for Optimal Coordination in Networked Energy Systems with Nonsmooth Cost Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayi Li, Jiale Wei, Matthew Motoki, Yan Jiang, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>Incentive-based coordination mechanisms for distributed energy consumption have shown promise in aligning individual user objectives with social welfare, especially under privacy constraints. Our prior work proposed a two-timescale adaptive pricing framework, where users respond to prices by minimizing their local cost, and the system operator iteratively updates the prices based on aggregate user responses. A key assumption was that the system cost need to smoothly depend on the aggregate of the user demands. In this paper, we relax this assumption by considering the more realistic model of where the cost are determined by solving a DCOPF problem with constraints. We present a generalization of the pricing update rule that leverages the generalized gradients of the system cost function, which may be nonsmooth due to the structure of DCOPF. We prove that the resulting dynamic system converges to a unique equilibrium, which solves the social welfare optimization problem. Our theoretical results provide guarantees on convergence and stability using tools from nonsmooth analysis and Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations on networked energy systems illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <h2>Robust Continuous-Time Generation Scheduling under Power Demand Uncertainty: An Affine Decision Rule Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngchae Cho, Insoon Yang, Takayuki Ishizaki</p>
            <p>Most existing generation scheduling models for power systems under demand uncertainty rely on energy-based formulations with a finite number of time periods, which may fail to ensure that power supply and demand are balanced continuously over time. To address this issue, we propose a robust generation scheduling model in a continuous-time framework, employing a decision rule approach. First, for a given set of demand trajectories, we formulate a general robust generation scheduling problem to determine a decision rule that maps these demand trajectories and time points to the power outputs of generators. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate of it as our model by carefully designing a class of decision rules that are affine in the current demand, with coefficients invariant over time and constant terms that are continuous piecewise affine functions of time. As a result, our model can be recast as a finite-dimensional linear program to determine the coefficients and the function values of the constant terms at each breakpoint, solvable via the cutting-plane method. Our model is non-anticipative unlike most existing continuous-time models, which use Bernstein polynomials, making it more practical. We also provide illustrative numerical examples.</p>

            <h2>Battery Operations in Electricity Markets: Strategic Behavior and Distortions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerry Anunrojwong, Santiago R. Balseiro, Omar Besbes, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out variations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow from their role as marginal "price-takers" to significant players in the market, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity markets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort decisions compared to centralized batteries? We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of the highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting battery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no battery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing battery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge decisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e., discharging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in participation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its discharge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time responsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand than centrally optimal. We also quantify the impact of the battery market power on total system cost via the Price of Anarchy metric, and prove that the it is always between $9/8$ and $4/3$. That is, incentive misalignment always exists, but it is bounded even in the worst case. We calibrate our model to real data from Los Angeles and Houston. Lastly, we show that competition is very effective at reducing distortions, but many market power mitigation mechanisms backfire, and lead to higher total cost.</p>

            <h2>Qieemo: Speech Is All You Need in the Emotion Recognition in Conversations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinming Chen, Jingyi Fang, Yuanzhong Zheng, Yaoxuan Wang, Haojun Fei</p>
            <p>Emotion recognition plays a pivotal role in intelligent human-machine interaction systems. Multimodal approaches benefit from the fusion of diverse modalities, thereby improving the recognition accuracy. However, the lack of high-quality multimodal data and the challenge of achieving optimal alignment between different modalities significantly limit the potential for improvement in multimodal approaches. In this paper, the proposed Qieemo framework effectively utilizes the pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) model backbone which contains naturally frame aligned textual and emotional features, to achieve precise emotion classification solely based on the audio modality. Furthermore, we design the multimodal fusion (MMF) module and cross-modal attention (CMA) module in order to fuse the phonetic posteriorgram (PPG) and emotional features extracted by the ASR encoder for improving recognition accuracy. The experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that Qieemo outperforms the benchmark unimodal, multimodal, and self-supervised models with absolute improvements of 3.0%, 1.2%, and 1.9% respectively.</p>

            <h2>Sensorless Field Oriented Control of CSI-Fed PMSM Drives Used in Submersible Pumps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Bahrami-Fard, Majid Ghasemi Korrani, Babak Fahimi</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a practical startup strategy for current source inverter (CSI)-fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drives in submersible pump applications, focusing on ensuring a seamless shift to sensorless field-oriented control (FOC). The method effectively manages the transition to sensorless operation without requiring precise current or alignment error calculations, thereby simplifying implementation. By addressing speed and current oscillations directly during the startup and transition stages, the approach significantly enhances overall system stability and responsiveness. Validation through simulation and experimental testing demonstrates the strategy's success in maintaining low oscillation levels across various operating conditions, confirming its reliability for high-performance industrial applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli</p>
            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Varsha N. Behrunani, Philipp Heer, Roy S. Smith, John Lygeros</p>
            <p>Peer-to-peer(P2P) energy trading may increase efficiency and reduce costs, but introduces significant challenges for network operators such as maintaining grid reliability, accounting for network losses, and redistributing costs equitably. We propose a novel loss-aware pricing strategy for P2P energy markets that addresses these challenges while incentivizing participation in the cooperative energy trading market. The problem is formulated as a hierarchical Stackelberg game, where a grid operator determines network tariffs while prosumers optimize their trades based on these tariffs while guaranteeing that network constraints are satisfied. The algorithm is designed to minimize and recover their cost from the trading parties, while also minimizing the total cost of the hubs. The mechanism dynamically adjusts tariffs based on location and network topology, discouraging loss-intensive trades. Finally, the complete framework includes the computation of fair trading prices, ensuring all market participants benefit equitably. An ADMM-based hyper-gradient descent method is proposed for solving this problem. Extensive numerical simulations using the benchmark IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate significant cost reductions and improved network efficiency through reduction in network losses compared to constant tariff schemes. Results highlight the adaptability and scalability of the proposed mechanism to varying network configurations and size, demand profiles, and seasonal conditions.</p>

            <p>Grid-Forming (GFM) technology is considered a promising solution to build power electronics-dominated power systems. However, the impact of GFM converters on the system stability is still unquantified, creating a gap between the system- and device-level perspectives. To fill this gap, at the device-level, we propose a Forming Index to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage variations, providing a characterization of its GFM behavior. At the system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to capture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we establish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by demonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Dumas, Sébastien Finet, Nathalie Grisey, Ibtissam Hamdane, Paul Plessiez</p>
            <p>This paper examines the relationship between system imbalance and several explanatory variables within the French electricity system. The factors considered include lagged imbalance values, observations of renewable energy sources (RES) generation and consumption, and forecasts for RES generation and consumption. The study analyzes the distribution of system imbalance in relation to these variables. Additionally, an HGBR machine-learning model is employed to assess the predictability of imbalances and the explanatory power of the input variables studied. The results indicate no clear correlation between RES generation or consumption and the observed imbalances. However, it is possible to predict the imbalance adequately using forecasts available a few hours before real-time, along with the lagged values of the imbalance. Predicting the imbalance a day in advance proves to be complex with the variables examined; however, the extreme quantiles of the imbalance used for reserve sizing and contracting can be predicted with sufficient accuracy.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant variability and uncertainty in modern power systems, making accurate state prediction critical for reliable grid operation. Conventional forecasting methods often neglect the power grid's inherent topology, limiting their ability to capture complex spatio temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a topology aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for predicting power system states under high renewable integration. We construct a graph based representation of the power network, modeling buses and transmission lines as nodes and edges, and introduce a specialized GNN architecture that integrates GraphSAGE convolutions with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model both spatial and temporal correlations in system dynamics. The model is trained and evaluated on the NREL 118 test system using realistic, time synchronous renewable generation profiles. Our results show that the proposed GNN outperforms baseline approaches including fully connected neural networks, linear regression, and rolling mean models, achieving substantial improvements in predictive accuracy. The GNN achieves average RMSEs of 0.13 to 0.17 across all predicted variables and demonstrates consistent performance across spatial locations and operational conditions.

            <h2>Dual Audio-Centric Modality Coupling for Talking Head Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ao Fu, Ziqi Ni, Yi Zhou</p>
            <p>The generation of audio-driven talking head videos is a key challenge in computer vision and graphics, with applications in virtual avatars and digital media. Traditional approaches often struggle with capturing the complex interaction between audio and facial dynamics, leading to lip synchronization and visual quality issues. In this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based framework, Dual Audio-Centric Modality Coupling (DAMC), which effectively integrates content and dynamic features from audio inputs. By leveraging a dual encoder structure, DAMC captures semantic content through the Content-Aware Encoder and ensures precise visual synchronization through the Dynamic-Sync Encoder. These features are fused using a Cross-Synchronized Fusion Module (CSFM), enhancing content representation and lip synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in key metrics such as lip synchronization accuracy and image quality, demonstrating robust generalization across various audio inputs, including synthetic speech from text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our results provide a promising solution for high-quality, audio-driven talking head generation and present a scalable approach for creating realistic talking heads.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have opened new avenues for dynamic data collection in challenging environments, such as sports fields during fast-paced sports action. For the purposes of monitoring sport events for dangerous injuries, we envision a coordinated UAV fleet designed to capture high-quality, multi-view video footage of collision events in real-time. The extracted video data is crucial for analyzing athletes' motions and investigating the probability of sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) during impacts. This research implemented a UAV fleet system on the NetLogo platform, utilizing custom collision detection algorithms to compare against traditional TV-coverage strategies. Our system supports decentralized data capture and autonomous processing, providing resilience in the rapidly evolving dynamics of sports collisions. The collaboration algorithm integrates both shared and local data to generate multi-step analyses aimed at determining the efficacy of custom methods in enhancing the accuracy of TBI prediction models. Missions are simulated in real-time within a two-dimensional model, focusing on the strategic capture of collision events that could lead to TBI, while considering operational constraints such as rapid UAV maneuvering and optimal positioning. Preliminary results from the NetLogo simulations suggest that custom collision detection methods offer superior performance over standard TV-coverage strategies by enabling more precise and timely data capture. This comparative analysis highlights the advantages of tailored algorithmic approaches in critical sports safety applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Declan Jagt, Sergei Chernyshenko, Matthew Peet</p>
            <p>Periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes on large or infinite domains using PDEs on finite intervals, assuming solutions within the interval to extend periodically to the larger domain. However, stability analysis of PDEs with periodic boundary conditions is complicated by underlying uniform solutions admitted by these conditions, potentially giving rise to non-isolated equilibria. To resolve this issue, in this paper, it is shown how such underlying solutions for linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions can be modeled separately using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any vector-valued function satisfying such boundary conditions is uniquely defined by its second-order derivative and some uniform or affine function, parameterized by auxiliary variables in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both the second-order derivative and auxiliary variables. Finally, a stability test for the PIE representation is formulated as a linear operator inequality, which can be solved using semidefinite programming. The proposed methodology is applied to two PDE examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</p>

            <p>Fitness can help to strengthen muscles, increase resistance to diseases, and improve body shape. Nowadays, a great number of people choose to exercise at home/office rather than at the gym due to lack of time. However, it is difficult for them to get good fitness effects without professional guidance. Motivated by this, we propose the first personalized fitness monitoring system, HearFit+, using smart speakers at home/office. We explore the feasibility of using acoustic sensing to monitor fitness. We design a fitness detection method based on Doppler shift and adopt the short time energy to segment fitness actions. Based on deep learning, HearFit+ can perform fitness classification and user identification at the same time. Combined with incremental learning, users can easily add new actions. We design 4 evaluation metrics (i.e., duration, intensity, continuity, and smoothness) to help users to improve fitness effects. Through extensive experiments including over 9,000 actions of 10 types of fitness from 12 volunteers, HearFit+ can achieve an average accuracy of 96.13% on fitness classification and 91% accuracy for user identification. All volunteers confirm that HearFit+ can help improve the fitness effect in various environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Jaeho Lee</p>
            <p>Spoken dialogue systems powered by large language models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding human speech and generating appropriate spoken responses. However, these systems struggle with end-turn detection (ETD) -- the ability to distinguish between user turn completion and hesitation. This limitation often leads to premature or delayed responses, disrupting the flow of spoken conversations. In this paper, we introduce the ETD Dataset, the first public dataset for end-turn detection. The ETD dataset consists of both synthetic speech data generated with text-to-speech models and real-world speech data collected from web sources. We also propose SpeculativeETD, a novel collaborative inference framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to improve real-time ETD in resource-constrained environments. Our approach jointly employs a lightweight GRU-based model, which rapidly detects the non-speaking units in real-time on local devices, and a high-performance Wav2vec-based model running on the server to make a more challenging classification of distinguishing turn ends from mere pauses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpeculativeETD significantly improves ETD accuracy while keeping the required computations low. Datasets and code will be available after the review.</p>

Traditional methods of teaching these rules are limited by the availability of qualified instructors and time constraints. Automatic evaluation of recitation can address these challenges by providing prompt feedback and supporting independent practice. This study focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify three Tajweed rules - separate stretching (Al Mad), tight noon (Ghunnah), and hide (Ikhfaa) - using the publicly available QDAT dataset, which contains over 1,500 audio recordings. The input data consisted of audio recordings from this dataset, transformed into normalized mel-spectrograms. For classification, the EfficientNet-B0 architecture was used, enhanced with a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. The developed model achieved accuracy rates of 95.35%, 99.34%, and 97.01% for the respective rules. An analysis of the learning curves confirmed the model's robustness and absence of overfitting.

            <h2>Bridging conformal prediction and scenario optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niall O'Sullivan, Licio Romao, Kostas Margellos</p>
            <p>Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.</p>

            <h2>Remarks on the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality and the convergence of gradient systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>
            <p>This work explores generalizations of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality (PLI) and their implications for the convergence behavior of gradient flows in optimization problems. Motivated by the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (CT-LQR) policy optimization problem -- where only a weaker version of the PLI is characterized in the literature -- this work shows that while weaker conditions are sufficient for global convergence to, and optimality of the set of critical points of the cost function, the "profile" of the gradient flow solution can change significantly depending on which "flavor" of inequality the cost satisfies. After a general theoretical analysis, we focus on fitting the CT-LQR policy optimization problem to the proposed framework, showing that, in fact, it can never satisfy a PLI in its strongest form. We follow up our analysis with a brief discussion on the difference between continuous- and discrete-time LQR policy optimization, and end the paper with some intuition on the extension of this framework to optimization problems with L1 regularization and solved through proximal gradient flows.</p>

            <h2>An extrapolated and provably convergent algorithm for nonlinear matrix decomposition with the ReLU function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Gillis, Margherita Porcelli, Giovanni Seraghiti</p>
            <p>Nonlinear matrix decomposition (NMD) with the ReLU function, denoted ReLU-NMD, is the following problem: given a sparse, nonnegative matrix $X$ and a factorization rank $r$, identify a rank-$r$ matrix $\Theta$ such that $X\approx \max(0,\Theta)$. This decomposition finds application in data compression, matrix completion with entries missing not at random, and manifold learning. The standard ReLU-NMD model minimizes the least squares error, that is, $\|X - \max(0,\Theta)\|_F^2$. The corresponding optimization problem is nondifferentiable and highly nonconvex. This motivated Saul to propose an alternative model, Latent-ReLU-NMD, where a latent variable $Z$ is introduced and satisfies $\max(0,Z)=X$ while minimizing $\|Z - \Theta\|_F^2$ (``A nonlinear matrix decomposition for mining the zeros of sparse data'', SIAM J. Math. Data Sci., 2022). Our first contribution is to show that the two formulations may yield different low-rank solutions $\Theta$; in particular, we show that Latent-ReLU-NMD can be ill-posed when ReLU-NMD is not, meaning that there are instances in which the infimum of Latent-ReLU-NMD is not attained while that of ReLU-NMD is. We also consider another alternative model, called 3B-ReLU-NMD, which parameterizes $\Theta=WH$, where $W$ has $r$ columns and $H$ has $r$ rows, allowing one to get rid of the rank constraint in Latent-ReLU-NMD. Our second contribution is to prove the convergence of a block coordinate descent (BCD) applied to 3B-ReLU-NMD and referred to as BCD-NMD. Our third contribution is a novel extrapolated variant of BCD-NMD, dubbed eBCD-NMD, which we prove is also convergent under mild assumptions. We illustrate the significant acceleration effect of eBCD-NMD compared to BCD-NMD, and also show that eBCD-NMD performs well against the state of the art on synthetic and real-world data sets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinliang Dai, Yuning Jiang, Yi Guo, Colin N. Jones, Moritz Diehl, Veit Hagenmeyer</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Otacilio B. L. Neto, Michela Mulas, Francesco Corona</p>
            <p>This work proposes an algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria (GFNE) in noncooperative dynamic games. The focus is on cyber-physical systems with dynamics which are linear, stochastic, potentially unstable, and partially observed. We employ System Level Synthesis (SLS) to reformulate the problem as the search for an equilibrium profile of closed-loop responses to noise, which can then be used to reconstruct a stabilising output-feedback policy. Under this setup, we leverage monotone operator theory to design a GFNE-seeking algorithm capable to enforce closed-loop stability, operational constraints, and communication constraints onto the control policies. This algorithm is amenable to numerical implementation and we provide conditions for its convergence. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated experiment on the noncooperative stabilisation of a decentralised power-grid.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Monika Pytlarz, Adrian Onicas, Alessandro Crimi</p>
            <p>Cross-modal augmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and microscopic imaging based on the same tissue samples is promising because it can allow histopathological analysis in the absence of an underlying invasive biopsy procedure. Here, we tested a method for generating microscopic histological images from MRI scans of the corpus callosum using conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first multimodal translation of the brain MRI to histological volumetric representation of the same sample. The technique was assessed by training paired image translation models taking sets of images from MRI scans and microscopy. The use of cGAN for this purpose is challenging because microscopy images are large in size and typically have low sample availability. The current work demonstrates that the framework reliably synthesizes histology images from MRI scans of corpus callosum, emphasizing the network's ability to train on high resolution histologies paired with relatively lower-resolution MRI scans. With the ultimate goal of avoiding biopsies, the proposed tool can be used for educational purposes.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{á}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors. The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</p>

            <p>The signal differentiation problem involves the development of algorithms that allow to recover a signal's derivatives from noisy measurements. This paper develops a first-order differentiator with the following combination of properties: robustness to measurement noise, exactness in the absence of noise, optimal worst-case differentiation error, and Lipschitz continuous output where the output's Lipschitz constant is a tunable parameter. This combination of advantageous properties is not shared by any existing differentiator. Both continuous-time and sample-based versions of the differentiator are developed and theoretical guarantees are established for both. The continuous-time version of the differentiator consists in a regularized and sliding-mode-filtered linear adaptive differentiator. The sample-based, implementable version is then obtained through appropriate discretization. An illustrative example is provided to highlight the features of the developed differentiator.</p>

            <p>Uncrewed Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network (e.g., mobile base stations) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how uncrewed vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potential at this intersection.</p>

            <h2>Rational-Exponent Filters with Applications to Generalized Exponent Filters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samiya A Alkhairy</p>
            <p>We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second-order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Exponent Filters (GEFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-exponent GEFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters without additional complexity in causality and stability analyses compared with classical filters. In the case of GEFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</p>

            <p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control strategy suited for flood control of water resources infrastructure. Despite many studies on reservoir flood control and their theoretical contribution, optimisation methodologies have not been widely applied in real-time operation due to disparities between research assumptions and practical requirements. To address this gap, we include practical objectives, such as minimising the magnitude and frequency of changes in the existing outflow schedule. Incorporating these objectives transforms the problem into a multi-objective nonlinear optimisation problem that is difficult to solve in real-time. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that the weights and some parameters, considered the operators' preferences, vary depending on the system state. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that converts the original intractable problem into parameterized linear MPC problems with dynamic optimisation of weights and parameters. This is done by introducing a model-based learning concept. We refer to this framework as Parameterised Dynamic MPC (PD-MPC). The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a numerical experiment for the Daecheong multipurpose reservoir in South Korea. We find that PD-MPC outperforms standard MPC-based designs without a dynamic optimisation process for the objective weights and model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the weights and parameters vary with changing hydrological conditions.</p>

            <p>To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</p>

            <h2>On the Uniqueness of Participation Factors in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianwei Xia, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</p>

            <p>Large intelligent surface (LIS) has gained momentum as a potential 6G-enabling technology that expands the benefits of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). On the other hand, orthogonal space-division multiplexing (OSDM) may give a promising direction for efficient exploitation of the spatial resources, analogous as what is achieved with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the frequency domain. To this end, we study how to enforce channel orthogonality in a panel-based LIS (P-LIS) scenario. Our proposed method consists of having a subset of active LIS-panels coherently serving a set of users, and another subset of LIS-panels operating in a novel low-power mode by implementing a receive and re-transmit (RRTx) process. This results in an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel, where we characterize the RRTx processing required to achieve simultaneous orthogonality in time and space. We then employ the remaining degrees of freedom (DoFs) from the orthogonality constraint to minimize the RRTx processing power, where we derive a closed-form global minimizer, allowing for efficient implementation of the proposed scheme.</p>

Existing methods often overlook the effect of room geometry, particularly wall occlusions on sound propagation, making them less accurate in multi-room environments. In this work, we propose a new approach called Scene Occlusion-aware Acoustic Field (SOAF) for accurate sound generation. Our approach derives a global prior for the sound field using distance-aware parametric sound-propagation modeling and then transforms it based on the scene structure learned from the input video. We extract features from the local acoustic field centered at the receiver using a Fibonacci Sphere to generate binaural audio for novel views with a direction-aware attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the real dataset RWAVS and the synthetic dataset SoundSpaces demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques in audio generation.</p>

Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.</p>

            <p>We introduce FusionRF, a novel framework for digital surface reconstruction from satellite multispectral and panchromatic images. Current work has demonstrated the increased accuracy of neural photogrammetry for surface reconstruction from optical satellite images compared to algorithmic methods. Common satellites produce both a panchromatic and multispectral image, which contain high spatial and spectral information respectively. Current neural reconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a pansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However, these methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps. FusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel cross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present in multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral and panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF also leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image characteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By optimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while performing reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening preprocessing step. We evaluate our method on multispectral and panchromatic satellite images from the WorldView-3 satellite in various locations, and show that FusionRF provides an average of 17% improvement in depth reconstruction accuracy, and renders sharp training and novel views.</p>

            <p>Background: Image reconstruction from highly undersampled 4D flow MRI data can be very time consuming and may result in significant underestimation of velocities depending on regularization, thereby limiting the applicability of the method. The objective of the present work was to develop a generalizable self-supervised deep learning-based framework for fast and accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled 4D flow MRI and to demonstrate the utility of the framework for aortic and cerebrovascular applications. Methods: The proposed deep-learning-based framework, called FlowMRI-Net, employs physics-driven unrolled optimization using a complex-valued convolutional recurrent neural network and is trained in a self-supervised manner. The generalizability of the framework is evaluated using aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI acquisitions acquired on systems from two different vendors for various undersampling factors (R=8,16,24) and compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS-LLR) and deep learning-based (FlowVN) reconstructions. Evaluation includes an ablation study and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of image and velocity magnitudes. Results: FlowMRI-Net outperforms CS-LLR and FlowVN for aortic 4D flow MRI reconstruction, resulting in significantly lower vectorial normalized root mean square error and mean directional errors for velocities in the thoracic aorta. Furthermore, the feasibility of FlowMRI-Net's generalizability is demonstrated for cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI reconstruction, where no FlowVN can be trained due to the lack of high-quality reference data. Reconstruction times ranged from 3 to 7 minutes on commodity CPU/GPU hardware. Conclusion: FlowMRI-Net enables fast and accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI, with possible applications to other vascular territories.</p>

To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks.

            <p>The fusion of speech and language in the era of large language models has garnered significant attention. Discrete speech token is often utilized in text-to-speech tasks for speech compression and portability, which is convenient for joint training with text and have good compression efficiency.

Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective continuous speech tokenizer named Cont-SPT, and a text-to-speech model based on continuous speech tokens. Our results show that the speech language model based on the continuous speech tokenizer has better continuity and higher estimated Mean Opinion Scores (MoS). This enhancement is attributed to better information preservation rate of the continuous speech tokenizer across both low and high frequencies in the frequency domain.

            <p>Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.

            <h2>Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Chen, Ruiguo Zhong, Kehua Chen, Zhiwei Shang, Meixin Zhu, Edward Chung</p>
            <p>Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</p>

            <h2>MoMuSE: Momentum Multi-modal Target Speaker Extraction for Real-time Scenarios with Impaired Visual Cues</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjie Li, Ke Zhang, Shuai Wang, Kong Aik Lee, Man-Wai Mak, Haizhou Li</p>
            <p>Audio-visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to isolate the speech of a specific target speaker from an audio mixture using time-synchronized visual cues. In real-world scenarios, visual cues are not always available due to various impairments, which undermines the stability of AV-TSE. Despite this challenge, humans can maintain attentional momentum over time, even when the target speaker is not visible. In this paper, we introduce the Momentum Multi-modal target Speaker Extraction (MoMuSE), which retains a speaker identity momentum in memory, enabling the model to continuously track the target speaker. Designed for real-time inference, MoMuSE extracts the current speech window with guidance from both visual cues and dynamically updated speaker momentum. Experimental results demonstrate that MoMuSE exhibits significant improvement, particularly in scenarios with severe impairment of visual cues.</p>

            <h2>Certainty-Equivalence Model Predictive Control: Stability, Performance, and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changrui Liu, Shengling Shi, Bart De Schutter</p>
            <p>Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model-based controller design, particularly in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is effective in managing uncertainties, its conservatism often makes it less desirable in practice. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which relies on a nominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and low computational requirements. Contrary to the existing analyses where MPC has access to the true model, this paper investigates CE-MPC for uncertain nonlinear systems with input constraints and parametric uncertainty. The primary contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, a novel perturbation analysis of the MPC value function is provided, without relying on the common assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the stage cost, better tailoring the popular quadratic cost and having broader applicability to value function approximation, online model learning in MPC, and performance-driven MPC design. Second, the stability and performance analysis of CE-MPC are provided, with a quantification of the suboptimality of CE-MPC compared to the infinite-horizon optimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide valuable insights in how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect stability and performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to linear quadratic control, and a competitive ratio bound is derived, serving as the first competitive-ratio bound for MPC of uncertain linear systems with input constraints and multiplicative uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Prompt-Enabled Large AI Models for CSI Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiajia Guo, Yiming Cui, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool for channel state information (CSI) feedback. While recent research primarily focuses on improving feedback accuracy on a specific dataset through novel architectures, the underlying mechanism of AI-based CSI feedback remains unclear. This study explores the mechanism through analyzing performance across diverse datasets, with findings suggesting that superior feedback performance stems from AI models' strong fitting capabilities and their ability to leverage environmental knowledge. Building on these findings, we propose a prompt-enabled large AI model (LAM) for CSI feedback. The LAM employs powerful transformer blocks and is trained on extensive datasets from various scenarios. To further enhance reconstruction quality, the channel distribution (environmental knowledge) -- represented as the mean of channel magnitude in the angular domain -- is incorporated as a prompt within the decoder. Simulation results confirm that the proposed prompt-enabled LAM significantly improves feedback accuracy and generalization performance while reducing data collection requirements in new scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panagiotis Rousseas, Dimitra Panagou</p>
            <p>This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilana Shapiro, Ruanqianqian Huang, Zachary Novack, Cheng-i Wang, Hao-Wen Dong, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Shlomo Dubnov, Sorin Lerner</p>
            <p>Western music is an innately hierarchical system of interacting levels of structure, from fine-grained melody to high-level form. In order to analyze music compositions holistically and at multiple granularities, we propose a unified, hierarchical meta-representation of musical structure called the structural temporal graph (STG). For a single piece, the STG is a data structure that defines a hierarchy of progressively finer structural musical features and the temporal relationships between them. We use the STG to enable a novel approach for deriving a representative structural summary of a music corpus, which we formalize as a dually NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem extending the Generalized Median Graph problem. Our approach first applies simulated annealing to develop a measure of structural distance between two music pieces rooted in graph isomorphism. Our approach then combines the formal guarantees of SMT solvers with nested simulated annealing over structural distances to produce a structurally sound, representative centroid STG for an entire corpus of STGs from individual pieces. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments verifying that structural distance accurately differentiates between music pieces, and that derived centroids accurately structurally characterize their corpora.</p>

            <h2>DIN-CTS: Low-Complexity Depthwise-Inception Neural Network with Contrastive Training Strategy for Deepfake Speech Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lam Pham, Dat Tran, Phat Lam, Florian Skopik, Alexander Schindler, Silvia Poletti, David Fischinger, Martin Boyer</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a deep neural network approach for deepfake speech detection (DSD) based on a lowcomplexity Depthwise-Inception Network (DIN) trained with a contrastive training strategy (CTS). In this framework, input audio recordings are first transformed into spectrograms using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Linear Filter (LF), which are then used to train the DIN. Once trained, the DIN processes bonafide utterances to extract audio embeddings, which are used to construct a Gaussian distribution representing genuine speech. Deepfake detection is then performed by computing the distance between a test utterance and this distribution to determine whether the utterance is fake or bonafide. To evaluate our proposed systems, we conducted extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset of ASVspoof 2019 LA. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the Depthwise-Inception Network with the contrastive learning strategy in distinguishing between fake and bonafide utterances. We achieved Equal Error Rate (EER), Accuracy (Acc.), F1, AUC scores of 4.6%, 95.4%, 97.3%, and 98.9% respectively using a single, low-complexity DIN with just 1.77 M parameters and 985 M FLOPS on short audio segments (4 seconds). Furthermore, our proposed system outperforms the single-system submissions in the ASVspoof 2019 LA challenge, showcasing its potential for real-time applications.</p>

            <h2>Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Native English: Accuracy and Disfluency Handling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael McGuire</p>
            <p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an essential component of computer assisted language learning (CALL) and computer assisted language testing (CALT) for many years. As this technology continues to develop rapidly, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of current ASR systems for language learning applications. This study assesses five cutting-edge ASR systems' recognition of non-native accented English speech using recordings from the L2-ARCTIC corpus, featuring speakers from six different L1 backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese), in the form of both read and spontaneous speech. The read speech consisted of 2,400 single sentence recordings from 24 speakers, while the spontaneous speech included narrative recordings from 22 speakers. Results showed that for read speech, Whisper and AssemblyAI achieved the best accuracy with mean Match Error Rates (MER) of 0.054 and 0.056 respectively, approaching human-level accuracy. For spontaneous speech, RevAI performed best with a mean MER of 0.063. The study also examined how each system handled disfluencies such as filler words, repetitions, and revisions, finding significant variation in performance across systems and disfluency types. While processing speed varied considerably between systems, longer processing times did not necessarily correlate with better accuracy. By detailing the performance of several of the most recent, widely-available ASR systems on non-native English speech, this study aims to help language instructors and researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of each system and identify which may be suitable for specific use cases.</p>

            <h2>Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu</p>
            <p>Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.</p>

            <h2>Algorithmic analysis of systems with affine input and polynomial state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Clemente</p>
            <p>The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series. Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Schützenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Deep Learning-Based Methods for Irradiance Nowcasting with Sky Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo F. C. Varaschin, Danilo Silva</p>
            <p>To address the high levels of uncertainty associated with photovoltaic energy, an increasing number of studies focusing on short-term solar forecasting have been published. Most of these studies use deep learning-based models to directly forecast a solar irradiance or photovoltaic power value given an input of sky image sequences. Recently, however, advances in generative modeling have led to approaches that divide the forecasting problem into two sub-problems: 1) future event prediction, i.e. generating future sky images; and 2) solar irradiance or photovoltaic power nowcasting, i.e. predicting the concurrent value from a single image. One such approach is the SkyGPT model, where they show that the potential for improvement is much larger for the nowcasting model than for the generative model. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the solar irradiance nowcasting problem and conduct an extensive benchmark of deep learning architectures across the widely-used Folsom, SIRTA and NREL datasets. Moreover, we perform ablation experiments on different training configurations and data processing techniques, including the choice of the target variable used for training and adjustments of the timestamp alignment between images and irradiance measurements. In particular, we draw attention to a potential error associated with the sky image timestamps in the Folsom dataset and a possible fix is discussed. All our results are reported in terms of both the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error and, by leveraging the three datasets, we demonstrate that our findings are consistent across different solar stations.</p>

            <h2>Generalised Harmonic Domain Analysis for Transformer Core Hysteresis Modelling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josh Schipper, Radnya Mukhedkar, Neville Watson, Veerabrahmam Bathini, Jan Meyer</p>
            <p>This work identifies the general approach for linearising any power system component in the harmonic domain, that is with respect to its Fourier series coefficients. This ability enables detailed harmonic analysis, and is key as more power electronic devices inject harmonic currents into the power system to its shared detriment. The general approach requires a time domain model of the component, and is most applicable where a conversion to the frequency domain is impractical prior to linearisation. The outcome is a Norton equivalent current source, which expresses linear coupling between harmonic frequencies with admittance matrices. These are the so-called frequency coupling matrices. The general approach is demonstrated for magnetic hysteresis, where a Preisach model has been developed for this purpose. A new data driven approach is used to fit the test results of a small physical transformer to the Preisach model. Results show an improved accuracy in the frequency coupling matrices over models that only considered magnetic saturation. Maximum improvement is observed in the odd harmonic current to odd harmonic voltage couplings.</p>

            <p>These days, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems have drawn a lot of attention due to the increasing demand for faster data rates. Given the susceptibility of mmWave signals to obstacles and high propagation loss of mmWaves, ensuring line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity is critical for maintaining robust and efficient communication. Furthermore, UAVs have limited power resource and limited capacity in terms of number of users it can serve. Most significantly different users have different delay requirements and they keep moving while interacting with the UAVs. In this paper, first, we have provided an efficient solution for the optimal movement of the UAVs, by taking into account the energy efficiency of the UAVs as well as the mobility and delay priority of the users. Next, we have proposed a greedy solution for the optimal user-UAV assignment. After that, the numerical results show how well the suggested solution performs in comparison to the current benchmarks in terms of delay suffered by the users, number of unserved users, and energy efficiency of the UAVs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bohang Fang, Yue Chen, Changhong Zhao</p>
            <p>The concept of dispatchable region plays a pivotal role in quantifying the capacity of power systems to accommodate renewable generation. In this paper, we extend the previous approximations of the dispatchable regions on direct current (DC), linearized, and nonlinear single-phase alternating current (AC) models to unbalanced three-phase radial (tree) networks and provide improved outer and inner approximations of dispatchable regions. Based on the nonlinear bus injection model (BIM), we relax the non-convex problem that defines the dispatchable region to a solvable semidefinite program (SDP) and derive its strong dual problem (which is also an SDP). Utilizing the special mathematical structure of the dual problem, an SDP-based projection algorithm is developed to construct a convex polytopic outer approximation to the SDP-relaxed dispatchable region. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the exact SDP relaxation by adding the power loss as a penalty term, thereby providing a theoretical guarantee for determining an inner approximation of the dispatchable region. Through numerical simulations, we validate the accuracy of our approximation of the dispatchable region and verify the conditions for exact SDP relaxation.</p>

            <p>To encourage the participation of stochastic distributed energy resources in Nordic ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, has introduced grid codes requiring a minimum 90% reliability for the full availability of reserve capacity bids. This paper addresses the bidding strategy of flexibility aggregators under Energinet's reliability requirement by proposing a chance-constrained optimization model. An analytical solution is developed using ideas from extreme value theory, focusing on the "tail" of the empirical data used for flexibility estimation, capturing extreme events where failures are more likely to occur. The proposed model is applied to an electric vehicle aggregator participating in the Nordic market for frequency containment reserve for disturbances (FCR-D). Our results from a realistic case study show that the proposed analytical solution outperforms a commonly used sample-based approach in terms of out-of-sample constraint violation rate.</p>

            <p>Transformers are essential components for the reliable operation of power grids. The transformer core is constituted by a ferromagnetic material, and accordingly, depending on the magnetization state, the energization of the transformer can lead to high magnetizing inrush currents. Such high amplitudes shorten the life expectancy of a transformer and cause power quality issues in power grids. Various techniques have been proposed to minimize the inrush current; however, the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for this challenge has not been investigated. RL incorporates the ability to learn inrush minimization strategies adjusted to the dynamic transformer operation environment. This study proposes an inrush current minimization framework by combining controlled switching with RL. Depending on the opening angle of the circuit breaker and the remanent fluxes at disconnection, the proposed method learns the optimal closing instant of the circuit breaker. Two RL algorithms have been trained and tested through an equivalent duality-based model of a real 7.4 MVA power transformer. The evaluation of the RL algorithms is carried out with real measurement data and compared with real laboratory inrush currents. The results show that the inrush current is effectively minimized with the proposed framework.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation, current sharing, and Constant Power Load (CPL) stability in DC microgrids (MGs). We describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where DGs, lines, and nonlinear loads (including destabilizing CPLs) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller, designed using dissipativity properties and sector-bounded techniques. For controller synthesis, we formulate a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem that simultaneously addresses voltage regulation, current sharing, and CPL stability guarantees. To support the feasibility of this problem, we propose a sector-bounded approach that characterizes CPL nonlinearities and integrates them into the dissipativity framework through S-procedure techniques. Our approach provides a unified framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies that ensure stability despite the presence of destabilizing CPL effects. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches when handling CPLs.</p>

We show that the CKF has better estimation accuracy than the EKF under some conditions. In order to verify our claim, we have tested the performance various nonlinear estimators on the single machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system under different scenarios. We show that (1) the CKF provides better estimation results than the EKF; (2) the CKF is able to detect different types of cyber attacks reliably which is superior to the EKF.</p>

            <p>Uncalibrated instrument transformers (ITs) can degrade the performance of downstream applications that rely on the voltage and current measurements that ITs provide.

In this paper, we present a statistical framework for solving the simultaneous LPE and IT calibration (SLIC) problem using synchrophasor data. The proposed approach not only avoids the need for a perfect IT by judiciously placing a revenue quality meter (which is an expensive but non-perfect IT), but also accounts for the variations typically occurring in the line parameters. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system as well as actual power system data demonstrate the high accuracy, robustness, and practical utility of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhay Kumar, Dushyant Sharma, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 42.85\%. Furthermore, the proposed method ensures that the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) remain within acceptable limits, significantly improving system resilience in inertia-less power networks.</p>

The thermodynamic behavior of the model is shown to be consistent with real-world conditions, and the comparison of the scenarios concludes that the use of heat pumps for indoor heating in well-insulated buildings has significant economic and sustainability benefits, whereas the use of natural gas-fueled boilers is more cost-effective for buildings with low energy ratings.</p>

            <p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario of interest. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating a parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PBGC) modeling framework with generative methods. To address limitations with gradient flow through the PBGC model, a linearized reformulation is presented, which ensures smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also capturing insights about the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through the utility of generated data when used for downstream compression tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaohuai Liu, Lin Dong, Chao Tian, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Data scaling has revolutionized research fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics control, providing foundation models with remarkable multi-task and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in developing foundation models for power systems, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield multi-task, cross-timescales capabilities that can be deployed in \textit{unseen} operational scenarios. To this end, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling by fine-tuning open-source foundation models using labeled data collected from diverse operational tasks and scenarios. We study how a foundation model's scenario generalization performance evolves with the number of training tasks, scenarios, and demonstrations. Our study involved collecting more than 450k demonstrations and implementing independent tests under a rigorous evaluation framework. Our findings reveal several key insights: First, the generalization performance of a fine-tuned foundation model follows an approximate power-law relationship with the number of demonstrations and scenarios. Second, the fine-tuned model also demonstrates impressive multi-task capabilities, where multi-task training shares similar performance improvements with single-task training as the number of demonstrations increases, without interference among tasks. Lastly, models with small parameter sizes could have strong performance as well. Model performance does not scale significantly with parameter size. These findings underscore the feasibility of developing multi-task foundation models tailored for power systems, demonstrating that while larger datasets and models generally improve performance, extreme scaling is unnecessary to achieve satisfactory outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid FSO and RF Lunar Wireless Power Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baris Donmez, Yanni Jiwan-Mercier, Sebastien Loranger, Gunes Karabulut Kurt</p>
            <p>This study focuses on the feasibility analyses of the hybrid FSO and RF-based WPT system used in the realistic Cislunar environment, which is established by using STK HPOP software in which many external forces are incorporated. In our proposed multi-hop scheme, a solar-powered satellite (SPS) beams the laser power to the low lunar orbit (LLO) satellite in the first hop, then the harvested power is used as a relay power for RF-based WPT to two critical lunar regions, which are lunar south pole (LSP) (0°E,90°S) and Malapert Mountain (0°E,86°S), owing to the multi-point coverage feature of RF systems. The end-to-end system is analyzed for two cases, i) the perfect alignment, and ii) the misalignment fading due to the random mechanical vibrations in the optical inter-satellite link. It is found that the harvested power is maximized when the distance between the SPS and LLO satellite is minimized and it is calculated as 331.94 kW, however, when the random misalignment fading is considered, the mean of the harvested power reduces to 309.49 kW for the same distance. In the next hop, the power harvested by the solar array on the LLO satellite is consumed entirely as the relay power. Identical parabolic antennas are considered during the RF-based WPT system between the LLO satellite and the LSP, which utilizes a full-tracking module, and between the LLO satellite and the Malapert Mountain region, which uses a half-tracking module that executes the tracking on the receiver dish only. In the perfectly aligned hybrid WPT system, 19.80 W and 573.7 mW of maximum harvested powers are yielded at the LSP and Mountain Malapert, respectively. On the other hand, when the misalignment fading in the end-to-end system is considered, the mean of the maximum harvested powers degrades to 18.41 W and 534.4 mW for the former and latter hybrid WPT links.</p>

            <h2>Small-Signal Stability Condition of Inverter-Integrated Power Systems: Closed-Form Expression by Stationary Power Flow Variables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taku Nishino, Yoshiyuki Onishi, Takayuki Ishizaki</p>
            <p>This paper shows that a necessary and sufficient condition for the small-signal stability of an inverter-integrated power system can be expressed in terms of semidefinite matrix inequalities determined only by the synchronous reactance of the components, the susceptance matrix of the transmission network, and the stationary values of the power flow distribution. To derive the stability condition, we consider a class of grid-forming inverters corresponding to a singular perturbation of the synchronous generator. The resulting matrix inequality condition, which has twice as many dimensions as the number of buses and is independent of the dynamics of the connected components, is expressed in terms of each component compensating in a decentralized manner for the loss of frequency synchronization caused by the reactive power consumption in the transmission network. A simple numerical example using a 3-bus power system model shows that a grid-forming inverter load improves power system synchronization, while a grid-following inverter load disrupts it.</p>

            <h2>Problem-Structure-Informed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for Large-Scale Unit Commitment with Limited Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingxian Zhou, Ziqing Zhu, Linghua Zhu, Siqi Bu</p>
            <p>As power systems expand, solving the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP) becomes increasingly challenging due to the dimensional catastrophe, and traditional methods often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose a problem-structure-informed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) framework that fully exploits the quantum advantage under extremely limited quantum resources. Specifically, we leverage the inherent topological structure of power systems to decompose large-scale UCP instances into smaller subproblems, each solvable in parallel by limited number of qubits. This decomposition not only circumvents the current hardware limitations of quantum computing but also achieves higher performance as the graph structure of the power system becomes more sparse. Consequently, our approach can be readily extended to future power systems that are larger and more complex.</p>

            <h2>Agent-Based Analysis of the Impact of Near Real-Time Data and Smart Balancing on the Frequency Stability of Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Lips, Boyana Georgieva, Dominik Schlipf, Hendrik Lens</p>
            <p>Single imbalance pricing provides an incentive to balance responsible parties (BRPs) to intentionally introduce power schedule deviations in order to reduce the control area imbalance and receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. This is called smart balancing or passive balancing and is actively encouraged in, e.g., the Netherlands and Belgium through the publication of near real-time (NRT) data on the control area imbalance by the transmission system operator. It is known that under certain conditions, smart balancing can deteriorate the frequency stability of the power system. This paper examines how the publication of different types of NRT data affects smart balancing and the frequency stability. A Monte-Carlo simulation of a dynamic multi-agent model is performed to analyse the effects of smart balancing with different parameters for the agents and the environment, using historical time series of the power imbalance of the German control block as a basis. It is found that smart balancing can significantly reduce the amount and cost of frequency restoration reserve activation, but leads to a general increase of the frequency variability. Depending on the type of NRT data and agent parameters, the frequency stability margins are also reduced. The negative effects on the frequency stability are stronger when NRT data is published using large bins and with long delays.</p>

            <h2>Insights from Game Theory into the Impact of Smart Balancing on Power System Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Lips, Hendrik Lens</p>
            <p>Smart balancing, also called passive balancing, is the intentional introduction of active power schedule deviations by balance responsible parties (BRPs) to receive a remuneration through the imbalance settlement mechanism. From a system perspective, smart balancing is meant to reduce the need for, and costs of, frequency restoration reserves (FRR), but it can also cause large oscillations in the FRR and jeopardize the system stability. Using a dynamic control area model, this work defines a 2x2 game in which two BRPs can choose to perform smart balancing. We study the impact of time delay, ramp rates, and pricing mechanisms on Nash equilibria and Experience-weighted Attraction (EWA) learning. It is found that, even in an idealized setting, a significant fraction of games in a learned equilibrium results in an overreaction relative to the baseline disturbance, creating an imbalance in the opposite direction. This suggests that the system stability risks are inherent to smart balancing and not a question of implementation. Recommendations are given for implementation choices that can reduce (but not eliminate) the risk of overreactions.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven Modeling of Linearizable Power Flow for Large-scale Grid Topology Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>Effective power flow (PF) modeling critically affects the solution accuracy and computational complexity of large-scale grid optimization problems. Especially for grid optimization involving flexible topology to enhance resilience, obtaining a tractable yet accurate approximation of nonlinear AC-PF is essential. This work puts forth a data-driven approach to obtain piecewise linear (PWL) PF approximation using an innovative neural network (NN) architecture, effectively aligning with the inherent generative structure of AC-PF equations. Accordingly, our proposed generative NN (GenNN) method directly incorporates binary topology variables, efficiently enabling a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation for grid optimization tasks like optimal transmission switching (OTS) and restoration ordering problems (ROP). To attain model scalability for large-scale applications, we develop an area-partitioning-based sparsification approach by using fixed-size areas to attain a linear growth rate of model parameters, as opposed to the quadratic one of existing work. Numerical tests on the IEEE 118-bus and 6716-bus synthetic Texas grid demonstrate that our sparse GenNN achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency, substantially outperforming existing approaches in large-scale PF modeling and topology optimization.</p>

            <h2>Betting vs. Trading: Learning a Linear Decision Policy for Selling Wind Power and Hydrogen</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannick Heiser, Farzaneh Pourahmadi, Jalal Kazempour</p>
            <p>We develop a bidding strategy for a hybrid power plant combining co-located wind turbines and an electrolyzer, constructing a price-quantity bidding curve for the day-ahead electricity market while optimally scheduling hydrogen production. Without risk management, single imbalance pricing leads to an all-or-nothing trading strategy, which we term 'betting'. To address this, we propose a data-driven, pragmatic approach that leverages contextual information to train linear decision policies for both power bidding and hydrogen scheduling. By introducing explicit risk constraints to limit imbalances, we move from the all-or-nothing approach to a 'trading" strategy', where the plant diversifies its power trading decisions. We evaluate the model under three scenarios: when the plant is either conditionally allowed, always allowed, or not allowed to buy power from the grid, which impacts the green certification of the hydrogen produced. Comparing our data-driven strategy with an oracle model that has perfect foresight, we show that the risk-constrained, data-driven approach delivers satisfactory performance.</p>

            <h2>Learning Beamforming Codebooks for Active Sensing with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongze Zhang, Wei Yu</p>
            <p>This paper explores the design of beamforming codebooks for the base station (BS) and for the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in an active sensing scheme for uplink localization, in which the mobile user transmits a sequence of pilots to the BS through reflection at the RISs, and the BS and the RISs are adaptively configured by carefully choosing BS beamforming codeword and RIS codewords from their respective codebooks in a sequential manner to progressively focus onto the user. Most existing codebook designs for RIS are not tailored for active sensing, by which we mean the choice of the next codeword should depend on the measurements made so far, and the sequence of codewords should dynamically focus reflection toward the user. Moreover, most existing codeword selection methods rely on exhaustive search in beam training to identify the codeword with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus incurring substantial pilot overhead as the size of the codebook scales. This paper proposes learning-based approaches for codebook construction and for codeword selection for active sensing. The proposed learning approach aims to locate a target in the service area by recursively selecting a sequence of BS beamforming codewords and RIS codewords from the respective codebooks as more measurements become available without exhaustive beam training. The codebook design and the codeword selection fuse key ideas from the vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn respectively the discrete function space of the codebook and the temporal dependencies between measurements.</p>

            <h2>Nordic perspective on System Integrity Protection Schemes in relation to capacity allocation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Malmer, Arvid Rolander, Emil Hillberg, Olof Samuelsson, Susanne Ackeby, Lars Nordström</p>
            <p>The urgent need to address climate change prompts societies worldwide to adopt carbon neutral energy and electrification. To facilitate this, a range of technologies and policies will be needed. Alternatives to traditional power grid reinforcement, such as grid-enhancing technologies and system automation, are particularly attractive due to their potentially low cost and fast deployment time. One alternative is System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) - automatic and curative remedial actions (RAs) which can boost grid transfer capacities without compromising with reliability since they can act faster than manual control. The use of SIPS however is scattered, with limited coordination between countries, and the full potential of using SIPS for capacity enhancement is not yet realized. The aim of this paper is to provide a case study and comparison of SIPS in the Nordic countries, particularly in relation to capacity allocation. It also seeks to harmonize terminology relating to ancillary services, RAs, and SIPS. Finally, it examines and compares the inclusion of RAs and SIPS in different Capacity Calculation Methodologies (CCMs). In both main EU CCMs - Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) and Flow-Based (FB) - RAs play a pronounced role. The paper is based on a survey and interviews with Nordic stakeholders, along with a literature review and analysis of public data. The results indicate a large variation in SIPS use across the Nordics. Regarding terminology, we suggest that SIPS is a subcategory of RAs which overlaps with ancillary services. Concerning CCMs, NTC is unable to fully represent capacity constraints in meshed AC systems, which in turn hinders systematic capacity enhancement using RAs. FB on the other hand explicitly includes RAs in the capacity domain. A lower bound for the economic value of RAs can be calculated, amounting to 11.5 million EUR in the Nordics in Nov and Dec 2024.</p>

            <h2>RIS-Assisted Passive Localization (RAPL): An Efficient Zero-Overhead Framework Using Conditional Sample Mean</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawei Yao, Yijie Mao, Mingzhe Chen, Ye Hu</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising solution for enhancing localization accuracy. Traditional RIS-based localization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning, and pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy and computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base station (BS) and the RIS. To address these challenges, in this work, we move beyond conventional methods and introduce a novel data-driven, multiple RISs-assisted passive localization approach (RAPL). The proposed method includes two stages, the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the user is estimated by using the conditional sample mean in the first stage, and then the user's position is determined based on the estimated multiple AoD pairs in the second stage. This approach only utilizes the existing communication signals between the user and the BS, relying solely on the measurement of received signal power at each BS antenna for a set of randomly generated phase shifts across all RISs. Moreover, by obviating the need for real-time RIS phase shift optimization or user-to-BS pilot transmissions, the method introduces no additional communication overhead, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-world networks. The proposed scheme is then extended to multi-RIS scenarios considering both parallel and cascaded RIS topologies. Numerical results show that the proposed RAPL improves localization accuracy while significantly reducing energy and signaling overhead compared to conventional methods.</p>

We explore the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISes) mounted on Drone Relay Stations (DRS) to enhance communication reliability. Our study formulates an optimization problem to pinpoint the optimal location and orientation of the DRS, thereby creating an additional propagation path for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. We introduce a heuristic approach that combines trajectory optimization for DRS positioning and a Q-learning scheme for RIS orientation. Our results not only confirm the convergence of the Q-learning algorithm but also demonstrate significant communication improvements achieved by integrating a DRS into V2X networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhang Di, Wang Zeyin, Tang Yanqun, Wu Dongdong, Yuan Muzi</p>
            <p>The secure affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform design is a main concern in high-mobility networks. In this article, we employ the four key parameters in AFDM to design secure waveforms, and afterward we analyze the role of the four parameters to reveal the design guideline. We find that c1 is bounded by the Doppler shifts and preset guard. The parameter c2 exhibits a minimum periodicity of 1, with the effective range [0, 1] rather than any real number. The adjustable parameters c1 and c2 introduce additional degrees of freedom to the AFDM waveform, thereby enhancing the anti-eavesdropping performance. In addition, excessive Lmax that determines the preset guard interval leads to a security-risk interval and poses eavesdropping risks. Therefore, the optimal Lmax equals maximum delay. Numerical simulations verify the accuracy of our analysis.</p>

Furthermore, we demonstrate that, with a sufficiently rich dataset, the model error is bounded by a function of quantization resolution and the MPC tracking error is also ultimately bounded similarly. The theory is validated through numerical experiments conducted on two different linear dynamical systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengbo Wang, Ke Li, Zheng Yan, Zhenyuan Guo, Song Zhu, Guanghui Wen, Shiping Wen</p>
            <p>Safety is of paramount importance in control systems to avoid costly risks and catastrophic damages. The control barrier function (CBF) method, a promising solution for safety-critical control, poses a new challenge of enhancing control performance due to its direct modification of original control design and the introduction of uncalibrated parameters. In this work, we shed light on the crucial role of configurable parameters in the CBF method for performance enhancement with a systematical categorization. Based on that, we propose a novel framework combining the CBF method with Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the safe control performance. Considering feasibility/safety-critical constraints, we develop a safe version of BO using the barrier-based interior method to efficiently search for promising feasible configurable parameters. Furthermore, we provide theoretical criteria of our framework regarding safety and optimality. An essential advantage of our framework lies in that it can work in model-agnostic environments, leaving sufficient flexibility in designing objective and constraint functions. Finally, simulation experiments on swing-up control and high-fidelity adaptive cruise control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p>

            <h2>Bridging the Sim-to-real Gap: A Control Framework for Imitation Learning of Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungtaek Kim, Jonghyup Lee, Kyoungseok Han, Seibum B. Choi</p>
            <p>To address the computational challenges of Model Predictive Control (MPC), recent research has studied on using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained through imitation learning to approximate the MPC. However, this introduces a common issue in learning-based control: the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap. Therefore, Domain Randomization (DR) has been widely used to mitigate this gap by introducing perturbations in the source domain. However, this led to low data collection efficiency and an overly conservative control strategy. This study proposes a new control framework that deals with this issue from a control perspective inspired by Robust Tube MPC. The framework ensures the DNN operates in the same environment as the source domain, handling the sim-to-real gap with great data collection efficiency. Moreover, a parameter governor is introduced to address the DNN's inability to adapt to model parameter variations, enabling the system to satisfy MPC constraints more robustly under changing conditions. The proposed framework was validated through a cart-pole system case study compared by DR baselines, demonstrating that a single MPC-demonstrated trajectory in the source domain was sufficient for controlling the cart-pole in the target domain. Furthermore, the system effectively handled model parameter variations, allowing for a less conservative control.</p>

            <p>Iterative learning control (ILC) improves the performance of a repetitive system by learning from previous trials. ILC can be combined with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to mitigate non-repetitive disturbances, thus improving overall system performance. However, existing approaches either assume perfect model knowledge or fail to actively learn system uncertainties, leading to conservativeness. To address these limitations we propose a binary mixed-integer ILC scheme, combined with a convex MPC scheme, that ensures robust constraint satisfaction, non-increasing nominal cost, and convergence to optimal performance. Our scheme is designed for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to both bounded additive stochastic noise and additive uncertain components. We showcase the benefits of our scheme in simulation.</p>

This is achieved by integrating (a) a Safe Sequencing (SS) policy that ensures merging safety without requiring any knowledge of HDV behavior, and (b) a Model Predictive Control with Control Lyapunov Barrier Functions (MPC-CLBF) framework, which optimizes CAV motion control while mitigating infeasibility and myopic control issues common in the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to provide safety guarantees. Simulation results across various traffic demands, CAV penetration rates, and control parameters demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuling Wang, Peizhe Li, Shanying Zhu, Cailian Chen, Xinping Guan</p>
            <p>Heterogeneous systems consisting of a multiloop wireless control system (WCS) and a mobile agent system (MAS) are ubiquitous in Industrial Internet of Things systems. Within these systems, the positions of mobile agents may lead to shadow fading on the wireless channel that the WCS is controlled over and can significantly compromise its performance, requiring joint coordination between the WCS and MAS. Such coordination introduces different time steps and hybrid state spaces consisting of logical components and continuous components. This paper focuses on the infinite-horizon optimal control of MAS to ensure the performance of WCS while minimizing an average cost for the heterogeneous system subject to safety constraints. A state-dependent fading channel is modeled to capture interference among transmission links, as well as the effects of mobile agents' movements on successful wireless transmission. In order to address the heterogeneous system dynamics, the optimal control problem is formulated as the optimal constrained set stabilization of the MAS by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for the Lyapunov-like performance of WCS with the expected decay rates. Using the semi-tensor product of matrices, a constrained optimal state transition graph is constructed to encode the constrained system dynamics as well as objective function, which further reduces the problem into a minimum-mean cycle problem for the graph. By studying the properties of the graph, the feasibility is proven, and an effective algorithm is proposed for the construction of optimal input sequences. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p>Accurate segmentation of the ventricles from cardiac magnetic resonance images (CMRIs) is crucial for enhancing the diagnosis and analysis of heart conditions. Deep learning-based segmentation methods have recently garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance. However, these segmentation methods are typically good at partitioning regularly shaped organs, such as the left ventricle (LV) and the myocardium (MYO), whereas they perform poorly on irregularly shaped organs, such as the right ventricle (RV). In this study, we argue that this limitation of segmentation models stems from their insufficient generalization ability to address the distribution shift of segmentation targets across slices, cardiac phases, and disease conditions. To overcome this issue, we present a Multi-Disease-Aware Training Strategy (MTS) and restructure the introduced CMRI datasets into multi-disease datasets. Additionally, we propose a specialized data processing technique for preprocessing input images to support the MTS. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we performed control group experiments and cross-validation tests. The experimental results show that (1) network models trained using our proposed strategy achieved superior segmentation performance, particularly in RV segmentation, and (2) these networks exhibited robust performance even when applied to data from unknown diseases.</p>

            <h2>Joint Superimposed Pilot-aided Channel Estimation and Data Detection for FTN Signaling over Doubly-Selective Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simin Keykhosravi, Ebrahim Bedeer</p>
            <p>Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and superimposed pilot (SP) techniques are effective solutions for significantly enhancing the spectral efficiency (SE) in next-generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes an innovative SP-aided channel estimation method for FTN signaling enhancing the SE over doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To avoid complex channel tracking, we utilize a basis expansion model (BEM) to characterize doubly-selective channel variations. We propose a frame structure that superimposes a known periodic pilot sequence onto the information sequence, avoiding SE loss by eliminating the additional overhead of multiplexed pilot (MP). Additionally, we find the optimal FTN signaling SP sequence that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. Expanding on our proposed SP-aided channel estimation method, we propose two detection methods: (1) an SP-aided separate channel estimation and data detection (SCEDD) method performing a single channel estimation followed by iterative data detection via a turbo equalizer, serving as a baseline for evaluating the SP-aided channel estimation method, and (2) an SP-aided joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD) method, which extends the SCEDD by updating the channel estimate in each turbo equalization iteration, becoming our primary focus for its superior performance. At equivalent SE and a higher fading rate on the order of $10^{-3}$, our simulations show that SP-aided SCEDD method outperforms MP-aided techniques in both MSE and BER, while the SP-aided JCEDD method delivers remarkable performance, where reference approaches fail to track rapid channel variations.</p>

Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements.

            <p>This study introduces simple yet effective continuous- and discrete-variable quantum neural network (QNN) models as a transfer-learning approach for forecasting tasks. The CV-QNN features a single quantum layer with two qubits to establish entanglement and utilizes a minimal set of quantum gates, including displacement, rotation, beam splitter, squeezing, and a non-Gaussian cubic-phase gate, with a maximum of eight trainable parameters. A key advantage of this model is its ability to be trained on a single dataset, after which the learned parameters can be transferred to other forecasting problems with little to no fine-tuning. Initially trained on the Kurdistan load demand dataset, the model's frozen parameters are successfully applied to various forecasting tasks, including energy consumption, traffic flow, weather conditions, and cryptocurrency price prediction, demonstrating strong performance. Furthermore, the study introduces a discrete-variable quantum model with an equivalent 2- and 4-wire configuration and presents a performance assessment, showing good but relatively lower effectiveness compared to the continuous-variable model.</p>

            <h2>CTorch: PyTorch-Compatible GPU-Accelerated Auto-Differentiable Projector Toolbox for Computed Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Jiang, Grace J. Grace, J. Webster Stayman</p>
            <p>This work introduces CTorch, a PyTorch-compatible, GPU-accelerated, and auto-differentiable projector toolbox designed to handle various CT geometries with configurable projector algorithms. CTorch provides flexible scanner geometry definition, supporting 2D fan-beam, 3D circular cone-beam, and 3D non-circular cone-beam geometries. Each geometry allows view-specific definitions to accommodate variations during scanning. Both flat- and curved-detector models may be specified to accommodate various clinical devices. CTorch implements four projector algorithms: voxel-driven, ray-driven, distance-driven (DD), and separable footprint (SF), allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency based on their needs. All the projectors are primarily built using CUDA C for GPU acceleration, then compiled as Python-callable functions, and wrapped as PyTorch network module. This design allows direct use of PyTorch tensors, enabling seamless integration into PyTorch's auto-differentiation framework. These features make CTorch an flexible and efficient tool for CT imaging research, with potential applications in accurate CT simulations, efficient iterative reconstruction, and advanced deep-learning-based CT reconstruction.</p>

            <h2>A robust mechanical sensorless control strategy for active rectification of small wind turbines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Prévost, Vincent Léchappé, Romain Delpoux, Xavier Brun</p>
            <p>This article proposes a mechanical sensorless control strategy for the synchronous rectification of small wind turbines equipped with a surface-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). By means of Lyapunov theory, the Global Asymptotic Stability (GAS) of the closed loop system is proven. It allows the use of a classical Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) to remove the mechanical sensor in the control loop despite uncertainties on the resistance and inductance parameters. The analysis of the equilibrium points have made it possible to propose an analytic model of the angular misalignment between the true and the observer rotating frames, responsible for current tracking errors. Experimental tests on a wind turbine emulator show that despite large errors on the the resistance and inductance parameters, the impact on the energy harvest is low, proving that the strategy's performance is robust to high uncertainties.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Net Load Forecasting for High-Penetration RES Grids Utilizing Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixiang Huang, Jianhua Pei, Luocheng Chen, Zhenchang Du, Jinfu Chen, Zirui Peng</p>
            <p>The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES) in modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and accuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erick Silva, Tadeu Freitas, Rehana Yasmin, Ali Shoker, Paulo Esteves-Verissimo</p>
            <p>A notable challenge in Electric Vehicle (EV) charging is the time required to fully charge the battery, which can range from 15 minutes to 2-3 hours. This idle period, however, presents an opportunity to offer time-consuming or data-intensive services such as vehicular software updates. ISO 15118 referred to the concept of Value-Added Services (VAS) in the charging scenario, but it remained underexplored in the literature. Our paper addresses this gap by proposing \acronym, the first EV charger compute architecture that supports secure on-charger universal applications with upstream and downstream communication. The architecture covers the end-to-end hardware/software stack, including standard API for vehicles and IT infrastructure. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of \acronym by employing and evaluating three suggested value-added services: vehicular software updates, security information and event management (SIEM), and secure payments. The results demonstrate significant reductions in bandwidth utilization and latency, as well as high throughput, which supports this novel concept and suggests a promising business model for Electric Vehicle charging station operation.</p>

            <h2>Channel Capacity Saturation Point and Beamforming Acceleration for Near-Field XL-MIMO Multiuser Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Cui, Ki-Hong Park, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
            <p>One of the most important technologies in the fifth generation (5G) and the sixth generation (6G) is massive multiple input multiple outputs (MIMO) or extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO). With the evolving high-frequency technologies in millimeter band or tereHz band, the communication scene is changing into near-field rather than the conventional far-field scenario. In this letter, instead of advertising the XL-MIMO in the near-field, we appeal that a limit should be set on the size of the antenna array, beyond which the channel capacity will not show a significant increase. We show capacity saturation point can be analytically determined. Moreover, we propose a new beamforming algorithm that relieve the heavy computation due to the large antenna size even around the saturation point. Numerical results are provided to validate our analysis and show the performance of our newly proposed beamforming scheme.</p>

            <p>Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4--24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40--880 m propagation distance, encompassing seven Line of Sight (LOS) and 13 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in (CI) free space PL (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The measured NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values (as computed by 3GPP methods) are found to be consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point-data tables with corresponding site-specific environmental information for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to support the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics presented here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morgan Williamson, Aditya Rao, Evan Segura, Bryson Wylie, Matthew Hall</p>
            <p>We investigate the potential of enhancing small (<20 kg) drone endurance by exploiting the high energy density of hydrocarbons using a prototype generator based on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) thermoelectric energy conversion technology. A proof-of-concept prototype was developed to vet design and engineering challenges and to bolster validity of resultant conclusions. The combination of the prototype performance and modeling suggests that endurance augmentation remains a difficult technical challenge with no clear immediate remedy despite many expectant alternatives. Across a sample of representative drones including ground- and air-based, multicopter and fixed wing drones, we report the following: from their current maximum values of 12%, thermoelectric (TE) generator module efficiencies must increase by over two times to achieve endurance parity with lithium batteries for VTOL multicopters. On the other hand, current TE efficiencies can compete with lithium batteries for some low power fixed wing and ground-based drones. Technical contributors for these results include weight of non-energy contributing components, low specific power and the associated tradeoff between specific power and specific energy due to fuel mass fraction, and lastly, low efficiencies.</p>

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences)</p>
            <p>Renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems require rectifiers to supply power to electrolyzers (ELZs). Two main types of rectifiers, insulated-gate bipolar transistor rectifiers (IGBT-Rs) and thyristor rectifiers (TRs), offer distinct tradeoffs. IGBT-Rs provide flexible reactive power control but are costly, whereas TRs are more affordable with lower power loss but consume a large amount of uncontrollable reactive power. A mixed configuration of rectifiers in utility-scale ReP2H systems could achieve an decent tradeoff and increase overall profitability. To explore this potential, this paper proposes an optimal investment portfolio model. First, we model and compare the active and reactive power characteristics of ELZs powered by TRs and IGBT-Rs. Second, we consider the investment of ELZs, rectifiers, and var resources and coordinate the operation of renewables, energy storage, var resources, and the on-off switching and load allocation of multiple ELZs. Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model based on weighted information gap decision theory (W-IGDT) is developed to address the uncertainties of the renewable power and hydrogen price, and we apply the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm to accelerate its solution. Case studies demonstrate that optimal rectifier configurations increase revenue by at most 2.56% compared with using only TRs or IGBT-Rs, as well as those in existing projects. Under the optimal portfolio, reactive power compensation investment is nearly eliminated, with a preferred TR-to-IGBT-R ratio of 3:1.</p>

            <h2>Throughput Maximizing Takeoff Scheduling for eVTOL Vehicles in On-Demand Urban Air Mobility Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Pooladsanj, Ketan Savla, Petros A. Ioannou</p>
            <p>Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by using electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles to provide on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized framework for conflict-free takeoff scheduling of eVTOLs in on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which jointly schedules UAM vehicles for servicing trip requests and rebalancing, subject to safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which the average waiting time transitions from being stable to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy maximizes throughput for sufficiently large fleet size and if the UAM network has a certain symmetry property. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces average passenger waiting time compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</p>

            <p>This letter studies the impact of fluid antenna system (FAS) technology on the performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted multiuser communication networks. Specifically, we consider a scenario where a fixed-position antenna (FPA) base station (BS) serves K FAS-equipped users with the assistance of a UAV acting as an aerial relay. The BS employs rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), while the UAV operates in half-duplex (HD) mode using the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. For this system, we derive a compact analytical expression for the outage probability (OP) and its asymptotic behavior in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, leveraging the multivariate t-distribution. Our results show how deploying FAS at ground users (GUs) in UAV-aided communications improves overall system performance compared to using FPA GUs.</p>

            <p>Vehicle cybersecurity has emerged as a critical concern, driven by the innovation in the automotive industry, e.g., automomous, electric, or connnected vehicles. Current efforts to address these challenges are constrained by the limited computational resources of vehicles and the reliance on connected infrastructures. This motivated the foundation of Vehicle Security Operations Centers (VSOCs) that extend IT-based Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to cover the entire automotive ecosystem, both the in-vehicle and off-vehicle scopes. Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) tools are considered key for impelementing an effective cybersecurity solution. However, existing state-of-the-art solutions depend on infrastructure networks such as 4G, 5G, and WiFi, which often face scalability and congestion issues. To address these limitations, we propose a novel SOAR architecture EVSOAR that leverages the EV charging stations for connectivity and computing to enhance vehicle cybersecurity. Our EV-specific SOAR architecture enables real-time analysis and automated responses to cybersecurity threats closer to the EV, reducing the cellular latency, bandwidth, and interference limitations. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in latency, stability, and scalability through the infrastructure and the capacity to deploy computationally intensive applications, that are otherwise infeasible within the resource constraints of individual vehicles.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Utilization of Distribution System Flexibility for Enhanced TSO-DSO Interoperability: A Novel Machine Learning-Based Optimal Power Flow Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burak Dindar, Can Berk Saner, Hüseyin K. Çakmak, Veit Hagenmeyer</p>
            <p>Due to the transformation of the power system, the effective use of flexibility from the distribution system (DS) is becoming crucial for efficient network management. Leveraging this flexibility requires interoperability among stakeholders, including Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs). However, data privacy concerns among stakeholders present significant challenges for utilizing this flexibility effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based method in which the technical constraints of the DSs are represented by ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data. Using these models, the TSO can solve the optimal power flow (OPF) problem and directly determine the dispatch of flexibility-providing units (FPUs), in our case, distributed generators (DGs), in a single round of communication. To achieve this, we introduce a novel neural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to efficiently represent the feasible region of the DSs, ensuring computational effectiveness. Furthermore, we incorporate various PQ charts rather than idealized ones, demonstrating that the proposed method is adaptable to a wide range of FPU characteristics. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, we benchmark it against the standard AC-OPF on multiple DSs with meshed connections and multiple points of common coupling (PCCs) with varying voltage magnitudes. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method achieves performant results while prioritizing data privacy. Additionally, since this method directly determines the dispatch of FPUs, it eliminates the need for an additional disaggregation step. By representing the DSs technical constraints through ML models trained exclusively on non-sensitive data, the transfer of sensitive information between stakeholders is prevented.</p>

            <p>In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge. Such an operation calls for an energy management system that decides the set points of the primary control layer in the best way possible. This has to fulfill user requirements, minimize costs, and balance local generation with energy storage. Such storage enables building flexibility. This paper presents a novel aging-aware strategy for electrified buildings. The energy management algorithm presented incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between the grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed algorithm can be used to improve grid costs or to protect the batteries (static or electric vehicles). This energy management algorithm can control different cathode chemistries as well as aged and fresh batteries, improving costs with respect to benchmarks for these cases.</p>

            <p>Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</p>

            <p>The integration of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations into 5G and Beyond is essential to achieve truly global connectivity. A distinctive characteristic of LEO mega constellations is that they constitute a global infrastructure with predictable dynamics, which enables the pre-planned allocation of radio resources. However, the different bands that can be used for ground-to-satellite communication are affected differently by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation, which introduces uncertainty on the attenuation of the communication links at high frequencies. Based on this, we present a compelling case for applying integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in heterogeneous and multi-layer LEO satellite constellations over wide areas. Specifically, we propose a sensing-assisted communications framework and frame structure that not only enables the accurate estimation of the atmospheric attenuation in the communication links through sensing but also leverages this information to determine the optimal serving satellites and allocate resources efficiently for downlink communication with users on the ground. The results show that, by dedicating an adequate amount of resources for sensing and solving the association and resource allocation problems jointly, it is feasible to increase the average throughput by 59% and the fairness by 700% when compared to solving these problems separately.</p>

            <p>Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations are expected to transform air transportation while challenging current air traffic management practices. By introducing a novel market-based mechanism, we address the problem of on-demand allocation of capacity-constrained airspace to AAM vehicles with heterogeneous and private valuations. We model airspace and air infrastructure as a collection of contiguous regions with constraints on the number of vehicles that simultaneously enter, stay, or exit each region. Vehicles request access to the airspace with trajectories spanning multiple regions at different times. We use the graph structure of our airspace model to formulate the allocation problem as a path allocation problem on a time-extended graph. To ensure the cost information of AAM vehicles remains private, we introduce a novel mechanism that allocates each vehicle a budget of "air-credits" and anonymously charges prices for traversing the edges of the time-extended graph. We seek to compute a competitive equilibrium that ensures that: (i) capacity constraints are satisfied, (ii) a strictly positive resource price implies that the sector capacity is fully utilized, and (iii) the allocation is integral and optimal for each AAM vehicle given current prices, without requiring access to individual vehicle utilities. However, a competitive equilibrium with integral allocations may not always exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence and computation of a fractional-competitive equilibrium, where allocations can be fractional. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a distributed, iterative, two-step algorithm that: 1) computes a fractional competitive equilibrium, and 2) derives an integral allocation from this equilibrium. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in allocating trajectories for two emerging urban air mobility services: drone delivery and air taxis.</p>

            <p>The uncertainty in distribution grid planning is driven by the unpredictable spatial and temporal patterns in adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. This complexity, stemming from interactions among EVs, PV systems, customer behavior, and weather conditions, calls for a scalable framework to capture a full range of possible scenarios and analyze grid responses to factor in compound uncertainty. Although this process is challenging for many utilities today, the need to model numerous grid parameters as random variables and evaluate the impact on the system from many different perspectives will become increasingly essential to facilitate more strategic and well-informed planning investments. We present a scalable, stochastic-aware distribution system planning application that addresses these uncertainties by capturing spatial and temporal variability through a Markov model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations leveraging modular cloud-based architecture. The results demonstrate that 15,000 power flow scenarios generated from the Markov model are completed on the modified IEEE 123-bus test feeder, with each simulation representing an 8,760-hour time series run, all in under an hour. The grid impact extracted from this huge volume of simulated data provides insights into the spatial and temporal effects of adopted technology, highlighting that planning solely for average conditions is inadequate, while worst-case scenario planning may lead to prohibitive expenses.</p>

            <p>Differential privacy (DP) provides a principled approach to synthesizing data (e.g., loads) from real-world power systems while limiting the exposure of sensitive information. However, adversaries may exploit synthetic data to calibrate cyberattacks on the source grids. To control these risks, we propose new DP algorithms for synthesizing data that provide the source grids with both cyber resilience and privacy guarantees. The algorithms incorporate both normal operation and attack optimization models to balance the fidelity of synthesized data and cyber resilience. The resulting post-processing optimization is reformulated as a robust optimization problem, which is compatible with the exponential mechanism of DP to moderate its computational burden.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary</p>
            <p>Energy storage is needed to match renewable generation to industrial loads in energy parks. However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is currently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets, energy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in storage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during initial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design adaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the cost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly. This raises the question, "Is it worth it?" This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy park designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty reduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the Value of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and storage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal near Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and capital cost. Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce total costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology choice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater than the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies in the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality is not worthwhile. These results are robust to the level of uncertainty reduction in storage performance, and the risk aversion of the system designer.</p>

We show that the presented method, which builds further on work done in [1], effectively allows to control multiple ADNs in a distributed way to ensure they achieve a common objective without revealing information on their DERs capabilities or grid model. This experimental validation is carried out using demonstrators at the DESL of EPFL and the NEST site at Empa, both in Switzerland. The coordination of the systems to share the flexibility of their controllable assets is demonstrated through a set of 24h experiments. Finally, the limitations of the method are discussed and future extensions proposed.</p>

            <h2>Assessment of Cyberattack Detection-Isolation Algorithm for CAV Platoons Using SUMO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy</p>
            <p>A Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) platoon in an evolving real-world driving environment relies strongly on accurate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for its safe and efficient operation. However, a cyberattack on this communication network can corrupt the appropriate control actions, tamper with system measurement, and drive the platoon to unsafe or undesired conditions. As a first step toward practicable resilience against such V2V-V2I attacks, in this paper, we implemented a unified V2V-V2I cyberattack detection scheme and a V2I isolation scheme for a CAV platoon under changing driving conditions in Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The implemented algorithm utilizes vehicle-specific residual generators that are designed based on analytical disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity performance constraints. Our case studies include two driving scenarios where highway driving is simulated using the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) data and urban driving follows the benchmark EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS). The results validate the applicability of the algorithm to ensure CAV cybersecurity and demonstrate the promising potential for practical test-bed implementation in the future.</p>

            <h2>Towards Connected Smart Work Zones: Advancing Work Zone Management through Improved Connectivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Nour, Mohamed H. Zaki, Mohamed Abdel-Aty</p>
            <p>Work zones play a key role in road and highway maintenance but can lead to significant risks to both drivers and workers. Smart Work Zones (SWZs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering decision-makers real-time insights into the status of the work zone. By utilizing work zone barrels equipped with sensors and communication nodes, SWZs facilitate collecting and transmitting critical data, including location, traffic density, flow patterns, and worker proximity alerts. In collaboration with the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), this study addresses work zone barrel connectivity requirements while considering a cost-effective, low-power, and low-maintenance solution. While the broader project aimed to create a complete SWZ system for the localization of work zone barrels, this paper proposes a novel relay node selection algorithm integrated with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to enhance network performance. The proposed algorithm enhances the communication network performance by selecting specific nodes as relay points, avoiding message flooding in the network. It demonstrates an improvement in message delivery rates, achieving up to a 40% increase over existing methods while ensuring balanced load distribution among nodes. Moreover, it maintains an 80% message delivery rate while minimizing power consumption, outperforming other approaches. This improvement in communication efficiency is critical, as it ensures the accurate transmission and delivery of vital work zone data, allowing for faster and more informed decisions to enhance work zone safety and management.</p>

            <h2>Sensing-Based Beamformed Resource Allocation in Standalone Millimeter-Wave Vehicular Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Traspadini, Anay Ajit Deshpande, Marco Giordani, Chinmay Mahabal, Takayuki Shimizu, Michele Zorzi</p>
            <p>In 3GPP New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), the new standard for next-generation vehicular networks, vehicles can autonomously select sidelink resources for data transmission, which permits network operations without cellular coverage. However, standalone resource allocation is uncoordinated, and is complicated by the high mobility of the nodes that may introduce unforeseen channel collisions (e.g., when a transmitting vehicle changes path) or free up resources (e.g., when a vehicle moves outside of the communication area). Moreover, unscheduled resource allocation is prone to the hidden node and exposed node problems, which are particularly critical considering directional transmissions. In this paper, we implement and demonstrate a new channel access scheme for NR V2X in Frequency Range 2 (FR2), i.e., at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, based on directional and beamformed transmissions along with Sidelink Control Information (SCI) to select resources for transmission. We prove via simulation that this approach can reduce the probability of collision for resource allocation, compared to a baseline solution that does not configure SCI transmissions.</p>

            <h2>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boxun Liu, Shijian Gao, Xuanyu Liu, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang</p>
            <p>Channel prediction permits to acquire channel state information (CSI) without signaling overhead. However, almost all existing channel prediction methods necessitate the deployment of a dedicated model to accommodate a specific configuration. Leveraging the powerful modeling and multi-task learning capabilities of foundation models, we propose the first space-time-frequency (STF) wireless foundation model (WiFo) to address time-frequency channel prediction tasks in a one-for-all manner. Specifically, WiFo is initially pre-trained over massive and extensive diverse CSI datasets. Then, the model will be instantly used for channel prediction under various CSI configurations without any fine-tuning. We propose a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based network structure for WiFo to handle heterogeneous STF CSI data, and design several mask reconstruction tasks for self-supervised pre-training to capture the inherent 3D variations of CSI. To fully unleash its predictive power, we build a large-scale heterogeneous simulated CSI dataset consisting of 160K CSI samples for pre-training. Simulations validate its superior unified learning performance across multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot generalization performance via comparisons with other full-shot baselines.</p>

            <h2>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonçalo Hora de Carvalho</p>
            <p>Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Noever, Forrest McKee</p>
            <p>The paper presents a novel technique for encoding dual messages within standard Quick Response (QR) codes through precise half-pixel module splitting. This work challenges fundamental assumptions about deterministic decoding in the ISO/IEC 18004:2015 standard while maintaining complete compatibility with existing QR infrastructure. The proposed two-dimensional barcode attack enables angle-dependent message selection while maintaining compatibility with unmodified QR readers and the 100 million US mobile users who use their phone's built-in scanners. Unlike previous approaches that rely on nested codes, watermarking, or error correction exploitation, our method achieves true one-to-many mapping by manipulating the physical sampling process built into the QR standard. By preserving critical function patterns while bifurcating data modules, we create automated codes that produce different but valid readings based on camera viewing angle. Experimental results demonstrate successful implementation across multiple use cases, including simple message text pairs, complex URLs (this http URL), and security test patterns for malware and spam detectors (EICAR/GTUBE). Our technique achieves reliable dual-message decoding using standard QR readers at module scales of 9-11 pixels, with successful angle-dependent reading demonstrated across vertical, horizontal, and diagonal orientations. The method's success suggests potential applications beyond QR code phishing ('quishing') including two-factor authentication, anti-counterfeiting, and information density optimization. The half-pixel technique may offer future avenues for similar implementations in other 2D barcode formats such as Data Matrix and Aztec Code.</p>

            <p>With the Internet of Things (IoT) fostering seamless device-to-human and device-to-device interactions, the domain of intelligent lighting systems have evolved beyond simple occupancy and daylight sensing towards autonomous monitoring and control of power consumption and illuminance levels. To this regard, this paper proposes a new do-it-yourself (DIY) IoT-based method of smart lighting system featuring an illuminance control algorithm. The design involves the integration of occupancy and presence sensors alongside a communication module, to enable real-time wireless interaction and remote monitoring of the system parameters from any location through an end-user application. A constrained optimization problem was formulated to determine the optimal dimming vector for achieving target illuminance at minimal power consumption. The simplex algorithm was used to solve this problem, and the system's performance was validated through both MATLAB simulations and real-world prototype testing in an indoor office environment. The obtained experimental results demonstrate substantial power savings across multiple user occupancy scenarios, achieving reductions of approx. 80%, 48%, and 26% for one, two, and four user settings, respectively, in comparison to traditional basic lighting installation systems.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Learning-based Offshore Wind Power Prediction Models with Various Feature Combinations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linhan Fang, Fan Jiang, Ann Mary Toms, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Accurate wind speed prediction is crucial for designing and selecting sites for offshore wind farms. This paper investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting offshore wind power for a site near the Gulf of Mexico by analyzing meteorological data. After collecting and preprocessing meteorological data, nine different input feature combinations were designed to assess their impact on wind power predictions at multiple heights. The results show that using wind speed as the output feature improves prediction accuracy by approximately 10% compared to using wind power as the output. In addition, the improvement of multi-feature input compared with single-feature input is not obvious mainly due to the poor correlation among key features and limited generalization ability of models. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate output features and highlight considerations for using machine learning in wind power forecasting, offering insights that could guide future wind power prediction models and conversion techniques.</p>

In this paper, we present comparative evaluation results of an extensive set of machine learning models for the classification of power quality events, based on their root causes. After extensive experiments using different machine learning libraries, it is observed that the best performing learning models turn out to be Cubic SVM and XGBoost. During error analysis, it is observed that the main source of performance degradation for both models is the classification of ABC faults as ABCG faults, or vice versa. Ultimately, the models achieving the best results will be integrated into the event classification module of a large-scale power quality and grid monitoring system for the Turkish electricity transmission system.</p>

            <h2>An Assessment of the UK Government Clean Energy Strategy for the Year 2030</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony D. Stephens, David R. Walwyn</p>
            <p>In 2024, the UK Government made two striking announcements on its plans to decarbonise the energy system; it pledged GBP22 billion to establish carbon capture and storage hubs on Teesside and Merseyside and released the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. This paper questions the validity of both plans, arguing that they do not take adequate account of the consequences of the highly variable nature of wind and solar generations. Using dynamic models of future UK electricity systems which are designed to take account of these variabilities, it is shown that the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan overestimates the ability of wind and solar generations to decarbonise the electricity system as they increase in size relative to the demand of the electricity system. More importantly, the dynamic models show that most of the achievable decarbonization is the result of increasing wind generation from the current level of around 10 GW to around 20 GW. Increasing wind generation to only 20 GW, rather than to 30 GW as proposed in the Action Plan, should halve the proposed cost, a saving of perhaps GBP 120 billion, with little disbenefit in terms of reduced decarbonization. Furthermore, the dynamic modelling shows that UK gas storage capacity of 7.5 winter days looks hopeless inadequate in comparison with the storage capacities deemed necessary by its continental neighbors. Concern is expressed that a consequence of the Climate Change Act of 2008 requiring the UK to meet arbitrary decarbonization targets is leading government advisors to propose several unproven and therefore highly risky technological solutions.</p>

            <p>The energy sector's digital transformation brings mutually dependent communication and energy infrastructure, tightening the relationship between the physical and the digital world. Digital twins (DT) are the key concept for this. This paper initially discusses the evolution of the DT concept across various engineering applications before narrowing its focus to the power systems domain. By reviewing different definitions and applications, the authors present a new definition of DTs specifically tailored to power systems. Based on the proposed definition and extensive deliberations and consultations with distribution system operators, energy traders, and municipalities, the authors introduce a vision of a standard DT ecosystem architecture that offers services beyond real-time updates and can seamlessly integrate with existing transmission and distribution system operators' processes while reconciling with concepts such as microgrids and local energy communities based on a system-of-systems view. The authors also discuss their vision related to the integration of power system DTs into various phases of the system's life cycle, such as long-term planning, emphasising challenges that remain to be addressed, such as managing measurement and model errors, and uncertainty propagation. Finally, the authors present their vision of how artificial intelligence and machine learning can enhance several power systems DT modules established in the proposed architecture.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is envisioned as a key feature in future wireless communications networks. Its integration with massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques promises to leverage substantial spatial beamforming gains for both functionalities. In this work, we consider a massive MIMO-ISAC system employing a uniform planar array with zero-forcing and maximum-ratio downlink transmission schemes combined with monostatic radar-type sensing. Our focus lies on deriving closed-form expressions for the achievable communications rate and the Cramér--Rao lower bound (CRLB), which serve as performance metrics for communications and sensing operations, respectively. The expressions enable us to investigate important operational characteristics of massive MIMO-ISAC, including the mutual effects of communications and sensing as well as the advantages stemming from using a very large antenna array for each functionality. Furthermore, we devise a power allocation strategy based on successive convex approximation to maximize the communications rate while guaranteeing the CRLB constraints and transmit power budget. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed power allocation approach.</p>

Technological advancements in energy density and battery pack capacities are poised to take electric vehicle ranges over 1000 km from a single charge. This study also examines developments in artificial intelligence-improved battery management systems, enhanced safety, mechanical integrity, reliability, diagnostics, and practical considerations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusheng Dai, Chenxi Wang, Chang Li, Chen Wang, Jun Du, Kewei Li, Ruoyu Wang, Jiefeng Ma, Lei Sun, Jianqing Gao</p>
            <p>This paper introduces Swap Forward (SaFa), a modality-agnostic and efficient method to generate seamless and coherence long spectrum and panorama through latent swap joint diffusion across multi-views. We first investigate the spectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing joint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent representation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure arises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the spectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this issue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap applied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise differentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively enhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore, to improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we introduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator that provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview diffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view similarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms existing joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio generation using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length adaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable performance with 2 $\sim$ 20 $\times$ faster speed and greater model generalizability.

            <p>Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E Harshith Kumar Yadav, Rahul Narava, Anshika, Shashi Shekher Jha</p>
            <p>Managing equal charge levels in active cell balancing while charging a Li-ion battery is challenging. An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.</p>

            <p>The proper disposal and repurposing of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries are critical for maximizing their environmental benefits. This study introduces a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework designed to optimize the battery discharging process during pre-treatment, ensuring both efficiency and safety. The proposed method explicitly incorporates temperature constraints to prevent overheating and potential hazards. By leveraging a control-oriented equivalent circuit model integrated with thermal dynamics, the MPC algorithm dynamically adjusts the discharging profile to maintain safe operating temperatures. Additionally, the robust controller is designed to account for model mismatches between the nonlinear battery dynamics and the linearized model, ensuring reliable performance under varying conditions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through simulations comparing the robust MPC method with conventional discharging strategies, including constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) and constant current-constant temperature (CC-CT) methods. Results indicate that the robust MPC framework significantly reduces discharging time while adhering to safety constraints, offering a promising solution for the recycling and second-life applications of lithium-ion batteries.</p>

            <p>Virtual energy stations (VESs) work as retailers to provide electricity and natural gas sale services for integrated energy systems (IESs), and guide IESs energy consumption behaviors to tackle the varying market prices via integrated demand response (IDR). However, IES customers are risk averse and show low enthusiasm in responding to the IDR incentive signals. To address this problem, exergy is utilized to unify different energies and allowed to be virtually stored and withdrawn for arbitrage by IESs. The whole incentive mechanism operating process is innovatively characterized by a virtual exergy battery. Peer to peer (P2P) exergy trading based on shared exergy storage is also developed to reduce the energy cost of IESs without any extra transmission fee. In this way, IES can reduce the economic loss risk caused by the market price fluctuation via the different time (time dimension), multiple energy conversion (energy dimension), and P2P exergy trading (space dimension) arbitrage. Moreover, the optimal scheduling of VES and IESs is modeled by a bilevel optimization model. The consensus based alternating direction method of multipliers (CADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this problem in a distributed way. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism and show that the shared exergy storage can enhance the benefits of different type IESs by 18.96%, 3.49%, and 3.15 %, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Sima, Mingyu Yan, Jianfeng Wen, Wensheng Luo, Mariusz Malinowski</p>
            <p>During the scheduling process, the traffic network operator (TNO) and the distribution network operator (DNO) act noncooperatively. Under the TNO management, the distribution of charging loads may exacerbate the local supply demand imbalance in the power distribution network (PDN), which negatively impacts the economic operation of the PDN. This paper proposes a profitsharing mechanism based on the principle of incentive compatibility for coordinating the traffic network (TN) and the PDN to minimize the operation cost of PDN. Under this mechanism, the scheduling process of the power traffic system is divided into two stages. At the prescheduling stage, the TNO allocates traffic flow and charging loads without considering the operation of the PDN, after which the DNO schedules and obtains the original cost. At the rescheduling stage, the DNO shares part of benefits of the optimal operation to the TNO to redispatch the EV charging to obtain a more effective charging plan, thus minimize the overall cost of PDN. Then, a bilevel model is developed to simulate the operation of the power traffic system with the proposed sharing scheme and identify the best sharing ratio. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the PDN can achieve the minimum total cost and simultaneously the TN can also benefit from the proposed profit sharing mechanism.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of renewables is replacing traditional synchronous generation in modern power systems with low-inertia asynchronous converter-interfaced generators (CIGs). This penetration threatens the dynamic stability of the modern power system. To assess the latter, we resort to the critical clearing time (CCT) as a stability index, which is typically computed through a large number of time-domain simulations. This is especially true for CIG-embedded power systems, where the complexity of the model is further increased. To alleviate the computing burden, we developed a trajectory sensitivity-based method for assessing the CCT in power systems with synchronous and asynchronous generators.

            <h2>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaqi Wu, Jingyi Yuan, Yang Weng, Guangwen Wang</p>
            <p>Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network (NN) parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of NN, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.</p>

            <h2>Robust Co-Optimization of Distribution Network Hardening and Mobile Resource Scheduling with Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donglai Ma, Xiaoyu Cao, Bo Zeng, Chen Chen, Qiaozhu Zhai, Qing-Shan Jia, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>This paper studies the robust co-planning of proactive network hardening and mobile hydrogen energy resources (MHERs) scheduling, which is to enhance the resilience of power distribution network (PDN) against the disastrous events. A decision-dependent robust optimization model is formulated with min-max resilience constraint and discrete recourse structure, which helps achieve the load survivability target considering endogenous uncertainties. Different from the traditional model with a fixed uncertainty set, we adopt a dynamic representation that explicitly captures the endogenous uncertainties of network contingency as well as the available hydrogen storage levels of MHERs, which induces a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set. Also, the multi-period adaptive routing and energy scheduling of MHERs are modeled as a mixed-integer recourse problem for further decreasing the resilience cost. Then, a nested parametric column-and-constraint generation (N-PC&CG) algorithm is customized and developed to solve this challenging formulation. By leveraging the structural property of the DDU set as well as the combination of discrete recourse decisions and the corresponding extreme points, we derive a strengthened solution scheme with nontrivial enhancement strategies to realize efficient and exact computation. Numerical results on 14-bus test system and 56-bus real-world distribution network demonstrate the resilience benefits and economical feasibility of the proposed method under different damage severity levels. Moreover, the enhanced N-PC&CG shows a superior solution capability to support prompt decisions for resilient planning with DDU models.</p>

            <h2>Robust Full-Space Physical Layer Security for STAR-RIS-Aided Wireless Networks: Eavesdropper with Uncertain Location and Channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Xiao, Xiaoyan Hu, Ang Li, Wenjie Wang, Kun Yang</p>
            <p>A robust full-space physical layer security (PLS) transmission scheme is proposed in this paper considering the full-space wiretapping challenge of wireless networks supported by simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Different from the existing schemes, the proposed PLS scheme takes account of the uncertainty on the eavesdropper's position within the 360$^\circ$ service area offered by the STAR-RIS. Specifically, the large system analytical method is utilized to derive the asymptotic expression of the average security rate achieved by the security user, considering that the base station (BS) only has the statistical information of the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) and the uncertainty of its location. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PLS scheme, we first formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the weighted sum rate of the security user and the public user. This optimization is conducted under the power allocation constraint, and some practical limitations for STAR-RIS implementation, through jointly designing the active and passive beamforming variables. A novel iterative algorithm based on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and cross-entropy optimization (CEO) methods is proposed to effectively address the established non-convex optimization problem with discrete variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed robust PLS scheme can effectively mitigate the information leakage across the entire coverage area of the STAR-RIS-assisted system, leading to superior performance gain when compared to benchmark schemes encompassing traditional RIS-aided scheme.</p>

            <p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</p>

            <h2>Degradation-Aware Microgrid Optimal Planning: Integrating Dynamic Energy Efficiencies and Second-Life Battery Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hassan Zahid Butt, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Traditional microgrid planning often overlooks PV and BESS degradation or relies on complex, downscaled models, leading to unreliable, costly and suboptimal investment decisions. This paper presents a degradation-based investment optimization (DBIO) methodology for long-term microgrid planning. The model optimally sizes and schedules PV, BESS, and controllable distributed energy resources, while considering technical, financial, and degradation characteristics. We first developed a cumulative multi-year optimization model as a benchmark, excluding BESS efficiency fade and capacity degradation that would be captured in the next step, to ensure convergence. Subsequently, a yearly validation model was iteratively solved for each year in the planning horizon, updating energy efficiencies of PV and BESS, along with BESS capacity, based on annual degradation, ensuring the reliability of initial solution. An iterative refinement process further adjusts BESS capacity to eliminate load shedding while minimizing costs. Sensitivity analyses on PV efficiency degradation rates, second-life battery (SLB) capital cost, and grid tariffs further explore their economic implications. Results show that degradation significantly impacts resource allocation, with ignored degradation risking reliability, potential load shedding, and blackout costs, while SLBs provide cost-saving opportunities. The DBIO framework offers a computationally efficient and scalable solution for microgrid planning, with broader applications in grid-scale asset management.</p>

            <h2>A Weighted Predict-and-Optimize Framework for Power System Operation Considering Varying Impacts of Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingrui Zhuang, Lin Cheng, Can Wan, Rui Xie, Ning Qi, Yue Chen</p>
            <p>Integrating prediction and optimization enhances decision-making quality by yielding near optimal solutions. Given that prediction errors associated with multiple uncertainties have varying impacts on downstream decision-making, improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Inspired by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative importance of each uncertainty for specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of weighted predictions for downstream optimization as compared to perfect predictions. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, WPO framework enables adaptive uncertainty impact assessment and integrated learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we construct a surrogate model to establish the mapping between weights and PDPL, where multi-task learning and enhanced graph convolutional networks are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms traditional methods by achieving a much smaller PDPL within acceptable computational time.</p>

The analysis leverages data from a low-voltage wide area monitoring system (WAMS) and publicly available historical generation records from the Brazilian System Operator. A methodology is introduced to extract local frequency fluctuations across regions using a variational mode decomposition (VMD) approach. The findings reveal a continuous degradation in the system-wide frequency and local frequency variations, underscoring the need for enhanced regional monitoring and evaluation metrics to maintain frequency stability in large-scale interconnected systems.</p>

            <h2>Inverter Control with Time-Varying and Nonconvex State and Input Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixiao Ma, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>The growing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into modern power systems poses significant challenges for maintaining reliable operation under dynamic and constrained conditions. This paper focuses on the power tracking problem for grid-connected IBRs, addressing the complexities introduced by voltage and power factor constraints. Voltage constraints, being time-varying and nonlinear input constraints, often conflict with power factor constraints, which are state constraints. These conflicts, coupled with stability requirements, add substantial complexity to control design. To overcome these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient static state-feedback controller that guarantees stability and satisfies operational constraints. The concept of achievability is introduced to evaluate whether power setpoints can be accurately tracked while adhering to all constraints. Using a parameterization framework and the S-lemma, we develop criteria to assess and maximize the continuous achievable region for IBR operation. This framework allows system operators to ensure safety and stability by precomputing a finite set of control gains, significantly reducing online computational requirements. The proposed approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling time-varying grid disturbances and achieving reliable control performance.</p>

A multi-objective optimization framework is employed, integrating HOMER Pro for system sizing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL).

The proposed microgrid configuration achieves high reliability, satisfying 100% of the load, even under adverse weather conditions. The proposed framework attains an efficiency of 91.99% while maintaining a carbon footprint of 302,747 kg/year, which is approximately 95% lower than that of the grid system. The economic analysis indicates a net present cost (NPC) of $4.83M with a competitive LCOE of $0.208/kWh.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyang Huang, Min Xiong, Yang Liu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>As inverter-based resources (IBRs) penetrate power systems, the dynamics become more complex, exhibiting multiple timescales, including electromagnetic transient (EMT) dynamics of power electronic controllers and electromechanical dynamics of synchronous generators. Consequently, the power system model becomes highly stiff, posing a challenge for efficient simulation using existing methods that focus on dynamics within a single timescale. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiscale Method for highly efficient multi-timescale simulation of a power system represented by its EMT model. The new method alternates between the microscopic EMT model of the system and an automatically reduced macroscopic model, varying the step size accordingly to achieve significant acceleration while maintaining accuracy in both fast and slow dynamics of interests. It also incorporates a semi-analytical solution method to enable a more adaptive variable-step mechanism. The new simulation method is illustrated using a two-area system and is then tested on a detailed EMT model of the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Deadlock Avoidance for Decentralized Multi-agent Systems via CBF-inspired Risk Measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanze Zhang, Yiwei Lyu, Siwon Jo, Yupeng Yang, Wenhao Luo</p>
            <p>Decentralized safe control plays an important role in multi-agent systems given the scalability and robustness without reliance on a central authority. However, without an explicit global coordinator, the decentralized control methods are often prone to deadlock -- a state where the system reaches equilibrium, causing the robots to stall. In this paper, we propose a generalized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution and ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the agents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can detect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is achieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to prevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium. To avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original task-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk measurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to adaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the agents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or deactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments.</p>

            <p>Dynamic simulation plays a crucial role in power system transient stability analysis, but traditional numerical integration-based methods are time-consuming due to the small time step sizes. Other semi-analytical solution methods, such as the Differential Transformation method, often struggle to select proper orders and steps, leading to slow performance and numerical instability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive dynamic simulation approach for power system transient stability analysis. The approach adds feedback control and optimization to selecting the step and order, utilizing the Differential Transformation method and a proportional-integral control strategy to control truncation errors. Order selection is formulated as an optimization problem resulting in a variable-step-optimal-order method that achieves significantly larger time step sizes without violating numerical stability. It is applied to three systems: the IEEE 9-bus, 3-generator system, IEEE 39-bus, 10-generator system, and a Polish 2383-bus, 327-generator system, promising computational efficiency and numerical robustness for large-scale power system is demonstrated in comprehensive case studies.</p>

            <p>In studies on complex network systems using graph theory, eigen-analysis is typically performed on an undirected graph model of the network. However, when analyzing cascading failures in a power system, the interactions among failures suggest the need for a directed graph beyond the topology of the power system to model directions of failure propagation. To accurately quantify failure interactions for effective mitigation strategies, this paper proposes a stochastic interaction graph model and associated eigen-analysis. Different types of modes on failure propagations are defined and characterized by the eigenvalues of a stochastic interaction matrix, whose absolute values are unity, zero, or in between. Finding and interpreting these modes helps identify the probable patterns of failure propagation, either local or widespread, and the participating components based on eigenvectors. Then, by lowering the failure probabilities of critical components highly participating in a mode of widespread failures, cascading can be mitigated. The validity of the proposed stochastic interaction graph model, eigen-analysis and the resulting mitigation strategies is demonstrated using simulated cascading failure data on an NPCC 140-bus system.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.</p>

Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of jointly optimizing physical interactions, energy management, and trajectory, highlighting their strong interdependence. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals characteristic strategic behaviors observed in real-world racing.

Using a dataset comprising outage records, meteorological indicators, and vegetation metrics, this paper develops a logistic regression model that outperformed several alternatives, effectively identifying risk factors in highly imbalanced data. Key features impacting outages include wind speed, vegetation density, quantified as the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and snow type, with wet snow and autumn conditions exhibiting the strongest positive effects. The analysis also shows complex interactions, such as the combined effect of wind speed and EVI, suggesting that vegetation density can moderate the impact of high winds on outages. Simulation case studies, based on a test dataset of 618 samples, demonstrated that the model achieved an 80\% match rate with real-world data within an error tolerance of \(\pm 0.05\), showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model while highlighting its potential to inform preventive strategies for mitigating outage risks in power distribution networks under high-risk environmental conditions.

            <h2>Context-aware Constrained Reinforcement Learning Based Energy-Efficient Power Scheduling for Non-stationary XR Data Traffic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kexuan Wang, An Liu</p>
            <p>In XR downlink transmission, energy-efficient power scheduling (EEPS) is essential for conserving power resource while delivering large data packets within hard-latency constraints. Traditional constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) algorithms show promise in EEPS but still struggle with non-convex stochastic constraints, non-stationary data traffic, and sparse delayed packet dropout feedback (rewards) in XR. To overcome these challenges, this paper models the EEPS in XR as a dynamic parameter-constrained Markov decision process (DP-CMDP) with a varying transition function linked to the non-stationary data traffic and solves it by a proposed context-aware constrained reinforcement learning (CACRL) algorithm, which consists of a context inference (CI) module and a CRL module. The CI module trains an encoder and multiple potential networks to characterize the current transition function and reshape the packet dropout rewards according to the context, transforming the original DP-CMDP into a general CMDP with immediate dense rewards. The CRL module employs a policy network to make EEPS decisions under this CMDP and optimizes the policy using a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) method, which is better suited for non-convex stochastic constraints. Finally, theoretical analyses provide deep insights into the CADAC algorithm, while extensive simulations demonstrate that it outperforms advanced baselines in both power conservation and satisfying packet dropout constraints.</p>

            <h2>Optimal ISAC Beamforming Structure and Efficient Algorithms for Sum Rate and CRLB Balancing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyu Fang, Mengyuan Ma, Markku Juntti, Nir Shlezinger, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Nhan Thanh Nguyen</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm to unify wireless communications and radar sensing, enabling efficient spectrum and hardware utilization. A core challenge with realizing the gains of ISAC stems from the unique challenges of dual purpose beamforming design due to the highly non-convex nature of key performance metrics such as sum rate for communications and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for sensing. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity structured approach to ISAC beamforming optimization to simultaneously enhance spectral efficiency and estimation accuracy. Specifically, we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm which transforms the original non-convex problem into a sequence of convex subproblems ensuring convergence to a locally optimal solution. Furthermore, leveraging the proposed SCA framework and the Lagrange duality, we derive the optimal beamforming structure for CRLB optimization in ISAC systems. Our findings characterize the reduction in radar streams one can employ without affecting performance. This enables a dimensionality reduction that enhances computational efficiency. Numerical simulations validate that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance to the considered benchmarks while requiring much lower computational costs.</p>

            <h2>Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication: Principles, Advances, and Future Directions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diluka Galappaththige, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Gayan Aruma Baduge, Chintha Tellambura</p>
            <p>Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.</p>

            <h2>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Eichelbeck, Hannah Markgraf, Matthias Althoff</p>
            <p>The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</p>
