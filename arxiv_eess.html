            <h2>Fuzzy Model Identification and Self Learning with Smooth Compositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ebrahim Navid Sadjadi, Jesus Garcia, Jose M. Molina, Akbar Hashemi Borzabadi, Monireh Asadi Abchouyeh</p>
            <p>This paper develops a smooth model identification and self-learning strategy for dynamic systems taking into account possible parameter variations and uncertainties. We have tried to solve the problem such that the model follows the changes and variations in the system on a continuous and smooth surface. Running the model to adaptively gain the optimum values of the parameters on a smooth surface would facilitate further improvements in the application of other derivative based optimization control algorithms such as MPC or robust control algorithms to achieve a combined modeling-control scheme. Compared to the earlier works on the smooth fuzzy modeling structures, we could reach a desired trade-off between the model optimality and the computational load. The proposed method has been evaluated on a test problem as well as the non-linear dynamic of a chemical process.</p>

            <h2>Integrated Strategy for Urban Traffic Optimization: Prediction, Adaptive Signal Control, and Distributed Communication via Messaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ismail Zrigui, Samira Khoulji, Mohamed Larbi Kerkeb</p>
            <p>This work introduces an integrated approach to optimizing urban traffic by combining predictive modeling of vehicle flow, adaptive traffic signal control, and a modular integration architecture through distributed messaging. Using real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings). Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport, and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges of urban mobility.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Generalized Dynamic Games with Coupled Chance Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Shahram Yadollahi, Hamed Kebriaei, Sadegh Soudjani</p>
            <p>Designing multi-agent systems with safety constraints and uncertain dynamics is a challenging problem. This paper studies a stochastic dynamic non-cooperative game with coupling safety chance constraints. The uncertainty is assumed to satisfy a concentration of measure property. Firstly, due to the non-convexity of chance constraints, a convex under-approximation of chance constraints is given using constraints on the expectation. Then, the conditions for the existence of the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) of the under-approximated game are investigated, and the relation between the $\varepsilon-$SGNE of the original game and the under-approximated one is derived. A sampling-based algorithm is proposed for the SGNE seeking of the under-approximated game that does not require knowing the distribution of the uncertainty nor the analytical computation of expectations. Finally, under some assumptions on the game's pseudo-gradient mapping, the almost sure convergence of the algorithm to SGNE is proven. A numerical study is carried out on demand-side management in microgrids with shared battery to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Transmission Node DER Aggregation: Chance-Constrained Unit Commitment with Bounded Hetero-Dimensional Mixture Model for Uncertain Distribution Factors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilun Wang, Zhentong Shao, Yikui Liu, Brent Eldridge, Abhishek Somani, Jesse T. Holzer, Lei Wu</p>
            <p>To facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the wholesale market while maintaining the tractability of associated market operation tools such as unit commitment (UC), existing DER aggregation (DERA) studies usually consider that each DERA is presented on a single node of the transmission network. Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical distribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission nodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs (M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows is a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to DERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the distribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in industry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC (CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs, treated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against aggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are modeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging historical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space. With this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which is reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders decomposition. The proposed method is tested on an IEEE 24-bus system to illustrate its effectiveness in managing M-DERA integration while ensuring operational economics and mitigating the overloading of transmission lines.</p>

            <h2>Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liudong Chen, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasi-concave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasi-concave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</p>

            <h2>AC-aware Optimization Framework for Under-Frequency Load Shedding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mazen Elsaadany, Muhammad Hamza Ali, Amritanshu Pandey, Mads R.Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) prevents system collapse during large disturbances. Increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and reduced system inertia makes it challenging to design a static UFLS scheme, which relies on preset frequency thresholds and load shed fractions to meet design criteria across all possible operating conditions. Due to non-linearity and traceability issues, previous adaptive UFLS schemes use simplified tractable frequency models that overlook AC network effects such as voltage-dependent load/generation. This paper leverages model order reduction techniques to obtain a higher fidelity low-order model of system frequency dynamics that captures AC network effects while incorporating turbine governor action and their associated limits. The model is then used in a new AC-aware predictive optimization framework to adapt UFLS setpoints periodically based on current operating conditions while minimizing load shed. Validated on a 1,648-bus system with PSS/E simulations, the proposed method meets design criteria under various operating conditions and disturbance scenarios. Furthermore, the framework outperforms conventional static UFLS schemes and adaptive UFLS schemes based on simplified dynamic models.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Robust Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection Through Self-Supervised Pretraining</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holger Severin Bovbjerg (1), Jan Østergaard (1), Jesper Jensen (1 and 2), Zheng-Hua Tan (1) ((1) Aalborg University, (2) Oticon A/S)</p>
            <p>Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) is the task of detecting the presence of speech from a known target-speaker in an audio frame. Recently, deep neural network-based models have shown good performance in this task. However, training these models requires extensive labelled data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, particularly if generalization to unseen environments is crucial. To mitigate this, we propose a causal, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pretraining framework, called Denoising Autoregressive Predictive Coding (DN-APC), to enhance TS-VAD performance in noisy conditions. We also explore various speaker conditioning methods and evaluate their performance under different noisy conditions. Our experiments show that DN-APC improves performance in noisy conditions, with a general improvement of approx. 2% in both seen and unseen noise. Additionally, we find that FiLM conditioning provides the best overall performance. Representation analysis via tSNE plots reveals robust initial representations of speech and non-speech from pretraining. This underscores the effectiveness of SSL pretraining in improving the robustness and performance of TS-VAD models in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>RadHop-Net: A Lightweight Radiomics-to-Error Regression for False Positive Reduction In MRI Prostate Cancer Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasileios Magoulianitis, Jiaxin Yang, Catherine A. Alexander, C.-C. Jay Kuo</p>
            <p>Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is a leading cause of cancer death in men, yet it has a high survival rate if diagnosed early. Bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI) reading has become a prominent screening test for csPCa. However, this process has a high false positive (FP) rate, incurring higher diagnostic costs and patient discomfort. This paper introduces RadHop-Net, a novel and lightweight CNN for FP reduction. The pipeline consists of two stages: Stage 1 employs data driven radiomics to extract candidate ROIs. In contrast, Stage 2 expands the receptive field about each ROI using RadHop-Net to compensate for the predicted error from Stage 1. Moreover, a novel loss function for regression problems is introduced to balance the influence between FPs and true positives (TPs). RadHop-Net is trained in a radiomics-to-error manner, thus decoupling from the common voxel-to-label approach. The proposed Stage 2 improves the average precision (AP) in lesion detection from 0.407 to 0.468 in the publicly available pi-cai dataset, also maintaining a significantly smaller model size than the state-of-the-art.</p>

            <h2>UDMC: Unified Decision-Making and Control Framework for Urban Autonomous Driving with Motion Prediction of Traffic Participants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haichao Liu, Kai Chen, Yulin Li, Zhenmin Huang, Ming Liu, Jun Ma</p>
            <p>Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making and motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance, especially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP), considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency, robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared against various baseline models.

            <h2>Energy Optimization of Multi-task DNN Inference in MEC-assisted XR Devices: A Lyapunov-Guided Reinforcement Learning Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanzan Sun, Jiacheng Qiu, Guangjin Pan, Shugong Xu, Shunqing Zhang, Xiaoyun Wang, Shuangfeng Han</p>
            <p>Extended reality (XR), blending virtual and real worlds, is a key application of future networks. While AI advancements enhance XR capabilities, they also impose significant computational and energy challenges on lightweight XR devices. In this paper, we developed a distributed queue model for multi-task DNN inference, addressing issues of resource competition and queue coupling. In response to the challenges posed by the high energy consumption and limited resources of XR devices, we designed a dual time-scale joint optimization strategy for model partitioning and resource allocation, formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. This strategy aims to minimize the total energy consumption of XR devices while ensuring queue stability and adhering to computational and communication resource constraints. To tackle this problem, we devised a Lyapunov-guided Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, named LyaPPO. Numerical results demonstrate that the LyaPPO algorithm outperforms the baselines, achieving energy conservation of 24.79% to 46.14% under varying resource capacities. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption of XR devices by 24.29% to 56.62% compared to baseline algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Markov Decision Processes for Satellite Maneuver Planning and Collision Avoidance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Kuhl, Jun Wang, Duncan Eddy, Mykel Kochenderfer</p>
            <p>This paper presents a decentralized, online planning approach for scalable maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning, such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge, thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based collision avoidance techniques.</p>

            <h2>Spectrum Sharing in 6G Space-Ground Integrated Networks: A Ground Protection Zone-Based Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bodong Shang, Xiangyu Li, Zheng Wang, Junchao Ma</p>
            <p>Space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has been envisioned as a competitive solution for large scale and wide coverage of future wireless networks. By integrating both the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and the terrestrial network (TN), SGIN can provide high speed and omnipresent wireless network access for the users using the predefined licensed spectrums. Considering the scarcity of the spectrum resource and the low spectrum efficiency of the SGIN, we enable the NTN and TN to share the spectrum to improve overall system performance, i.e., weighted-sum area data rate (WS-ADR). However, mutual interference between NTN and TN is often inevitable and thus causes SGIN performance degradation. In this work, we consider a ground protection zone for the TN base stations, in which the NTN users are only allowed to use the NTN reserved spectrum to mitigate the NTN and TN mutual interference. We analytically derive the coverage probability and area data rate (ADR) of the typical users and study the performance under various protection zone sizes and spectrum allocation parameter settings. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the WS-ADR could be maximized by selecting the appropriate radius of protection zone and bandwidth allocation factor in the SGIN.</p>

            <p>With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance, particularly in intricate and dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The first stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.</p>

            <h2>Joint Task Offloading and Routing in Wireless Multi-hop Networks Using Biased Backpressure Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongyuan Zhao, Jake Perazzone, Gunjan Verma, Kevin Chan, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra</p>
            <p>A significant challenge for computation offloading in wireless multi-hop networks is the complex interaction among traffic flows in the presence of interference. Existing approaches often ignore these key effects and/or rely on outdated queueing and channel state information. To fill these gaps, we reformulate joint offloading and routing as a routing problem on an extended graph with physical and virtual links. We adopt the state-of-the-art shortest path-biased Backpressure routing algorithm, which allows the destination and the route of a job to be dynamically adjusted at every time step based on network-wide long-term information and real-time states of local neighborhoods. In large networks, our approach achieves smaller makespan than existing approaches, such as separated Backpressure offloading and joint offloading and routing based on linear programming.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongpu Zhang, Yulu Guo, Liuxun Xue, Xingchen Liu, Shu Sun, Ruifeng Gao, Xianghao Yu, Meixia Tao</p>
            <p>This paper studies energy-efficient hybrid beamforming architectures and its algorithm design in millimeter-wave communication systems, aiming to address the challenges faced by existing hybrid beamforming due to low hardware flexibility and high power consumption. To solve the problems of existing hybrid beamforming, a novel energy-efficient hybrid beamforming architecture is proposed, where radio-frequency (RF) switch networks are introduced at the front and rear ends of the phase shifter network, enabling dynamic connections between the RF chains and the phase shifter array as well as the antenna array. The system model of the proposed architecture is established, including digital precoding and analog precoding processes, and the practical hardware limitations such as quantization errors of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and phase shifter resolution. In order to maximize the energy efficiency, this paper derives an energy efficiency model including spectral efficiency and system power consumption, and a hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed based on block coordinate descent to iteratively optimize the digital precoding matrix, analog precoding matrix, and DAC resolution. Simulation results under the NYUSIM-generated millimeter-wave channels show that the proposed hybrid beamforming architecture and precoding algorithm have higher energy efficiency than existing representative architectures and precoding algorithms under complete and partial channel state information, while the loss of spectral efficiency compared to fully connected architecture is less than 20%</p>

            <p>The Northwestern University Freight Rail Infrastructure and Energy Network Decarbonization (NUFRIEND) framework is a comprehensive industry-oriented tool for simulating the deployment of new energy technologies including biofuels, e-fuels, battery-electric, and hydrogen locomotives. By classifying fuel types into two categories based on deployment requirements, the associated optimal charging/fueling facility location and sizing problem are solved with a five-step framework. Life cycle analyses (LCA) and techno-economic analyses (TEA) are used to estimate carbon reduction, capital investments, cost of carbon reduction, and operational impacts, enabling sensitivity analysis with operational and technological parameters. The framework is illustrated on lower-carbon drop-in fuels as well as battery-electric technology deployments for US Eastern and Western Class I railroad networks. Drop-in fuel deployments are modeled as admixtures with diesel in existing locomotives, while battery-electric deployments are shown for varying technology penetration levels and locomotive ranges. When mixed in a 50 percent ratio with diesel, results show biodiesel's capacity to reduce emissions at 36 percent with a cost of 0.13 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, while e-fuels offer a 50 percent emissions reduction potential at a cost of 0.22 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced. Battery-electric results for 50 percent deployment over all ton-miles highlight the value of future innovations in battery energy densities as scenarios assuming 800-mile range locomotives show an estimated emissions reduction of 46 percent with a cost of 0.06 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, compared to 16 percent emissions reduction at a cost of 0.11 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced for 400-mile range locomotives.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max T.M. Ng, Meredith Raymer, Hani S. Mahmassani, Omer Verbas, Taner Cokyasar</p>
            <p>This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs (equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas (equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget. Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is explicitly incorporated into the design objective.</p>

            <h2>A Complex Frequency-Based Control for Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Bernal, F. Milano</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel control for Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) based on the Complex Frequency (CF) concept. The controller's objective is to maintain a constant CF of the voltage at the terminals of the IBR by adjusting its current reference. This current is imposed based on the well-known power flow equation, the dynamics of which are calculated through the estimation of the CF of the voltages of the adjacent buses. Performance is evaluated by analyzing local variations in frequency and magnitude of the voltage, as well as the response of the system's Center of Inertia (CoI) frequency, and then compared with conventional frequency droop, PI voltage controllers and virtual inertia. The case study utilizes the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus model of the Irish transmission grid and considers various contingencies and sensitivities such as the impact of limiters, delays, noise, R/X ratio, and EMT dynamics. Results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the conventional controllers, leading to significant improvements in the overall dynamic response of the system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengheng Liu, Xingkang Li, Zihuan Mao, Peng Liu, Yongming Huang</p>
            <p>High-accuracy positioning has become a fundamental enabler for intelligent connected devices. Nevertheless, the present wireless networks still rely on model-driven approaches to achieve positioning functionality, which are susceptible to performance degradation in practical scenarios, primarily due to hardware impairments. Integrating artificial intelligence into the positioning framework presents a promising solution to revolutionize the accuracy and robustness of location-based services. In this study, we address this challenge by reformulating the problem of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation into image reconstruction of spatial spectrum. To this end, we design a model-driven deep neural network (MoD-DNN), which can automatically calibrate the angular-dependent phase error. The proposed MoD-DNN approach employs an iterative optimization scheme between a convolutional neural network and a sparse conjugate gradient algorithm. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing spectrum calibration and AoA estimation.</p>

            <p>This paper presents the development of "Control-Sync," a novel firmware for universal inverters in microgrids, designed to enhance grid stability and flexibility. As hybrid PV-battery systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a critical need for inverters capable of efficiently transitioning between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes.

Key features include direct phase-angle detection and frequency restoration capabilities, essential for managing asymmetrical power grids and dynamic load changes. The efficacy of Control-Sync is demonstrated through rigorous testing with grid emulators and multi-phase inverters, confirming its potential to improve microgrid reliability and efficiency.

            <h2>Integrating Cascade Pumped Micro-Hydro Storage: A Sustainable Approach to Energy and Water Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oraib Dawaghreh, Sharaf K. Magableh, Xuesong Wang, Mohammad Adnan Magableh, Caisheng Wang</p>
            <p>As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Defense Framework for DC Microgrids Against Exponentially Unbounded False Data Injection Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhang, Mohamadamin Rajabinezhad, Yichao Wang, Junbo Zhao, Shan Zuo</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel, fully distributed control framework for DC microgrids, enhancing resilience against exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Our framework features a consensus-based secondary control for each converter, effectively addressing these advanced threats. To further safeguard sensitive operational data, a privacy-preserving mechanism is incorporated into the control design, ensuring that critical information remains secure even under adversarial conditions. Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis confirms the framework's ability to maintain critical DC microgrid operations like voltage regulation and load sharing under EU-FDI threats. The framework's practicality is validated through hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating its enhanced resilience and robust privacy protection against the complex challenges posed by quick variant FDI attacks.</p>

            <h2>Temperature-Controlled Smart Charging for Electric Vehicles in Cold Climates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grant Ruan, Munther A. Dahleh</p>
            <p>The battery performance and lifespan of electric vehicles (EVs) degrade significantly in cold climates, requiring a considerable amount of energy to heat up the EV batteries. This paper proposes a novel technology, namely temperature-controlled smart charging, to coordinate the heating/charging power and reduce the total energy use of a solar-powered EV charging station. Instead of fixing the battery temperature setpoints, we analyze the thermal dynamics and inertia of EV batteries, and decide the optimal timing and proper amount of energy allocated for heating. In addition, a temperature-sensitive charging model is formulated with consideration of dynamic charging rates as well as battery health. We further tailor acceleration algorithms for large-scale EV charging, including the reduced-order dual decomposition and vehicle rescheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed temperature-controlled smart charging is superior in capturing the flexibility value of EV batteries and making full use of the rooftop solar energy. The proposed model typically achieves a 12.5--18.4% reduction in the charging cost and a 0.4--6.8% drop in the overhead energy use for heating.</p>

            <h2>Electricity Market-Clearing With Extreme Events</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomas Tapia, Zhirui Liang, Charalambos Konstantinou, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this gap in both research and practice, we propose managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through an additional reserve service, termed extreme reserve. The procurement of extreme reserve is co-optimized with energy and regular reserve using a large deviation theory chance-constrained (LDT-CC) model, where LDT offers a mathematical framework to quantify the increased uncertainty during extreme events. To mitigate the high additional costs associated with reserve scheduling under the LDT-CC model, we also propose an LDT model based on weighted chance constraints (LDT-WCC). This model prepares the power system for extreme events at a lower cost, making it a less conservative alternative to the LDT-CC model. The proposed market design leads to a competitive equilibrium while ensuring cost recovery. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system highlight the advantages of the proposed market design.</p>

            <h2>An Econometric Analysis of Large Flexible Cryptocurrency-mining Consumers in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subir Majumder, Ignacio Aravena, Le Xie</p>
            <p>In recent years, power grids have seen a surge in large cryptocurrency mining firms, with individual consumption levels reaching 700MW. This study examines the behavior of these firms in Texas, focusing on how their consumption is influenced by cryptocurrency conversion rates, electricity prices, local weather, and other factors. We transform the skewed electricity consumption data of these firms, perform correlation analysis, and apply a seasonal autoregressive moving average model for analysis. Our findings reveal that, surprisingly, short-term mining electricity consumption is not directly correlated with cryptocurrency conversion rates. Instead, the primary influencers are the temperature and electricity prices. These firms also respond to avoid transmission and distribution network (T&D) charges - commonly referred to as four Coincident peak (4CP) charges - during the summer months. As the scale of these firms is likely to surge in future years, the developed electricity consumption model can be used to generate public, synthetic datasets to understand the overall impact on the power grid. The developed model could also lead to better pricing mechanisms to effectively use the flexibility of these resources towards improving power grid reliability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties.

Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Runtao Ren, Yinyu Wu, Xuhui Zhang, Jinke Ren, Yanyan Shen, Shuqiang Wang, Kim-Fung Tsang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalin E. Sagduyu, Tugba Erpek</p>
            <p>LoRa provides long-range, energy-efficient communications in Internet of Things (IoT) applications that rely on Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) capabilities. Despite these merits, concerns persist regarding the security of LoRa networks, especially in situations where device identification and authentication are imperative to secure the reliable access to the LoRa networks. This paper explores a deep learning (DL) approach to tackle these concerns, focusing on two critical tasks, namely (i) identifying LoRa devices and (ii) classifying them to legitimate and rogue devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs), encompassing both convolutional and feedforward neural networks, are trained for these tasks using actual LoRa signal data. In this setting, the adversaries may spoof rogue LoRa signals through the kernel density estimation (KDE) method based on legitimate device signals that are received by the adversaries. Two cases are considered, (i) training two separate classifiers, one for each of the two tasks, and (ii) training a multi-task classifier for both tasks. The vulnerabilities of the resulting DNNs to manipulations in input samples are studied in form of untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Individual and common perturbations are considered against single-task and multi-task classifiers for the LoRa signal analysis. To provide resilience against such attacks, a defense approach is presented by increasing the robustness of classifiers with adversarial training. Results quantify how vulnerable LoRa signal classification tasks are to adversarial attacks and emphasize the need to fortify IoT applications against these subtle yet effective threats.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <h2>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An associated GitHub repository collecting the latest papers and repos is available at this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties.

Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2>Resource Allocation for ISAC Networks with Application to Target Tracking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Wang, Luis F. Abanto-Leon</p>
            <p>Future 6G networks are expected to empower communication systems by integrating sensing capabilities, resulting in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, this integration may exacerbate the data traffic congestion in existing communication systems due to limited resources. Therefore, the resources of ISAC systems must be carefully allocated to ensure high performance. Given the increasing demands for both sensing and communication services, current methods are inadequate for tracking targets frequently in every frame while simultaneously communicating with users. To address this gap, this work formulates an optimization problem that jointly allocates resources in the time, frequency, power, and spatial domains for targets and users, accounting for the movement of targets and time-varying communication channels. Specifically, we minimize the trace of posterior Cramér-Rao bound for target tracking subject to communication throughput and resource allocation constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty method, successive convex approximation (SCA), and one-dimensional search. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm and the performance trade-off between sensing and communication.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant challenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless communication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in real-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are short of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

Specifically, a latency minimization problem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio, transmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an LLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly dynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces latency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement under varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under distinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show the effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation problems in MEC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Full-Bandwidth Sensing Performance with Partial Bandwidth Allocation for ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Xiao, Zhiwen Zhou, Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Fei Yang, Yan Chen</p>
            <p>This letter studies an uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) transmission. We try to answer the following fundamental question: With only a fractional bandwidth allocated to the user with sensing task, can the same delay resolution and unambiguous range be achieved as if all bandwidth were allocated to it? We affirmatively answer the question by proposing a novel two-stage delay estimation (TSDE) method that exploits the following facts: without increasing the allocated bandwidth, higher delay resolution can be achieved via distributed subcarrier allocation compared to its collocated counterpart, while there is a trade-off between delay resolution and unambiguous range by varying the decimation factor of subcarriers. Therefore, the key idea of the proposed TSDE method is to first perform coarse delay estimation with collocated subcarriers to achieve a large unambiguous range, and then use distributed subcarriers with optimized decimation factor to enhance delay resolution while avoiding delay ambiguity. Our analysis shows that the proposed TSDE method can achieve the full-bandwidth delay resolution and unambiguous range, by using only at most half of the full bandwidth, provided that the channel delay spread is less than half of the unambiguous range. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over the conventional method with collocated subcarriers.</p>

According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <h2>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 66% of the total generation in Brazil in 2023 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, one of the most important steps in the operation planning of this country is the forecast of the natural inflow energy (NIE) time series, an approximation of the energetic value of the water inflows. To manage water resources over time, the Brazilian system operator performs long-term forecasts for the NIE to assess the water values through long-term hydrothermal planning models, which are then used to define the short-term merit order in day-ahead scheduling. Therefore, monitoring optimistic bias in NIE forecasts is crucial to prevent an optimistic view of future system conditions and subsequent riskier storage policies. In this article, we investigate and showcase strong evidence of an optimistic bias in the official NIE forecasts, with predicted values consistently exceeding the observations over the past 12 years in the two main subsystems (Southeast and Northeast). Rolling window out-of-sample tests conducted with real data demonstrate that the official forecast model exhibits a statistically significant bias of 6%, 13%, 18%, and 23% for 1, 6, 12, and 24 steps ahead in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 80%, and 108% in the Northeast.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanting Lyu, Songjie Yang, Yue Xiu, Zhongpei Zhang, Chadi Assi, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by movable antennas (MAs). A bistatic radar system, in which the base station (BS) is configured with MAs, is integrated into a multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) system. Flexible beamforming is studied by jointly optimizing the antenna coefficients and the antenna positions. Compared to conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), MAs provide a new degree of freedom (DoF) in beamforming to reconfigure the field response, and further improve the received signal quality for both wireless communication and sensing. We propose a communication rate and sensing mutual information (MI) maximization problem by flexible beamforming optimization. The complex fractional objective function with logarithms are first transformed with the fractional programming (FP) framework. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to address the non-convex problem with coupled variables by alternatively solving four sub-problems. We derive the closed-form expression to update the antenna coefficients by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To improve the direct gradient ascent (DGA) scheme in updating the positions of the antennas, a 3-stage search-based projected GA (SPGA) method is proposed. Simulation results show that MAs significantly enhance the overall performance of the ISAC system, achieving 59.8\% performance gain compared to conventional ISAC system enabled by FPAs. Meanwhile, the proposed SPGA-based method has remarkable performance improvement compared the DGA method in antenna position optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge.

This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP.

            <p>We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <p>The movable antenna (MA)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system attracts widespread attention as an innovative framework. The ISAC system integrates sensing and communication functions, achieving resource sharing across various domains, significantly enhancing communication and sensing performance, and promoting the intelligent interconnection of everything. Meanwhile, MA utilizes the spatial variations of wireless channels by dynamically adjusting the positions of MA elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve the channel and further enhance the performance of the ISAC systems. In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yida Wang, Guojie Hu, Xiaoling Hu, Xingbo Lu, Yuzhen Huang</p>
            <p>In this paper, we construct a framework of the movable antenna (MA) aided covert communication shielded by the general noise uncertainty for the first time. According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

In this paper, we first outline the fundamental principles of MA and introduce the application scenarios of MA-enabled ISAC systems. Then, we summarize the advantages of MA-enabled ISAC systems in enhancing spectral efficiency, achieving flexible and precise beamforming, and making the signal coverage range adjustable. Besides, a specific case is studied to show the performance gains in terms of transmit power that MA brings to ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss the challenges of MA-enabled ISAC and future research directions, aiming to provide insights for future research on MA-enabled ISAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Array Sensor Selection in ISAC with Identifiability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Rajamäki, Piya Pal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates array geometry and waveform design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) employing sensor selection. We consider ISAC via index modulation, where various subsets of transmit (Tx) sensors are used for both communications and monostatic active sensing. The set of Tx subarrays make up a codebook, whose cardinality we maximize (for communications) subject to guaranteeing a desired target identifiability (for sensing). To characterize the size of this novel optimal codebook, we derive first upper and lower bounds, which are tight in case of the canonical uniform linear array (ULA) and any nonredundant array. We show that the ULA achieves a large codebook - comparable to the size of the conventional unconstrained case - as satisfying the identifiability constraint only requires including two specific sensors in each Tx subarray (codeword). In contrast, nonredundant arrays, which have the largest identifiability for a given number of physical sensors, only have a single admissible codeword, rendering them ineffectual for communications via sensor selection alone. The results serve as a step towards an analytical understanding of the limits of sensor selection in ISAC and the fundamental trade-offs therein.</p>

According to the analysis performance on the derived closed-form expressions of the sum of the probabilities of the detection errors and the communication outage probability, the perfect covertness and the ultra reliability can be achieved by adjusting the antenna position in the MA array. Then, we formulate the communication covertness maximization problem with the constraints of the ultra reliability and the independent discrete movable position to optimize the transmitter's parameter. With the maximal ratio transmitting (MRT) design for the beamforming, we solve the closed-form optimal information transmit power and design a lightweight discrete projected gradient descent (DPGD) algorithm to determine the optimal antenna position. The numerical results show that the optimal achievable covertness and the feasible region of the steering angle with the MA array is significant larger than the one with the fixed-position antenna (FPA) array.</p>

            <p>We propose a single-channel Deep Cascade Fusion of Diarization and Separation (DCF-DS) framework for back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), combining neural speaker diarization (NSD) and speech separation (SS). First, we sequentially integrate the NSD and SS modules within a joint training framework, enabling the separation module to leverage speaker time boundaries from the diarization module effectively. Then, to complement DCF-DS training, we introduce a window-level decoding scheme that allows the DCF-DS framework to handle the sparse data convergence instability (SDCI) problem. We also explore using an NSD system trained on real datasets to provide more accurate speaker boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate an optional multi-input multi-output speech enhancement module (MIMO-SE) within the DCF-DS framework, which offers further performance gains. Finally, we enhance diarization results by re-clustering DCF-DS outputs, improving ASR accuracy. By incorporating the DCF-DS method, we achieved first place in the realistic single-channel track of the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 challenge. We also perform the evaluation on the open LibriCSS dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art single-channel speech recognition performance.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Real-Time Load Balancing User Association and Handover in Mobile Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Alizadeh, Byungju Lim, Mai Vu</p>
            <p>As next generation cellular networks become denser, associating users with the optimal base stations at each time while ensuring no base station is overloaded becomes critical for achieving stable and high network performance. We propose multi-agent online Q-learning (QL) algorithms for performing real-time load balancing user association and handover in dense cellular networks. The load balancing constraints at all base stations couple the actions of user agents, and we propose two multi-agent action selection policies, one centralized and one distributed, to satisfy load balancing at every learning step. In the centralized policy, the actions of UEs are determined by a central load balancer (CLB) running an algorithm based on swapping the worst connection to maximize the total learning reward. In the distributed policy, each UE takes an action based on its local information by participating in a distributed matching game with the BSs to maximize the local reward. We then integrate these action selection policies into an online QL algorithm that adapts in real-time to network dynamics including channel variations and user mobility, using a reward function that considers a handover cost to reduce handover frequency. The proposed multi-agent QL algorithm features low-complexity and fast convergence, outperforming 3GPP max-SINR association. Both policies adapt well to network dynamics at various UE speed profiles from walking, running, to biking and suburban driving, illustrating their robustness and real-time adaptability.</p>

            <h2>Online Low-Carbon Workload, Energy, and Temperature Management of Distributed Data Centers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Xie, Yue Chen, Xi Weng</p>
            <p>Data centers have become one of the major energy consumers, making their low-carbon operations critical to achieving global carbon neutrality. Although distributed data centers have the potential to reduce costs and emissions through cooperation, they are facing challenges due to uncertainties. This paper proposes an online approach to co-optimize the workload, energy, and temperature strategies across distributed data centers, targeting minimal total cost, controlled carbon emissions, and adherence to operational constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is adopted to derive a parametric real-time strategy that accommodates uncertainties in workload demands, ambient temperature, electricity prices, and carbon intensities, without requiring prior knowledge of their distributions. A theoretical upper bound for the optimality gap is derived, based on which a linear programming problem is proposed to optimize the strategy parameters, enhancing performance while ensuring operational constraints. Case studies and method comparison validate the proposed method's effectiveness in reducing costs and carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scheme for the low-altitude sensing scenario, aiming at estimating the parameters of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and enhancing the sensing performance via cooperation. The proposed scheme consists of two stages. In Stage I, we formulate the monostatic parameter estimation problem via using a tensor decomposition model. By leveraging the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrix, a spatial smoothing tensor decomposition scheme is introduced to estimate the UAVs' parameters. To further reduce the computational complexity, we design a reduced-dimensional (RD) angle of arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm based on generalized Rayleigh quotient (GRQ). In Stage II, the positions and true velocities of the UAVs are determined through the data fusion across multiple base stations (BSs). Specifically, we first develop a false removing minimum spanning tree (MST)-based data association method to accurately match the BSs' parameter estimations to the same UAV. Then, a Pareto optimality method and a residual weighting scheme are developed to facilitate the position and velocity estimation, respectively. We further extend our approach to the dual-polarized system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in comparison to the conventional techniques.</p>

            <h2>RUL forecasting for wind turbine predictive maintenance based on deep learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Syed Shazaib Shah, Tan Daoliang, Sah Chandan Kumar</p>
            <p>Predictive maintenance (PdM) is increasingly pursued to reduce wind farm operation and maintenance costs by accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and strategically scheduling maintenance. However, the remoteness of wind farms often renders current methodologies ineffective, as they fail to provide a sufficiently reliable advance time window for maintenance planning, limiting PdM's practicality. This study introduces a novel deep learning (DL) methodology for future RUL forecasting. By employing a multi-parametric attention-based DL approach that bypasses feature engineering, thereby minimizing the risk of human error, two models: ForeNet-2d and ForeNet-3d are proposed. These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</p>

While studies of energy use and emissions of ML models are a growing subfield, most ML researchers and developers still do not incorporate energy measurement as part of their work practices. While measuring energy is a crucial step towards reducing carbon footprint, it is also not straightforward. This paper introduces the main considerations necessary for making sound use of energy measurement tools and interpreting energy estimates, including the use of at-the-wall versus on-device measurements, sampling strategies and best practices, common sources of error, and proxy measures. It also contains practical tips and real-world scenarios that illustrate how these considerations come into play.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyi Wang, Huan Zhao, Yuji Cao, Zibin Pan, Guolong Liu, Gaoqi Liang, Junhua Zhao</p>
            <p>The Wind Storage Integrated System with Power Smoothing Control (PSC) has emerged as a promising solution to ensure both efficient and reliable wind energy generation. However, existing PSC strategies overlook the intricate interplay and distinct control frequencies between batteries and wind turbines, and lack consideration of wake effect and battery degradation cost. In this paper, a novel coordinated control framework with hierarchical levels is devised to address these challenges effectively, which integrates the wake model and battery degradation model. In addition, after reformulating the problem as a Markov decision process, the multi-agent reinforcement learning method is introduced to overcome the bi-level characteristic of the problem. Moreover, a Physics-informed Neural Network-assisted Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PAMA-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to incorporate the power fluctuation differential equation and expedite the learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulations conducted in four distinct scenarios using WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm facilitates approximately an 11% increase in total profit and a 19% decrease in power fluctuation compared to the traditional methods, thereby addressing the dual objectives of economic efficiency and grid-connected energy reliability.</p>

            <p>We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Chen, Yang Li, Jun Cai, Songlin Gu, Ying Yan</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel approach for tracking the dynamic trajectories of integrated natural gas and power systems, leveraging a Kalman filter-based structure. To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p>

            <h2>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Liu, Bo Sun, Danny H.K. Tsang</p>
            <p>With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</p>

            <h2>Robust Economic Dispatch with Flexible Demand and Adjustable Uncertainty Set</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Liu, Su Wang, Danny H.K. Tsang</p>
            <p>With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</p>

These models successfully forecast the RUL for seven multifaceted wind turbine (WT) failures with a 2-week forecast window. The most precise forecast deviated by only 10 minutes from the actual RUL, while the least accurate prediction deviated by 1.8 days, with most predictions being off by only a few hours. This methodology offers a substantial time frame to access remote WTs and perform necessary maintenance, thereby enabling the practical implementation of PdM.</p>

            <p>The Wind Storage Integrated System with Power Smoothing Control (PSC) has emerged as a promising solution to ensure both efficient and reliable wind energy generation. However, existing PSC strategies overlook the intricate interplay and distinct control frequencies between batteries and wind turbines, and lack consideration of wake effect and battery degradation cost. In this paper, a novel coordinated control framework with hierarchical levels is devised to address these challenges effectively, which integrates the wake model and battery degradation model. In addition, after reformulating the problem as a Markov decision process, the multi-agent reinforcement learning method is introduced to overcome the bi-level characteristic of the problem. Moreover, a Physics-informed Neural Network-assisted Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PAMA-DDPG) algorithm is proposed to incorporate the power fluctuation differential equation and expedite the learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulations conducted in four distinct scenarios using WindFarmSimulator (WFSim). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm facilitates approximately an 11% increase in total profit and a 19% decrease in power fluctuation compared to the traditional methods, thereby addressing the dual objectives of economic efficiency and grid-connected energy reliability.</p>

The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Chen, Yang Li, Jun Cai, Songlin Gu, Ying Yan</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel approach for tracking the dynamic trajectories of integrated natural gas and power systems, leveraging a Kalman filter-based structure. To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p>

            <h2>Chance-Constrained Economic Dispatch with Flexible Loads and RES</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Liu, Bo Sun, Danny H.K. Tsang</p>
            <p>With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain the supply-demand balance of power systems by solely relying on the generation side. To combat the volatility led by the uncertain RESs, demand-side management by leveraging the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) has been recognized as an economic and efficient approach. Thus, it is important to integrate MDF into existing power systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced day-ahead energy market, where the MDFs of aggregate loads are traded to minimize the generation cost and mitigate the volatility of locational marginal prices (LMPs) in the transmission network. We first explicitly capture the negative impact of the uncertainty from RESs on the day-ahead market by a chance-constrained economic dispatch problem (CEDP). Then, we propose a bidding mechanism for the MDF of the aggregate loads and combine this mechanism into the CEDP for the day-ahead market. Through multiple case studies, we show that MDF from load aggregators can reduce the volatility of LMPs. In addition, we identify the values of the different flexibilities in the MDF bids, which provide useful insights into the design of more complex MDF markets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Liu, Su Wang, Danny H.K. Tsang</p>
            <p>With more renewable energy sources (RES) integrated into the power system, the intermittency of RES places a heavy burden on the system. The uncertainty of RES is traditionally handled by controllable generators to balance the real time wind power deviation. As the demand side management develops, the flexibility of aggregate loads can be leveraged to mitigate the negative impact of the wind power. In view of this, we study the problem of how to exploit the multi-dimensional flexibility of elastic loads to balance the trade-off between a low generation cost and a low system risk related to the wind curtailment and the power deficiency. These risks are captured by the conditional value-at-risk. Also, unlike most of the existing studies, the uncertainty set of the wind power output in our model is not fixed. By contrast, it is undetermined and co-optimized based on the available load flexibility. We transform the original optimization problem into a convex one using surrogate affine approximation such that it can be solved efficiently. In case studies, we apply our model on a six-bus transmission network and demonstrate that how flexible load aggregators can help to determine the optimal admissible region for the wind power deviations.</p>

            <h2>Power Efficient Cooperative Communication within IIoT Subnetworks: Relay or RIS?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Reza Hashempour, Gilberto Berardinelli, Ramoni Adeogun, Eduard A. Jorswieck</p>
            <p>The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) subnetworks are expected to support ultra-fast control communication cycles for numerous IoT devices. However, meeting the stringent requirements for low latency and high reliability poses significant challenges, particularly due to signal fading and physical obstructions. In this paper, we propose novel time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) communication protocols for cooperative transmission in IIoT subnetworks. These protocols leverage secondary access points (sAPs) as Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relays, enabling shorter cycle times while minimizing overall transmit power. A classification mechanism determines whether the highest-gain link for each IoT device is a single-hop or two-hop connection, and selects the corresponding sAP. We then formulate the problem of minimizing transmit power for DF/AF relaying while adhering to the delay and maximum power constraints. In the FDMA case, an additional constraint is introduced for bandwidth allocation to IoT devices during the first and second phases of cooperative transmission. To tackle the nonconvex problem, we employ the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method. We extend our analysis to a system model with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), enabling transmission through direct and RIS-assisted channels, and optimizing for a multi-RIS scenario for comparative analysis. Simulation results show that our cooperative communication approach reduces the emitted power by up to 7.5 dB while maintaining an outage probability and a resource overflow rate below $10^{-6}$. While the RIS-based solution achieves greater power savings, the relay-based protocol outperforms RIS in terms of outage probability.</p>

            <p>Code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) faces challenges due to the language confusion resulting from accents, auditory similarity, and seamless language switches. Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages.</p>

            <p>Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications, enabled by numerous antenna elements integrated into large antenna surfaces, can provide increased effective degree of freedom (EDoF) to achieve high diversity gain. However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via electromagnetic full-wave simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.</p>

These systems capitalize on RIS to minimize power consumption, thereby achieving consistent performance and enhancing communication quality through the establishment and shaping of auxiliary signal propagation pathways between access points (APs) and users. However, integrating RIS into existing CF mMIMO infrastructures presents several technical challenges. This study delves into the signal transmission scheme and deployment architecture of RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, addressing inherent challenges such as interference induced by RIS and the increased complexity in beam alignment. Furthermore, we address the complexities arising from the joint optimization of the reflection phase of RIS and beamforming technology at the APs, intending to fully exploit the reflection capabilities of RISs and beamforming technology to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. To overcome these challenges, we propose cooperation communication to suppress RIS-induced interference, beam tracking, and joint optimization to improve system EE. We also present specific examples of cooperative communication under the constraint of electromagnetic interference and the beam tracking of a mobile system. Additionally, we emphasize important research directions for RIS-aided CF mMIMO systems, aiming to inspire future investigations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kishan Prudhvi Guddanti, Alok Kumar Bharati, Sameer Nekkalapu, Joseph McWheter, Scott Morris</p>
            <p>The power grid is experiencing a multi-fold transformation while the global climate evolves with record-breaking extreme temperatures during heat domes, polar vortices, and severe ice. Over the decades, these extreme temperature events have increased in frequency, duration, and intensity. The power grid infrastructure is geographically spread over thousands of square miles with millions of small and large components, and the impact of extreme temperature operations on the grid infrastructure needs to be researched further. This paper reviews academic literature, standards, industry articles, and federal reports to identify the impacts of heat domes, polar vortices, and icing on all the T&D grid equipment, including substations (assets owned and operated by the utilities and independent system operators). This paper classifies the equipment into primary and auxiliary equipment and determines its vulnerability to extreme temperatures for a deeper analysis of a more critical and vulnerable set of grid equipment. For each equipment under consideration, its fundamental role in the system, the impact of extreme temperatures on its operation, available monitoring, and mitigation of these impacts are discussed. The paper develops insights on standards readiness and identifies gaps concerning extreme temperature definitions. The paper also develops summary tables to identify the critical failure modes for each type of equipment, failure influence diagrams, and cascading influence diagrams to highlight and aid in translating the equipment vulnerability information into power grid contingency definitions that need to be considered in grid planning and operations.</p>

            <h2>LSCodec: Low-Bitrate and Speaker-Decoupled Discrete Speech Codec</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Chenpeng Du, Hankun Wang, Xie Chen, Kai Yu</p>
            <p>Although discrete speech tokens have exhibited strong potential for language model-based speech generation, their high bitrates and redundant timbre information restrict the development of such models. In this work, we propose LSCodec, a discrete speech codec that has both low bitrate and speaker decoupling ability. LSCodec adopts a three-stage unsupervised training framework with a speaker perturbation technique. A continuous information bottleneck is first established, followed by vector quantization that produces a discrete speaker-decoupled space. A discrete token vocoder finally refines acoustic details from LSCodec. By reconstruction experiments, LSCodec demonstrates superior intelligibility and audio quality with only a single codebook and smaller vocabulary size than baselines. The 25Hz version of LSCodec also achieves the lowest bitrate (0.25kbps) of codecs so far with decent quality. Voice conversion evaluations prove the satisfactory speaker disentanglement of LSCodec, and ablation study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed training framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahran Rahman Alve, Muhammad Zawad Mahmud, Samiha Islam, Mohammad Monirujjaman Khan</p>
            <p>AI and deep learning are two recent innovations that have made a big difference in helping to solve problems in the clinical space. Using clinical imaging and sound examination, they also work on improving their vision so that they can spot diseases early and correctly. Because there aren't enough trained HR, clinical professionals are asking for help with innovation because it helps them adapt to more patients. Aside from serious health problems like cancer and diabetes, the effects of respiratory infections are also slowly getting worse and becoming dangerous for society. Respiratory diseases need to be found early and treated quickly, so listening to the sounds of the lungs is proving to be a very helpful tool along with chest X-rays. The presented research hopes to use deep learning ideas based on Convolutional Brain Organization to help clinical specialists by giving a detailed and thorough analysis of clinical respiratory sound data for Ongoing Obstructive Pneumonic identification. We used MFCC, Mel-Spectrogram, Chroma, Chroma (Steady Q), and Chroma CENS from the Librosa AI library in the tests we ran. The new system could also figure out how serious the infection was, whether it was mild, moderate, or severe. The test results agree with the outcome of the deep learning approach that was proposed. The accuracy of the framework arrangement has been raised to a score of 96% on the ICBHI. Also, in the led tests, we used K-Crisp Cross-Approval with ten parts to make the presentation of the new deep learning approach easier to understand. With a 96 percent accuracy rate, the suggested network is better than the rest. If you don't use cross-validation, the model is 90% accurate.</p>

            <h2>BEST-STD: Bidirectional Mamba-Enhanced Speech Tokenization for Spoken Term Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anup Singh, Kris Demuynck, Vipul Arora</p>
            <p>Spoken term detection (STD) is often hindered by reliance on frame-level features and the computationally intensive DTW-based template matching, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that encodes speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic semantic tokens. This facilitates fast retrieval using text-based search algorithms and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary terms. Our approach focuses on generating consistent token sequences across varying utterances of the same term. We also propose a bidirectional state space modeling within the Mamba encoder, trained in a self-supervised learning framework, to learn contextual frame-level features that are further encoded into discrete tokens. Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks. Empirical evaluation on LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases indicates that our method outperforms existing STD baselines while being more efficient.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Resource-Efficient CNN Architectures for Brain Tumor Classification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Ashik Khan, Rafath Bin Zafar Auvee</p>
            <p>Accurate brain tumor classification in MRI images is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment planning. While deep learning models like ResNet-18, VGG-16 have shown high accuracy, they often come with increased complexity and computational demands. This study presents a comparative analysis of effective yet simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and pre-trained ResNet18, and VGG16 model for brain tumor classification using two publicly available datasets: Br35H:: Brain Tumor Detection 2020 and Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. The custom CNN architecture, despite its lower complexity, demonstrates competitive performance with the pre-trained ResNet18 and VGG16 models. In binary classification tasks, the custom CNN achieved an accuracy of 98.67% on the Br35H dataset and 99.62% on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. For multi-class classification, the custom CNN, with a slight architectural modification, achieved an accuracy of 98.09%, on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. Comparatively, ResNet18 and VGG16 maintained high performance levels, but the custom CNNs provided a more computationally efficient alternative. Additionally,the custom CNNs were evaluated using few-shot learning (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 80 shots) to assess their robustness, achieving notable accuracy improvements with increased shots. This study highlights the potential of well-designed, less complex CNN architectures as effective and computationally efficient alternatives to deeper, pre-trained models for medical imaging tasks, including brain tumor classification. This study underscores the potential of custom CNNs in medical imaging tasks and encourages further exploration in this direction.</p>

            <p>Accurate and automatic segmentation of brain tumors in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is essential for quantitative measurements, which play an increasingly important role in clinical diagnosis and prognosis. The International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024 offers a unique benchmarking opportunity, including various types of brain tumors in both adult and pediatric populations, such as pediatric brain tumors (PED), meningiomas (MEN-RT) and brain metastases (MET), among others. Compared to previous editions, BraTS 2024 has implemented changes to substantially increase clinical relevance, such as refined tumor regions for evaluation. We propose a deep learning-based ensemble approach that integrates state-of-the-art segmentation models. Additionally, we introduce innovative, adaptive pre- and post-processing techniques that employ MRI-based radiomic analyses to differentiate tumor subtypes. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tumors present in the BraTS datasets, this approach enhances the precision and generalizability of segmentation models. On the final testing sets, our method achieved mean lesion-wise Dice similarity coefficients of 0.926, 0.801, and 0.688 for the whole tumor in PED, MEN-RT, and MET, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving segmentation performance and generalizability for various brain tumor types.

            <p>Gliomas, a kind of brain tumor characterized by high mortality, present substantial diagnostic challenges in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper introduces a novel approach to glioma segmentation using transfer learning to address challenges in resource-limited regions with minimal and low-quality MRI data. We leverage pre-trained deep learning models, nnU-Net and MedNeXt, and apply a stratified fine-tuning strategy using the BraTS2023-Adult-Glioma and BraTS-Africa datasets. Our method exploits radiomic analysis to create stratified training folds, model training on a large brain tumor dataset, and transfer learning to the Sub-Saharan context. A weighted model ensembling strategy and adaptive post-processing are employed to enhance segmentation accuracy. The evaluation of our proposed method on unseen validation cases on the BraTS-Africa 2024 task resulted in lesion-wise mean Dice scores of 0.870, 0.865, and 0.926, for enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions and was ranked first for the challenge. Our approach highlights the ability of integrated machine-learning techniques to bridge the gap between the medical imaging capabilities of resource-limited countries and established developed regions. By tailoring our methods to a target population's specific needs and constraints, we aim to enhance diagnostic capabilities in isolated environments. Our findings underscore the importance of approaches like local data integration and stratification refinement to address healthcare disparities, ensure practical applicability, and enhance impact.

            <h2>Supertoroid fitting of objects with holes for robotic grasping and scene generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Badia Torres, Eric Carmona, Abhijit Makhal, Omid Heidari, Alba Perez Gracia</p>
            <p>One of the strategies to detect the pose and shape of unknown objects is their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities. Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders, but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to a wider variety of shapes. One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole. Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Krejčí, Oliver Kost, Ondřej Straka, Yuxuan Xia, Lennart Svensson, Ángel F. García-Fernández</p>
            <p>Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with unique performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niclas Führling, Volodymyr Vizitiv, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Hyeon Seok Rou, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Osvaldo Gonsa</p>
            <p>We propose a novel message-passing solution to the sixth-dimensional (6D) moving rigid body localization (RBL) problem, in which the three-dimensional (3D) translation vector and rotation angles, as well as their corresponding translational and angular velocities, are all estimated by only utilizing the relative range and Doppler measurements between the "anchor" sensors located at an 3D (rigid body) observer and the "target" sensors of another rigid body. The proposed method is based on a bilinear Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework, employed to estimate the absolute sensor positions and velocities using a range- and Doppler-based received signal model, which is then utilized in the reconstruction of the RBL transformation model, linearized under a small-angle approximation. The method further incorporates a second bivariate GaBP designed to directly estimate the 3D rotation angles and translation vectors, including an interference cancellation (IC) refinement stage to improve the angle estimation performance, followed by the estimation of the angular and the translational velocities. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified via simulations, which confirms its improved performance compared to equivalent state-of-the-art (SotA) techniques.</p>

            <h2>Interleaved Speech-Text Language Models are Simple Streaming Text to Speech Synthesizers</h2>

            <p>This paper introduces Interleaved Speech-Text Language Model (IST-LM) for streaming zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS). Unlike many previous approaches, IST-LM is directly trained on interleaved sequences of text and speech tokens with a fixed ratio, eliminating the need for additional efforts in duration prediction and grapheme-to-phoneme alignment. The ratio of text chunk size to speech chunk size is crucial for the performance of IST-LM. To explore this, we conducted a comprehensive series of statistical analyses on the training data and performed correlation analysis with the final performance, uncovering several key factors: 1) the distance between speech tokens and their corresponding text tokens, 2) the number of future text tokens accessible to each speech token, and 3) the frequency of speech tokens precedes their corresponding text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate how to achieve an optimal streaming TTS system without complicated engineering optimization, which has a limited gap with the non-streaming system. IST-LM is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, paving the way for streaming TTS with minimal overhead while largely maintaining performance, showcasing broad prospects coupled with real-time text stream from LLMs.</p>

            <h2>A Language Model With Million Context Length For Raw Audio</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prateek Verma</p>
            <p>Modeling long-term dependencies for audio signals is a particularly challenging problem, as even small-time scales yield on the order of a hundred thousand samples. With the recent advent of Transformers, neural architectures became good at modeling dependencies over longer time scales, but they suffered from quadratic constraints to scale them. We propose a generative auto-regressive architecture that can model audio waveforms over quite a large context, greater than 500,000 samples. Our work is adapted to learn time dependencies by learning a latent representation by a CNN front-end, and then learning dependencies over these representations using Transformer encoders, fully trained end-to-end: thereby allowing to learn representations as it deems fit for the next sample. Unlike previous works that compared different time scales to show improvement, we use a standard dataset, with the same number of parameters/context to show improvements. We achieve a state-of-the-art performance as compared to other approaches such as Wavenet, SaSHMI, and Sample-RNN on a standard dataset for modeling long-term structure. This work gives very exciting direction for the field, given improvements in context modeling that can be scaled with more data, as well as potentially better results by using billions/trillions of parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Abate, Alec Edwards, Mirco Giacobbe, Hashan Punchihewa, Diptarko Roy</p>
            <p>We present a data-driven approach to the quantitative verification of probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models. Our approach leverages neural networks to compute tight and sound bounds for the probability that a stochastic process hits a target condition within finite time. This problem subsumes a variety of quantitative verification questions, from the reachability and safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models, to the study of assertion-violation and termination analysis of probabilistic programs. We rely on neural networks to represent supermartingale certificates that yield such probability bounds, which we compute using a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop: we train the neural certificate while tightening the probability bound over samples of the state space using stochastic optimisation, and then we formally check the certificate's validity over every possible state using satisfiability modulo theories; if we receive a counterexample, we add it to our set of samples and repeat the loop until validity is confirmed. We demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmarks that, thanks to the expressive power of neural networks, our method yields smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing symbolic methods in all cases, and that our approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.</p>

            <h2>Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihab S. Mohamed, Junhong Xu, Gaurav S Sukhatme, Lantao Liu</p>
            <p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaun Azzopardi, Nir Piterman, Luca Di Stefano, Gerardo Schneider</p>
            <p>Recently interest has increased in applying reactive synthesis to more practical richer-than-Boolean domains. One of the major challenges in this area is to establish when certain repeating behaviour terminates in a desired state when the number of steps is unbounded. This isolated problem, by itself, is already undecidable, and forms part of the overall difficulty of this kind of synthesis tasks. Relatively successful approaches exist for deterministic games with at most B{ü}chi conditions. Our contribution goes beyond, being the first effective approach for solving symbolic synthesis problems with full LTL objectives, based on novel liveness refinements guided by the underlying game. Our CEGAR-based approach relies on a sound boolean abstraction of the problem, spuriousness checking of abstract counterstrategies through invariant checking, and extracting fresh safety or liveness properties of the concrete game from counterexamples. The latter are used to refine the abstraction, which is used to re-attempt synthesis. Our discrete synthesis tool outperforms the state-of-the-art on LIA benchmarks from literature. We also introduce benchmarks that are out of scope for all other approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order. We conduct various experiments to validate our theoretical findings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo Noboro Tominaga, Onel Luis Alcaraz López, Tommy Svensson, Richard Demo Souza, Hirley Alves</p>
            <p>Contemporary wireless communication systems rely on Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) techniques. In such systems, each Access Point (AP) is equipped with multiple antenna elements and serves multiple devices simultaneously. Notably, traditional systems utilize fixed antennas, i.e., antennas without any movement capabilities, while the idea of movable antennas has recently gained traction among the research community. By moving in a confined region, movable antennas are able to exploit the wireless channel variation in the continuous domain. This additional degree of freedom may enhance the quality of the wireless links, and consequently the communication performance. However, movable antennas for MU-MIMO proposed in the literature are complex, bulky, expensive and present a high power consumption. In this paper, we propose an alternative to such systems that has lower complexity and lower cost. More specifically, we propose the incorporation of rotation capabilities to APs equipped with Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs) of antennas. We consider the uplink of an indoor scenario where the AP serves multiple devices simultaneously. The optimal rotation of the ULA is computed based on estimates of the positions of the active devices and aiming at maximizing the per-user mean achievable Spectral Efficiency (SE). Adopting a spatially correlated Rician channel model, our numerical results show that the rotation capabilities of the AP can bring substantial improvements in the SE in scenarios where the line-of-sight component of the channel vectors is strong. Moreover, our proposed system is robust against imperfect positioning estimates.</p>

Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. Regarding this issue, we propose a swarm navigation algorithm and verify it under experiments.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendra I. Nurdin</p>
            <p>Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB. Examples are given where a unitary solution to the system of nonlinear partial differential equations can be explicitly calculated when the required conditions are fulfilled.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Surrogate Verification of Image-based Neural Network Control Systems using Composition and Unrolling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feiyang Cai, Chuchu Fan, Stanley Bak</p>
            <p>Verifying safety of neural network control systems that use images as input is a difficult problem because, from a given system state, there is no known way to mathematically model what images are possible in the real-world. We build on recent work that considers a surrogate verification approach, training a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as an image generator in place of the real world. This enables set-based formal analysis of the closed-loop system, providing analysis beyond simulation and testing. While existing work is effective on small examples, excessive overapproximation both within a single control period and across multiple control periods limits its scalability. We propose approaches to overcome these two sources of error. First, we overcome one-step error by composing the system's dynamics along with the cGAN and neural network controller, without losing the dependencies between input states and the control outputs as in the monotonic analysis of the system dynamics. Second, we reduce multi-step error by repeating the single-step composition, essentially unrolling multiple steps of the control loop into a large neural network. We then leverage existing network verification tools to compute accurate reachable sets for multiple steps, avoiding the accumulation of abstraction error at each step. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both accuracy and scalability using two case studies: an autonomous aircraft taxiing system and an advanced emergency braking system. On the aircraft taxiing system, the converged reachable set is 175% larger using the prior baseline method compared with our proposed approach. On the emergency braking system, with 24x the number of image output variables from the cGAN, the baseline method fails to prove any states are safe, whereas our improvements enable set-based safety analysis.</p>

            <h2>PI-Whisper: Designing an Adaptive and Incremental Automatic Speech Recognition System for Edge Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Nassereldine, Dancheng Liu, Chenhui Xu, Ruiyang Qin, Yiyu Shi, Jinjun Xiong</p>
            <p>Edge-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies are increasingly prevalent in the development of intelligent and personalized assistants. However, resource-constrained ASR models face significant challenges in adaptivity, incrementality, and inclusivity when faced with a diverse population. To tackle those challenges, we propose PI-Whisper, a novel ASR system that adaptively enhances recognition capabilities by identifying speakers' characteristics in real-time. In this work, we show how the design of PI-Whisper allows for incremental adaptation of new characteristics without the need for repetitive retraining, enhances recognition capabilities, and improves equity and fairness across diverse speaker groups. PI-Whisper demonstrates these advantages by achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing the word error rate (WER) by up to 13.7% relative to baselines while scaling linearly to computing resources.</p>

            <h2>Behavioral Learning of Dish Rinsing and Scrubbing based on Interruptive Direct Teaching Considering Assistance Rate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shumpei Wakabayashi, Kento Kawaharazuka, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba</p>
            <p>Robots are expected to manipulate objects in a safe and dexterous way. For example, washing dishes is a dexterous operation that involves scrubbing the dishes with a sponge and rinsing them with water. It is necessary to learn it safely without splashing water and without dropping the dishes. In this study, we propose a safe and dexterous manipulation system. The robot learns a dynamics model of the object by estimating the state of the object and the robot itself, the control input, and the amount of human assistance required (assistance rate) after the human corrects the initial trajectory of the robot's hands by interruptive direct teaching. By backpropagating the error between the estimated and the reference value using the acquired dynamics model, the robot can generate a control input that approaches the reference value, for example, so that human assistance is not required and the dish does not move excessively. This allows for adaptive rinsing and scrubbing of dishes with unknown shapes and properties. As a result, it is possible to generate safe actions that require less human assistance.</p>

            <h2>Full-text Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang</p>
            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential for error correction in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most research focuses on utterances from short-duration speech recordings, which are the predominant form of speech data for supervised ASR training. This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for error correction in full-text generated by ASR systems from longer speech recordings, such as transcripts from podcasts, news broadcasts, and meetings. First, we develop a Chinese dataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that involves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor. This dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both full-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the correction process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the constructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and evaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design prompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats, such as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs. Through various test settings, including homogeneous, up-to-date, and hard test sets, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs perform well in the full-text setting with different prompts, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. This establishes a promising baseline for further research. The dataset is available on the website.</p>

            <h2>Compositional Audio Representation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sripathi Sridhar, Mark Cartwright</p>
            <p>Human auditory perception is compositional in nature -- we identify auditory streams from auditory scenes with multiple sound events. However, such auditory scenes are typically represented using clip-level representations that do not disentangle the constituent sound sources. In this work, we learn source-centric audio representations where each sound source is represented using a distinct, disentangled source embedding in the audio representation. We propose two novel approaches to learning source-centric audio representations: a supervised model guided by classification and an unsupervised model guided by feature reconstruction, both of which outperform the baselines. We thoroughly evaluate the design choices of both approaches using an audio classification task. We find that supervision is beneficial to learn source-centric representations, and that reconstructing audio features is more useful than reconstructing spectrograms to learn unsupervised source-centric representations. Leveraging source-centric models can help unlock the potential of greater interpretability and more flexible decoding in machine listening.</p>

            <p>When applying parameter-efficient finetuning via LoRA onto speaker adaptive text-to-speech models, adaptation performance may decline compared to full-finetuned counterparts, especially for out-of-domain speakers.

            <p>We present NanoVoice, a personalized text-to-speech model that efficiently constructs voice adapters for multiple speakers simultaneously. NanoVoice introduces a batch-wise speaker adaptation technique capable of fine-tuning multiple references in parallel, significantly reducing training time. Beyond building separate adapters for each speaker, we also propose a parameter sharing technique that reduces the number of parameters used for speaker adaptation. By incorporating a novel trainable scale matrix, NanoVoice mitigates potential performance degradation during parameter sharing. NanoVoice achieves performance comparable to the baselines, while training 4 times faster and using 45 percent fewer parameters for speaker adaptation with 40 reference voices. Extensive ablation studies and analysis further validate the efficiency of our model.</p>

            <h2>HDMoLE: Mixture of LoRA Experts with Hierarchical Routing and Dynamic Thresholds for Fine-Tuning LLM-based ASR Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingshen Mu, Kun Wei, Qijie Shao, Yong Xu, Lei Xie</p>
            <p>Recent advancements in integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with automatic speech recognition (ASR) have performed remarkably in general domains. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of all model parameters is often employed to adapt pre-trained LLM-based ASR models to specific domains, it imposes high computational costs and notably reduces their performance in general domains. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient multi-domain fine-tuning method for adapting pre-trained LLM-based ASR models to multi-accent domains without catastrophic forgetting named \textit{HDMoLE}, which leverages hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds based on combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with the mixer of experts (MoE) and can be generalized to any linear layer. Hierarchical routing establishes a clear correspondence between LoRA experts and accent domains, improving cross-domain collaboration among the LoRA experts. Unlike the static Top-K strategy for activating LoRA experts, dynamic thresholds can adaptively activate varying numbers of LoRA experts at each MoE layer. Experiments on the multi-accent and standard Mandarin datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HDMoLE. Applying HDMoLE to an LLM-based ASR model projector module achieves similar performance to full fine-tuning in the target multi-accent domains while using only 9.6% of the trainable parameters required for full fine-tuning and minimal degradation in the source general domain.</p>

            <h2>Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mutian He, Philip N. Garner</p>
            <p>Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuwei He, Rui Liu</p>
            <p>Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize reverberant speech for the spoken content. Previous works focus on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS2KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and Gemini-generated semantic captions as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to effectively integrate both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on the respective contributions of each this http URL enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive speech experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech. Demos and code are available at: this https URL.</p>

            <p>In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers are computationally expensive, and Mambas face CUDA dependence and local correlation loss. In this paper, we propose CDXFormer, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

            <p>We participated in track 2 of the VoiceMOS Challenge 2024, which aimed to predict the mean opinion score (MOS) of singing samples. Our submission secured the first place among all participating teams, excluding the official baseline. In this paper, we further improve our submission and propose a novel Pitch-and-Spectrum-aware Singing Quality Assessment (PS-SQA) method. The PS-SQA is designed based on the self-supervised-learning (SSL) MOS predictor, incorporating singing pitch and spectral information, which are extracted using pitch histogram and non-quantized neural codec, respectively. Additionally, the PS-SQA introduces a bias correction strategy to address prediction biases caused by low-resource training samples, and employs model fusion technology to further enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that our proposed PS-SQA significantly outperforms all competing systems across all system-level metrics, confirming its strong sing quality assessment capabilities.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we consider nonsymmetric solutions to certain Lyapunov and Riccati equations and inequalities with coefficient matrices corresponding to cone-preserving dynamical systems. Most results presented here appear to be novel even in the special case of positive systems. First, we provide a simple eigenvalue criterion for a Sylvester equation to admit a cone-preserving solution. For a single system preserving a self-dual cone, this reduces to stability. Further, we provide a set of conditions equivalent to testing a given H-infinity norm bound, as in the bounded real lemma. These feature the stability of a coefficient matrix similar to the Hamiltonian, a solution to two conic inequalities, and a stabilizing cone-preserving solution to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation. Finally, we show that the H-infinity norm is attained at zero frequency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Ran, Zhichang Guo, Jia Li, Yao Li, Martin Burger, Boying Wu</p>
            <p>The removal of multiplicative Gamma noise is a critical research area in the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, where neural networks serve as a potent tool. However, real-world data often diverges from theoretical models, exhibiting various disturbances, which makes the neural network less effective. Adversarial attacks can be used as a criterion for judging the adaptability of neural networks to real data, since adversarial attacks can find the most extreme perturbations that make neural networks ineffective. In this work, the diffusion equation is designed as a regularization block to provide sufficient regularity to the whole neural network, due to its spontaneous dissipative nature. We propose a tunable, regularized neural network framework that unrolls a shallow denoising neural network block and a diffusion regularity block into a single network for end-to-end training. The linear heat equation, known for its inherent smoothness and low-pass filtering properties, is adopted as the diffusion regularization block. In our model, a single time step hyperparameter governs the smoothness of the outputs and can be adjusted dynamically, significantly enhancing flexibility. The stability and convergence of our model are theoretically proven. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively eliminates high-frequency oscillations induced by adversarial attacks. Finally, the proposed model is benchmarked against several state-of-the-art denoising methods on simulated images, adversarial samples, and real SAR images, achieving superior performance in both quantitative and visual evaluations.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized audio-driven talking head synthesis. Beyond precise lip synchronization, diffusion-based methods excel in generating subtle expressions and natural head movements that are well-aligned with the audio signal. However, these methods are confronted by slow inference speed, insufficient fine-grained control over facial motions, and occasional visual artifacts largely due to an implicit latent space derived from Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which prevent their adoption in realtime interaction applications. To address these issues, we introduce Ditto, a diffusion-based framework that enables controllable realtime talking head synthesis. Our key innovation lies in bridging motion generation and photorealistic neural rendering through an explicit identity-agnostic motion space, replacing conventional VAE representations. This design substantially reduces the complexity of diffusion learning while enabling precise control over the synthesized talking heads. We further propose an inference strategy that jointly optimizes three key components: audio feature extraction, motion generation, and video synthesis. This optimization enables streaming processing, realtime inference, and low first-frame delay, which are the functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and substantially outperforms existing methods in both motion control and realtime performance.</p>

            <p>Content creators often use music to enhance their videos, from soundtracks in movies to background music in video blogs and social media content. However, identifying the best music for a video can be a difficult and time-consuming task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for automatically retrieving a matching music clip for a given video, and vice versa. Our approach leverages annotated music labels, as well as the inherent artistic correspondence between visual and music elements. Distinct from previous cross-modal music retrieval works, our method combines both self-supervised and supervised training objectives. We use self-supervised and label-supervised contrastive learning to train a joint embedding space between music and video. We show the effectiveness of our approach by using music genre labels for the supervised training component, and our framework can be generalized to other music annotations (e.g., emotion, instrument, etc.). Furthermore, our method enables fine-grained control over how much the retrieval process focuses on self-supervised vs. label information at inference time. We evaluate the learned embeddings through a variety of video-to-music and music-to-video retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully combines self-supervised and supervised objectives and is effective for controllable music-video retrieval.</p>

In an exploratory study, we designed nine interlaced metastructures inspired from the tomb's motifs. We fabricated the metastructures using additive manufacturing and studied their vibration characteristics experimentally and numerically. We also investigated bandgap modulation with metallic inserts in honeycomb interlaced metastructures. The comprehensive study of these metastructure panels reveals their high performance in controlling elastic wave propagation and generating suitable frequency bandgaps, hence having potential applications as waveguides for noise and vibration control. Finally, we developed a novel AI-based model trained on numerical datasets for the inverse design of metastructures with a desired bandgap.</p>

            <p>With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication for sixth-generation (6G) network is emerging as a revolutionary architecture. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We commence with a retrospective analysis of AI and the evolution of large-scale AI models, underscoring their pivotal roles in shaping contemporary communication technologies. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The initial stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The subsequent stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, including digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services and support application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. Specifically, we have defined the quality of AI service, which refers to the measurement framework system of AI services within the network. In addition to these developmental stages, we thoroughly examine the standardization processes pertinent to AI in network contexts, highlighting key milestones and ongoing efforts.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoxia Liu, Shijie YU</p>
            <p>Hyperspectral anomaly detection refers to identifying pixels in the hyperspectral images that have spectral characteristics significantly different from the background. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that represents the background information using a low-rank representation. We integrate an implicit proximal denoiser prior, associated with a deep learning based denoiser, within a plug-and-play (PnP) framework to effectively remove noise from the eigenimages linked to the low-rank representation. Anomalies are characterized using a generalized group sparsity measure, denoted as $\|\cdot\|_{2,\psi}$. To solve the resulting orthogonal constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization problem, we develop a PnP-proximal block coordinate descent (PnP-PBCD) method, where the eigenimages are updated using a proximal denoiser within the PnP framework. We prove that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the PnP-PBCD method is a stationary point. We evaluate the effectiveness of the PnP-PBCD method on hyperspectral anomaly detection in scenarios with and without Gaussian noise contamination. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect anomalous objects, outperforming the competing methods that may mistakenly identify noise as anomalies or misidentify the anomalous objects due to noise interference.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sangmin Lee, Woo-Jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang</p>
            <p>Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.</p>

            <h2>Improving diabetic retinopathy screening using Artificial Intelligence: design, evaluation and before-and-after study of a custom development</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imanol Pinto, Álvaro Olazarán, David Jurío, Borja de la Osa, Miguel Sainz, Aritz Oscoz, Jerónimo Ballaz, Javier Gorricho, Mikel Galar, José Andonegui</p>
            <p>Background: The worst outcomes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be prevented by implementing DR screening programs assisted by AI. At the University Hospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus images in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening level (ophthalmologist) target patients. Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom AI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper introduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique combination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its impact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares 19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients screened after. Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing their sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for non-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\% to 86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in most of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them as referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study visualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of sight-threatening DR referred by a GP. Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which could be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening. This shows how AI devices, when seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, can help improve clinical pathways in the long term.</p>

            <p>Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) represent the future of transportation, utilizing detailed traffic information to enhance control and decision-making. Eco-driving of CAVs has the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency, and the benefits are maximized when both vehicle speed and powertrain operation are optimized. In this paper, we studied the co-optimization of vehicle speed and powertrain management for energy savings in a dual-motor electric vehicle. Control-oriented vehicle dynamics and electric powertrain models were developed to transform the problem into an optimal control problem specifically designed to facilitate real-time computation. Simulation validation was conducted using real-world data calibrated traffic simulation scenarios in Chattanooga, TN. Evaluation results demonstrated a 12.80-24.52% reduction in the vehicle's power consumption under ideal predicted traffic conditions, while maintaining benefits with various prediction uncertainties, such as Gaussian process uncertainties on acceleration and time-shift effects on predicted speed. The energy savings of the proposed eco-driving strategy are achieved through effective speed control and optimized torque allocation. The proposed model can be extended to various CAV and electric vehicle applications, with potential adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting sparse structures and synergy designs to advance situational awareness of electrical power grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>The growing threats of uncertainties, anomalies, and cyberattacks on power grids are driving a critical need to advance situational awareness which allows system operators to form a complete and accurate picture of the present and future state. Simulation and estimation are foundational tools in this process. However, existing tools lack the robustness and efficiency required to achieve the level of situational awareness needed for the ever-evolving threat landscape. Industry-standard (steady-state) simulators are not robust to blackouts, often leading to non-converging or non-actionable results. Estimation tools lack robustness to anomalous data, returning erroneous system states. Efficiency is the other major concern as nonlinearities and scalability issues make large systems slow to converge. This thesis addresses robustness and efficiency gaps through a dual-fold contribution. We first address the inherent limitations in the existing physics-based and data-driven worlds; and then transcend the boundaries of conventional algorithmic design in the direction of a new paradigm -- Physics-ML Synergy -- which integrates the strengths of the two worlds. Our approaches are built on circuit formulation which provides a unified framework that applies to both transmission and distribution. Sparse optimization acts as the key enabler to make these tools intrinsically robust and immune to random threats, pinpointing dominant sources of (random) blackouts and data errors. Further, we explore sparsity-exploiting optimizations to develop lightweight ML models whose prediction and detection capabilities are a complement to physics-based tools; and whose lightweight designs advance generalization and scalability. Finally, Physics-ML Synergy brings robustness and efficiency further against targeted cyberthreats, by interconnecting our physics-based tools with lightweight ML.</p>

            <p>To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</p>

            <p>The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</p>

            <h2>Improving diabetic retinopathy screening using Artificial Intelligence: design, evaluation and before-and-after study of a custom development</h2>

            <p>Background: The worst outcomes of diabetic retinopathy (DR) can be prevented by implementing DR screening programs assisted by AI. At the University Hospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus images in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening level (ophthalmologist) target patients. Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom AI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper introduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique combination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its impact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares 19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients screened after. Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing their sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for non-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\% to 86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in most of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them as referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study visualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of sight-threatening DR referred by a GP. Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which could be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening. This shows how AI devices, when seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, can help improve clinical pathways in the long term.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akram Shafie, Jinhong Yuan, Nan Yang, Hai Lin</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the time-frequency (TF) localization characteristics of the prototype pulse of orthogonal delay-Doppler (DD) division multiplexing modulation, namely, the DD plane orthogonal pulse (DDOP). The TF localization characteristics examine how concentrated or spread out the energy of a pulse is in the joint TF domain, the time domain (TD), and the frequency domain (FD). We first derive the TF localization metrics of the DDOP, including its TF area, its time and frequency dispersions, and its direction parameter. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the DDOP exhibits a high energy spread in the TD, FD, and the joint TF domain, while adhering to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thereafter, we discuss the potential advantages brought by the energy spread of the DDOP, especially with regard to harnessing both time and frequency diversities and enabling fine-resolution sensing. Subsequently, we examine the relationships between the time and frequency dispersions of the DDOP and those of the envelope functions of DDOP's TD and FD representations, paving the way for simplified determination of the TF localization metrics for more generalized variants of the DDOP and the pulses used in other DD domain modulation schemes. Finally, using numerical results, we validate our analysis and find further insights.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>The potential benefits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) are anticipated to play a significant role in future sub-terahertz (sub-THz) systems. However, the beam squint effect is pronounced in sub-THz systems, expanding coverage areas while severely degrading communication performance. Existing hybrid precoding designs struggle to balance both functionalities in the presence of beam squint, limiting the performance gain achievable through ISAC. To address this challenge, we propose two squint-aware hybrid precoding schemes for sub-THz systems that proactively regulate the correlation between communication and sensing channels, leveraging the inherent degrees of freedom in the hardware to enhance integrated gain. We introduce a squint-aware optimization-based hybrid precoding algorithm (SA-Opt) and develop an unsupervised learning-assisted complex-valued squint-aware network (CSP-Net) to reduce complexity, tailoring its architecture to the specific data and task characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated through simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvano Cortesi, Michele Crabolu, Prodromos-Vasileios Mekikis, Giovanni Bellusci, Christian Vogt, Michele Magno</p>
            <p>Asset tracking solutions have proven their significance in industrial contexts, as evidenced by their successful commercialization (e.g., Hilti On!Track). However, a seamless solution for matching assets with their users, such as operators of construction power tools, is still missing. By enabling assetuser matching, organizations gain valuable insights that can be used to optimize user health and safety, asset utilization, and maintenance. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this gap by leveraging existing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The proposed framework comprises the following components: i) a wearable device, ii) an IoT device attached to or embedded in the assets, iii) an algorithm to estimate the distance between assets and operators by exploiting simple received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), and iv) a cloud-based algorithm that collects all estimated distances to derive the correct asset-operator matching. The effectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through indoor and outdoor experiments in a construction setting for identifying the operator of a power tool. A physical prototype was developed to evaluate the algorithms in a realistic setup. The results demonstrated a median accuracy of 0.49m in estimating the distance between assets and users, and up to 98.6% in correctly matching users with their assets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alva Kosasih, Ozlem Tugfe Demir, Emil Bjornson</p>
            <p>A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) alters the reflection of incoming signals based on the phase-shift configuration assigned to its elements. This feature can be used to improve the signal strength for user equipments (UEs), expand coverage, and enhance spectral efficiency in wideband communication systems. Having accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable to realize the full potential of RIS-aided wideband systems. Unfortunately, CSI is challenging to acquire due to the passive nature of the RIS elements, which cannot perform transmit/receive signal processing. Recently, a parametric maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimator has been developed and demonstrated excellent estimation accuracy. However, this estimator is designed for narrowband systems with no non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths. In this paper, we develop a novel parametric ML channel estimator for RIS-assisted wideband systems, which can handle line-of-sight (LOS) paths in the base station (BS)-RIS and RIS-UE links as well as NLOS paths between the UE, BS, and RIS. We leverage the reduced subspace representation induced by the array geometry to suppress noise in unused dimensions, enabling accurate estimation of the NLOS paths. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates superior estimation performance for the BS-UE and RIS-UE channels, outperforming the existing ML channel estimator.</p>

            <h2>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enea Figini, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</p>

            <p>District heating (DH) systems play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the building sector's heat supply. While innovative low-exergy DH and cooling systems are increasingly adopted in new developments, the transformation of existing DH systems remains critical, as many still depend on fossil-based heating plants. Achieving a sustainable heat supply necessitates integrating renewable energy and waste heat sources into current DH systems and enhancing operational efficiency through measures such as reduced supply temperatures and advanced control algorithms. These improvements can reduce costs and CO2 emissions but may require infrastructure adaptations, including pipe replacements and building-level system adjustments. This paper introduces a workflow for generating DH models using publicly available data and open-source tools. Such models enable comprehensive analyses of existing DH systems, allowing for the evaluation of sustainable heat integration, operational improvements, and the testing of analytical tools, such as simulation and optimization models. The workflow, detailed in this study, combines general structural data with computational estimations to create digital representations of DH systems. These models facilitate scenario-based analyses, tool benchmarking, and the identification of necessary infrastructure adaptations. Two example DH models generated using the proposed workflow are presented, followed by a discussion of the methodology's applicability and limitations. This study demonstrates how leveraging open data and tools can advance the transformation of DH systems, supporting the transition to a sustainable heat supply infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Optimization for Energy Management: A Coherent Variational Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization, and based on the comparative analysis, the best optimizer is selected. We evaluate our approaches on IEEE 3-, 5-, 118-, and 300-bus systems, demonstrating their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Our resource comparison between the power flow and OPF matrices on quantum hardware highlights that OPF needs considerably more resources, making its implementation significantly more challenging than in previous studies. Although promising, the application of CVQLS is currently constrained by the limitations of existing quantum hardware, especially for larger power systems. To address this, we use a quantum noise simulator for testing on larger systems.</p>

            <h2>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingzhu Wen, Yong Zhou, Xiaoyang Li, Yuanming Shi, Kaibin Huang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</p>

            <h2>RIS-aided Wireless-Powered Backscatter Communications for Sustainable Internet of Underground Things</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiqiang Lin, Yijie Mao</p>
            <p>Wireless-powered underground sensor networks (WPUSNs), which enable wireless energy transfer to sensors located underground, is a promising approach for establishing sustainable internet of underground things (IoUT). To support urgent information transmission and improve resource utilization within WPUSNs, backscatter communication (BC) is introduced, resulting in what is known as wireless-powered backscatter underground sensor networks (WPBUSNs). Nevertheless, the performance of WPBUSNs is significantly limited by severe channel impairments caused by the underground soil and the blockage of direct links. To overcome this challenge, in this work, we propose integrating reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with WPBUSNs, leading to the development of RIS-aided WPBUSNs. We begin by reviewing the recent advancements in BC-WPUSNs and RIS. Then, we propose a general architecture of RIS-aided WPBUSNs across various IoUT scenarios, and discuss its advantages and implementation challenges. To illustrate the effectiveness of RIS-aided WPBUSNs, we focus on a realistic farming case study, demonstrating that our proposed framework outperforms the three benchmarks in terms of the sum throughput. Finally, we discuss the open challenges and future research directions for translating this study into practical IoUT applications.</p>

            <h2>Generative Modeling and Data Augmentation for Power System Production Simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu</p>
            <p>As a key component of power system production simulation, load forecasting is critical for the stable operation of power systems. Machine learning methods prevail in this field. However, the limited training data can be a challenge. This paper proposes a generative model-assisted approach for load forecasting under small sample scenarios, consisting of two steps: expanding the dataset using a diffusion-based generative model and then training various machine learning regressors on the augmented dataset to identify the best performer. The expanded dataset significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to the original dataset, and the diffusion model outperforms the generative adversarial model by achieving about 200 times smaller errors and better alignment in latent data distributions.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-Theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation of Utility-Scale Photovoltaic, Battery, and Grid Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Sang, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Solar PV and battery storage systems have become integral to modern power grids. Therefore, bulk grid models in real-time operation must include their physical behavior accurately for analysis and optimization. AC state estimation is critical to building real-time bulk power systems models. However, current ACSE techniques do not include detailed physics and measurements for battery and PV systems. This results in sub-optimal estimation results and subsequent less accurate bulk grid models for real-time operation. To address these challenges, we formulate a circuit-theoretic AC state estimator with accurate PV and battery systems physics and corresponding measurements. First, we propose an aggregated equivalent circuit model of the solar PV, battery, and traditional grid components. Next, we add measurements from PV and battery systems to the traditional measurement set to facilitate accurate estimation of the overall grid model. Finally, we develop a circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm that can accurately estimate grid, PV, and battery system states and is robust against erroneous parameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we estimate the states of 10k node transmission networks with hundreds of battery+PV-tied systems. We compare the accuracy against the estimation of stand-alone grid, battery, and PV systems.</p>

            <p>Flexibility provision from active distribution grids requires efficient and robust methods of optimization and control suitable to online operation. In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p>

            <h2>Comparative Analysis of Zero-Shot Capability of Time-Series Foundation Models in Short-Term Load Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Lin, Dong Yun, Weijie Xia, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Short-term load prediction (STLP) is critical for modern power distribution system operations, particularly as demand and generation uncertainties grow with the integration of low-carbon technologies, such as electric vehicles and photovoltaics. In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p>

            <h2>Heterogeneous Vulnerability of Zero-Carbon Power Grids under Climate-Technological Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.Vivienne Liu, Vivek Srikrishnan, Kenji Doering, Elnaz Kabir, Scott Steinschneider, C. Lindsay Anderson</p>
            <p>The transition to decarbonized energy systems has become a priority globally to mitigate carbon emissions and, therefore, climate change. However, the vulnerabilities of zero-carbon power grids under climatic and technological changes have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we focus on modeling the zero-carbon grid using a dataset that captures diverse future climatic-technological scenarios, with New York State as a case study. By accurately representing the topology and operational constraints of the power grid, we identify spatiotemporal heterogeneity in vulnerabilities arising from the interplay of renewable resource availability, high load, and severe transmission line congestion. Our findings reveal a need for 61-105\% more firm, zero-emission capacity to ensure system reliability. Merely increasing wind and solar capacity is ineffective in improving reliability due to transmission congestion and spatiotemporal variations in vulnerabilities. This underscores the importance of considering spatiotemporal dynamics and operational constraints when making decisions regarding additional investments in renewable resources.</p>
