            <h2>Neural Substitute Solver for Efficient Edge Inference of Power Electronic Hybrid Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Zheng, Haoyu Wang, Yangbin Zeng, Han Xu, Di Mou, Hong Li, Sergio Vazquez, Leopoldo G. Franquelo</p>
            <p>Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and monitoring. How-ever, efficiently inferring the inherent hybrid continu-ous-discrete dynamics on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a significant challenge. This letter pro-poses a neural substitute solver (NSS) approach, which is a neural-network-based framework aimed at rapid accurate inference with significantly reduced computational costs. Specifically, NSS leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming matrix operation and high-order numerical integration steps in traditional solvers, which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction compared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of high-fidelity PES dynamics.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Mean Field Framework for Aggregators Participating in Wholesale Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun He, Andrew L. Liu</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and energy storage, is transforming the grid edge, where distributed technologies and customer-side systems increasingly interact with the broader power grid. DER aggregators, entities that coordinate and optimize the actions of many small-scale DERs, play a key role in this transformation. This paper presents a hybrid Mean-Field Control (MFC) and Mean-Field Game (MFG) framework for integrating DER aggregators into wholesale electricity markets. Unlike traditional approaches that treat market prices as exogenous, our model captures the feedback between aggregators' strategies and locational marginal prices (LMPs) of electricity. The MFC component optimizes DER operations within each aggregator, while the MFG models strategic interactions among multiple aggregators. To account for various uncertainties, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL), which allows aggregators to learn optimal bidding strategies in dynamic market conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a mean-field equilibrium and validate the framework through a case study of the Oahu Island power system. Results show that our approach reduces price volatility and improves market efficiency, offering a scalable and decentralized solution for DER integration in wholesale markets.</p>

            <h2>On Decision-Dependent Uncertainties in Power Systems with High-Share Renewables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunfan Zhang, Yifan Su, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>The continuously increasing renewable energy sources (RES) and demand response (DR) are becoming important sources of system flexibility. As a consequence, decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs), interchangeably referred to as endogenous uncertainties, impose new characteristics to power system dispatch. The DDUs faced by system operators originate from uncertain dispatchable resources such as RES units or DR, while reserve providers encounter DDUs arising from the uncertain reserve deployment. This paper presents a systematic framework for addressing robust dispatch problems with DDUs. The main contributions include i) the robust characterization of DDUs with a dependency decomposition structure; ii) a generic DDU coping mechanism, manifested as the bilateral matching between uncertainty and flexibility; iii) analyses of the influence of DDU incorporation on the convexity/non-convexity of robust dispatch problems; and iv) generic solution algorithms adaptive for DDUs. Under this framework, the inherent distinctions and correlations between DDUs and DIUs are revealed, providing a fundamental theoretical basis for the economic and reliable operation of RES-dominated power systems. Applications in the source and demand sides illustrate the importance of considering DDUs and verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms for robust dispatch with DDUs.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Sizing and Control of a Grid-Connected Battery in a Stacked Revenue Model Including an Energy Community</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tudor Octavian Pocola, Valentin Robu, Jip Rietveld, Sonam Norbu, Benoit Couraud, Merlinda Andoni, David Flynn, H. Vincent Poor</p>
            <p>Recent years have seen rapid increases in intermittent renewable generation, requiring novel battery energy storage systems (BESS) solutions. One recent trend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be controlled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a stacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy communities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation capacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we study settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery operator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology for determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented, such that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery operator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and prices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of tariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a systematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when deployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing approaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of important limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of regularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we investigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and battery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in the Netherlands. For the settings in our case study, we find that a community of 200 houses with a 330 kW wind turbine can save up to 12,874 euros per year by renting just 280 kWh of battery capacity (after subtracting battery rental costs), with the methodology applicable to a wide variety of settings and tariff types.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Objective Nonlinear Power Split Control For BESS With Real-Time Simulation Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Teja Tanjavooru, Prashant Pant, Thomas Hamacher, Holger Hesse</p>
            <p>This paper presents a mixed-integer, nonlinear, multi-objective optimization strategy for optimal power allocation among parallel strings in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). High-fidelity control is achieved by co-simulating the optimizer with a BESS electro-thermal simulation that models spatial thermal dynamics of the battery, providing real-time State of Charge (SOC) and temperature feedback. The optimizer prioritizes reliability by enforcing power availability as a hard constraint and penalizing battery thermal derating. Within these bounds, the controller performs a Pareto sweep on the relative weights of inverter and battery losses to balance the trade-off between inverter efficiency and battery efficiency. The inverter loss model is based on an empirical lookup table (LUT) derived from a commercial inverter system, while the battery thermal loss model uses SOC and temperature-dependent internal resistance, with electric current computed from the battery Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM). When the optimization was applied to a two-string BESS, the competing effects of inverter and battery losses on system availability and thermal derating were observed. The balanced operation yielded improvements of 1% in battery efficiency, 1.5% in inverter efficiency, and 2% in derating efficiency, while maintaining higher availability. Additionally, a 5 degrees C reduction in BESS peak temperature also suggests reduced thermal stress without compromising availability.</p>

            <h2>AI-Driven Mobility Management for High-Speed Railway Communications: Compressed Measurements and Proactive Handover</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Li, Wei Chen, Shiyue Wang, Yuanyuan Zhang, Michail Matthaiou, Bo Ai</p>
            <p>High-speed railway (HSR) communications are pivotal for ensuring rail safety, operations, maintenance, and delivering passenger information services. The high speed of trains creates rapidly time-varying wireless channels, increases the signaling overhead, and reduces the system throughput, making it difficult to meet the growing and stringent needs of HSR applications. In this article, we explore artificial intelligence (AI)-based beam-level and cell-level mobility management suitable for HSR communications. Particularly, we propose a compressed spatial multi-beam measurements scheme via compressive sensing for beam-level mobility management in HSR communications. In comparison to traditional down-sampling spatial beam measurements, this method leads to improved spatial-temporal beam prediction accuracy with the same measurement overhead. Moreover, we propose a novel AI-based proactive handover scheme to predict handover events and reduce radio link failure (RLF) rates in HSR communications. Compared with the traditional event A3-based handover mechanism, the proposed approach significantly reduces the RLF rates which saves 50% beam measurement overhead.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating the Impact of Multiple DER Aggregators on Wholesale Energy Markets: A Hybrid Mean Field Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun He, Andrew L. Liu</p>
            <p>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale energy markets can greatly enhance grid flexibility, improve market efficiency, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future. As DERs -- such as solar PV panels and energy storage -- proliferate, effective mechanisms are needed to ensure that small prosumers can participate meaningfully in these markets. We study a wholesale market model featuring multiple DER aggregators, each controlling a portfolio of DER resources and bidding into the market on behalf of the DER asset owners. The key of our approach lies in recognizing the repeated nature of market interactions the ability of participants to learn and adapt over time. Specifically, Aggregators repeatedly interact with each other and with other suppliers in the wholesale market, collectively shaping wholesale electricity prices (aka the locational marginal prices (LMPs)). We model this multi-agent interaction using a mean-field game (MFG), which uses market information -- reflecting the average behavior of market participants -- to enable each aggregator to predict long-term LMP trends and make informed decisions. For each aggregator, because they control the DERs within their portfolio under certain contract structures, we employ a mean-field control (MFC) approach (as opposed to a MFG) to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the total rewards of the DERs under their management. We also propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to help each agent learn optimal strategies within the MFG framework, enhancing their ability to adapt to market conditions and uncertainties. Numerical simulations show that LMPs quickly reach a steady state in the hybrid mean-field approach. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the combination of energy storage and mean-field learning significantly reduces price volatility compared to scenarios without storage.</p>

            <h2>CT-Mamba: A Hybrid Convolutional State Space Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linxuan Li, Wenjia Wei, Luyao Yang, Wenwen Zhang, Jiashu Dong, Yahua Liu, Hongshi Huang, Wei Zhao</p>
            <p>Low-dose CT (LDCT) significantly reduces the radiation dose received by patients, however, dose reduction introduces additional noise and artifacts. Currently, denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) face limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, while Transformer-based denoising methods, although capable of powerful long-range modeling, suffer from high computational complexity. Furthermore, the denoised images predicted by deep learning-based techniques inevitably exhibit differences in noise distribution compared to normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which can also impact the final image quality and diagnostic outcomes. This paper proposes CT-Mamba, a hybrid convolutional State Space Model for LDCT image denoising. The model combines the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs with Mamba's strength in capturing long-range dependencies, enabling it to capture both local details and global context. Additionally, we introduce an innovative spatially coherent Z-shaped scanning scheme to ensure spatial continuity between adjacent pixels in the image. We design a Mamba-driven deep noise power spectrum (NPS) loss function to guide model training, ensuring that the noise texture of the denoised LDCT images closely resembles that of NDCT images, thereby enhancing overall image quality and diagnostic value. Experimental results have demonstrated that CT-Mamba performs excellently in reducing noise in LDCT images, enhancing detail preservation, and optimizing noise texture distribution, and exhibits higher statistical similarity with the radiomics features of NDCT images. The proposed CT-Mamba demonstrates outstanding performance in LDCT denoising and holds promise as a representative approach for applying the Mamba framework to LDCT denoising tasks.</p>

            <h2>Liquid Lens-Based Imaging Receiver for MIMO VLC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kapila W. S. Palitharathna, Christodoulos Skouroumounis, Ioannis Krikidis</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider a tunable liquid convex lens-assisted imaging receiver for indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) systems. In contrast to existing MIMO VLC receivers that rely on fixed optical lenses, the proposed receiver leverages the additional degrees of freedom offered by liquid lenses via adjusting both focal length and orientation angles of the lens. This capability facilitates the mitigation of spatial correlation between the channel gains, thereby enhancing the overall signal quality and leading to improved bit-error rate (BER) performance. We present an accurate channel model for the liquid lens-assisted VLC system by using three-dimensional geometry and geometric optics. To achieve optimal performance under practical conditions such as random receiver orientation and user mobility, optimization of both focal length and orientation angles of the lens are required. To this end, driven by the fact that channel models are mathematically complex, we present two optimization schemes including a blockwise machine learning (ML) architecture that includes convolution layers to extract spatial features from the received signal, long-short term memory layers to predict the user position and orientation, and fully connected layers to estimate the optimal lens parameters. Numerical results are presented to compare the performance of each scheme with conventional receivers. Results show that a significant BER improvement is achieved when liquid lenses and presented ML-based optimization approaches are used. Specifically, the BER can be improved from $6\times 10^{-2}$ to $1.4\times 10^{-3}$ at an average signal-to-noise ratio of $30$ dB.</p>

            <h2>Inference and Learning of Nonlinear LFR State-Space Models</h2>

            <p>Estimating the parameters of nonlinear block-oriented state-space models from input-output data typically involves solving a highly non-convex optimization problem, which is prone to poor local minima and slow convergence. This paper presents a computationally efficient initialization method for nonlinear linear fractional representation (NL-LFR) models using periodic data. By first inferring the latent signals and subsequently estimating the model parameters, the approach generates initial estimates for use in a later nonlinear optimization step. The proposed method shows robustness against poor local minima, and achieves a twofold error reduction compared to the state-of-the-art on a challenging benchmark dataset.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Power Flow Estimation with Topology-Aware Gated Graph Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrenik Jadhav, Birva Sevak, Srijita Das, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui</p>
            <p>Accurate and scalable surrogate models for AC power flow are essential for real-time grid monitoring, contingency analysis, and decision support in increasingly dynamic and inverter-dominated power systems. However, most existing surrogates fall short of practical deployment due to their limited capacity to capture long-range nonlinear dependencies in meshed transmission networks and their weak enforcement of physical laws. These models often require extensive hyperparameter tuning, exhibit poor generalization under topology changes or large load swings, and typically do not quantify uncertainty or scale well beyond a few hundred buses. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a \textit{gated graph neural network (GGNN)} surrogate for AC power-flow estimation under topological uncertainty. The model is trained across multiple IEEE benchmark networks of varying size and complexity, each incorporating randomized line contingencies and up to 40\% load variation. To improve robustness and generalization, we explore both conventional supervised learning and physics-informed self-supervised training strategies. Comparative evaluations show that the proposed GGNN consistently outperforms prior GNN-based surrogates, achieving predictions closely aligned with Newton--Raphson solutions. By embedding operational constraints directly into the architecture and loss function, the model ensures physical consistency and delivers a lightweight, accurate, and scalable tool for real-time grid operations.</p>

            <h2>Optimality Loss Minimization in Distributed Control with Application to District Heating</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Audrey Blizard, Stephanie Stockar</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel partitioning method designed to minimize control performance degradation resulting from partitioning a system for distributed control while maintaining the computational benefits of these methods. A game-theoretic performance metric, the modified Price of Anarchy, is introduced and is used in a generalizable partitioning metric to quantify optimality losses in a distributed controller. By finding the partition that minimizes the partitioning metric, the best-performing distributed control design is chosen. The presented partitioning metric is control-design agnostic, making it broadly applicable to many control design problems. In this paper, the developed metric is used to minimize the performance losses in the distributed control of a demand-flexible District Heating Network. The final distributed controller is provably feasible and stable. In simulation, this novel partitioning performed similarly to the centralized controller, increasing overall heat losses by only 1.9%, as compared to a similarly-sized baseline partition, which resulted in a 22% increase in losses.</p>

            <p>Grid-connected inverter control is challenging to implement due to the difficulty of obtaining and maintaining an accurate grid model. Direct Data-Driven Predictive Control provides a model-free alternative to traditional model-based control methods. This paper describes how the recently-proposed Transient Predictive Control (TPC) can be used for real-world, plug-and-play inverter control. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) The TPC algorithm can be run online using standard hardware, and 2) TPC, which is derived using Linear Time-Invariant assumptions, is effective for grid-connected inverter control, which is a nonlinear and time-varying system. Experiments conducted on a two-converter benchtop setup and at the CoSES Laboratory on a 25 kVA converter connected to the Munich grid support these hypotheses.</p>

            <h2>Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Adaptive State-Feedback Control for Inter-Area Oscillation Damping with Continuous Eigenvalue Configurations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Liang, Long Huo, Wenyu Qin, Xin Chen, Peiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Controlling inter-area oscillation (IAO) across wide areas is crucial for the stability of modern power systems. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the extensive deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and generator sensors, have catalyzed the development of data-driven IAO damping controllers. In this paper, a novel IAO damping control framework is presented by modeling the control problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solving it through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The DRL-based controller is trained in the state space with continuous eigenvalue configurations. To optimize control performance and cost-efficiency, only a subset of generators, identified by global participation factors, are selected for control. In addition, a switching control strategy (SCS) is introduced that effectively integrates the DRL-based controller with power system stabilizers (PSSs) to enhance overall performance. The simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus New England power system show that the proposed method outperforms two benchmark methods regarding the transient response. The DRL-based controller trained on the linear state-space environment can be directly tested in the nonlinear differential-algebraic environment. The robustness of the proposed method against communication delays has been thoroughly investigated.</p>

            <h2>Online Convex Optimization for Coordinated Long-Term and Short-Term Isolated Microgrid Dispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Yousuf Baker, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel non-anticipatory long-short-term coordinated dispatch framework for isolated microgrid with hybrid short-long-duration energy storages (LDES). We introduce a convex hull approximation model for nonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational tractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and long-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we employ kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an adaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking and expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size optimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies achieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression scenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking, and achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These benefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates resilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults.</p>

            <h2>RIS-Aided Cooperative ISAC Networks for Structural Health Monitoring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Xiao Li, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring, and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference, measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time, incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors), optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements. Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.</p>

            <h2>Utilizing 5G NR SSB Blocks for Passive Detection and Localization of Low-Altitude Drones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Palatip Jopanya, Diana P. M. Osorio</p>
            <p>With the exponential growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry and a broad range of applications expected to appear in the coming years, the employment of traditional radar systems is becoming increasingly cumbersome for UAV supervision. Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this task. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block (SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive bistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according to the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of orthogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing toward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and velocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB signals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Quantized Federated Learning with Diverse Precision</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dang Qua Nguyen, Morteza Hashemi, Erik Perrins, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC) and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task. In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.</p>

This paper describes how the recently-proposed Transient Predictive Control (TPC) can be used for real-world, plug-and-play inverter control. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) The TPC algorithm can be run online using standard hardware, and 2) TPC, which is derived using Linear Time-Invariant assumptions, is effective for grid-connected inverter control, which is a nonlinear and time-varying system. Experiments conducted on a two-converter benchtop setup and at the CoSES Laboratory on a 25 kVA converter connected to the Munich grid support these hypotheses.</p>

            <h2>Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based Adaptive State-Feedback Control for Inter-Area Oscillation Damping with Continuous Eigenvalue Configurations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Liang, Long Huo, Wenyu Qin, Xin Chen, Peiyuan Sun</p>
            <p>Controlling inter-area oscillation (IAO) across wide areas is crucial for the stability of modern power systems. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the extensive deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and generator sensors, have catalyzed the development of data-driven IAO damping controllers. In this paper, a novel IAO damping control framework is presented by modeling the control problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solving it through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The DRL-based controller is trained in the state space with continuous eigenvalue configurations. To optimize control performance and cost-efficiency, only a subset of generators, identified by global participation factors, are selected for control. In addition, a switching control strategy (SCS) is introduced that effectively integrates the DRL-based controller with power system stabilizers (PSSs) to enhance overall performance. The simulation results on the IEEE 39-bus New England power system show that the proposed method outperforms two benchmark methods regarding the transient response. The DRL-based controller trained on the linear state-space environment can be directly tested in the nonlinear differential-algebraic environment. The robustness of the proposed method against communication delays has been thoroughly investigated.</p>

            <h2>Online Convex Optimization for Coordinated Long-Term and Short-Term Isolated Microgrid Dispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning Qi, Yousuf Baker, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel non-anticipatory long-short-term coordinated dispatch framework for isolated microgrid with hybrid short-long-duration energy storages (LDES). We introduce a convex hull approximation model for nonconvex LDES electrochemical dynamics, facilitating computational tractability and accuracy. To address temporal coupling in SoC dynamics and long-term contracts, we generate hindsight-optimal state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of LDES and netloads for offline training. In the online stage, we employ kernel regression to dynamically update the SoC reference and propose an adaptive online convex optimization (OCO) algorithm with SoC reference tracking and expert tracking to mitigate myopia and enable adaptive step-size optimization. We rigorously prove that both long-term and short-term policies achieve sublinear regret bounds over time, which improves with more regression scenarios, stronger tracking penalties, and finer convex approximations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing costs by 73.4%, eliminating load loss via reference tracking, and achieving an additional 2.4% cost saving via the OCO algorithm. These benefits scale up with longer LDES durations, and the method demonstrates resilience to poor forecasts and unexpected system faults.</p>

            <h2>RIS-Aided Cooperative ISAC Networks for Structural Health Monitoring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Xiao Li, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring, and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference, measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time, incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors), optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements. Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.</p>

            <h2>Utilizing 5G NR SSB Blocks for Passive Detection and Localization of Low-Altitude Drones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Palatip Jopanya, Diana P. M. Osorio</p>
            <p>With the exponential growth of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) industry and a broad range of applications expected to appear in the coming years, the employment of traditional radar systems is becoming increasingly cumbersome for UAV supervision. Motivated by this emerging challenge, this paper investigates the feasibility of employing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems implemented over current and future wireless networks to perform this task. We propose a sensing mechanism based on the synchronization signal block (SSB) in the fifth-generation (5G) standard that performs sensing in a passive bistatic setting. By assuming planar arrays at the sensing nodes and according to the 5G standard, we consider that the SSB signal is sent in a grid of orthogonal beams that are multiplexed in time, with some of them pointing toward a surveillance region where low-altitude drones can be flying. The Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) is derived as the theoretical bound for range and velocity estimation. Our results demonstrate the potential of employing SSB signals for UAV-like target localization at low SNR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dang Qua Nguyen, Morteza Hashemi, Erik Perrins, Sergiy A. Vorobyov, David J. Love, Taejoon Kim</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC) and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task. In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.</p>

            <h2>An Adaptive Estimation Approach based on Fisher Information to Overcome the Challenges of LFP Battery SOC Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junzhe Shi, Shida Jiang, Shengyu Tao, Jaewong Lee, Manashita Borah, Scott Moura</p>
            <p>Robust and Real-time State of Charge (SOC) estimation is essential for Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems due to safety and longevity. However, the flat Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)-SOC curve makes this task particularly challenging. This challenge is complicated by hysteresis effects, and real-world conditions such as current bias, voltage quantization errors, and temperature that must be considered in the battery management system use. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive estimation approach to overcome the challenges of LFPSOC estimation. Specifically, the method uses an adaptive fisher information fusion strategy that adaptively combines the SOC estimation from two different models, which are Coulomb counting and equivalent circuit model-based parameter identification. The effectiveness of this strategy is rationalized by the information richness excited by external cycling signals. A 3D OCV-H-SOC map that captures the relationship between OCV, hysteresis, and SOC was proposed as the backbone, and can be generalizable to other widely adopted parameter-identification methods. Extensive validation under ideal and real-world use scenarios, including SOC-OCV flat zones, current bias, voltage quantization errors, low temperatures, and insufficient current excitations, have been performed using 4 driving profiles, i.e., the Orange County Transit Bus Cycle, the California Unified Cycle, the US06 Drive Cycle, and the New York City Cycle, where the results demonstrate superiority over the state-of-the-art unscented Kalman filter, long short-term memory networks and transformer in all validation cases.</p>

            <h2>Synchronising DER inverters to weak grid using Kalman filter and LQR current controller</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Phuoc Sang Nguyen, Ghavameddin Nourbakhsh, Gerard Ledwich</p>
            <p>Grid-following (GFL) inverters are commonly used for integrating renewable energy sources into power grids. However, the dynamic performance of GFL models can be significantly impacted by the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in a weak grid, leading to instability due to inaccuracies in grid source phase angle estimation. The proposed method in this manuscript replaces the PLL with an Advanced Angle Estimation based Kalman Filter including a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller of the GFL. This method is robust in incorporating grid impedance terms as part of state space models in the Kalman Filter approach to estimate instantaneous phase angle using {\alpha}-\b{eta} Synchronous Reference Frame equations. The stability performance of the proposed approach is validated through eigenvalue analysis in a two-source case. Additionally, an LQR controller is employed to regulate capacitor voltage, inverter current, and the current at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). The proposed controller surpasses existing approaches in terms of accuracy and distortion reduction under abrupt grid impedance increases. Moreover, drop compensation is integrated into the Kalman Filter to enhance robustness of the inverter against external oscillation disturbances from a synchronous machine connected to the GFL via the PCC. The results in this paper demonstrate substantial improvement in oscillation damping across a range of frequencies compared with published research works.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyang Tang, Wen-Hua Chen, Cunjia Liu</p>
            <p>This paper presents an auto-optimization control framework for wave energy converters (WECs) to maximize energy generation under unknown and changing ocean conditions. The proposed control framework consists of two levels. The high-level controller operating at a longer time scale aims to maximize the average energy generation over several wave periods. The generated Power Take-Off (PTO) profile as the reference for the low-level physical system to follow. The new auto-optimization process leverages the parameterization of the non-stationary operation condition in WECs, establishing the relationship between the average energy generation and the key design parameters of the PTO force subject to the unknown wave parameters. The high-level controller is designed based on the concept of Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE) to quickly learn the unknown wave parameters by actively probing the ocean condition, while generating the optimal PTO profile. During this process, the uncertainty of the estimated wave condition is quantified and embedded in the optimization cost function to enable active learning. Simulation results under unknown regular and irregular waves demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of this novel auto-optimization WEC systems with active learning, outperforming model predictive control, extremum seeking and classic Bang-Bang control approaches.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into power systems requires the deployment of grid-forming inverters to ensure a stable operation. Accurate modeling of these devices is necessary. In this paper, a system identification approach to obtain low-dimensional models of grid-forming inverters is presented. The proposed approach is based on a Hammerstein-Wiener parametrization of the normal-form model. The normal-form is a gray-box model that utilizes complex frequency and phase to capture non-linear inverter dynamics. The model is validated on two well-known control strategies: droop-control and dispatchable virtual oscillators. Simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the normal-form accurately models inverter dynamics across various operating conditions. The approach shows great potential for enhancing the modeling of RES-dominated power systems, especially when component models are unavailable or computationally expensive.</p>

            <p>Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Niehues, Robin Delabays, Anna Büttner, Frank Hellmann</p>
            <p>The stability of inverter-dominated power grids remains an active area of research. This paper presents novel sufficient conditions for ensuring small-signal stability in lossless and constant $R/X$ grids with highly heterogeneous mixes of grid-forming inverters that implement an adapted $V$-$q$ droop control. The proposed conditions can be evaluated in the neighborhood of each bus without information on the rest of the grid. Apart from the presence of $V$-$q$ droop, no additional assumptions are made regarding the inverter control strategies, nor is dynamical homogeneity across the system assumed. The analysis is enabled by recasting the node dynamics in terms of complex frequency and power, resulting in transfer functions that directly capture the small-signal frequency and amplitude responses to active and reactive power imbalances. These transfer functions are directly aligned with typical design considerations in grid-forming control. Building on an adapted small-phase theorem and viewing the system as a closed feedback loop between nodes and lines, the derived stability conditions also yield new insights when applied to established inverter control designs. We demonstrate in simulations that our conditions are not overly conservative and can identify individual inverters that are misconfigured and cause instability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyi Zhou, Christoph Graf, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative (worst-case) assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and stability selection, respectively.</p>

            <p>The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel method for identifying Thévenin equivalent parameters (TEP) in power system, based on the statistical characteristics of the system's stochastic response. The method leverages stochastic fluctuation data under steady-state grid conditions and applies sliding window techniques to compute sensitivity parameters between voltage magnitude, current magnitude and power. This enables high-accuracy and robust TEP identification. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on large disturbances or probing signals but instead utilizes the natural fluctuation behavior of the system. Additionally, the method supports distributed implementation using local measurements of voltage magnitude, current magnitude, and power, offering significant practical value for engineering applications. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the method's robustness in the presence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), asynchronous measurements, and data collinearity issues. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in diverse practical scenarios, demonstrating its ability to consistently provide accurate and reliable identification of TEP using system ambient data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxi Tang, Li Peng, Xuefeng Wang, Xinchen Yao</p>
            <p>Voltage regulation under conventional grid-forming controllers is tightly coupled to power sharing and dc-link dynamics. Consequently, its tracking accuracy deteriorates during grid faults, sudden power sharing changes, or dc-bus voltage varying. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC) method is developed and its voltage precision region is derived. It illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when an abnormal entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by this insight, an asymmetry compensation structure is proposed, which avoids added design complexity and directly mitigates voltage tracking error. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses while maintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode controllers, which handle these variations separately, cannot match this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage precision region is explicitly verified.</p>

In this paper, we investigate a promising base station (BS) architecture that integrates a beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) within the BS to enable passive beamforming. By utilizing Takagi's decomposition and leveraging the effective beamforming vector, the RIS profile can be designed to enable passive beamforming directed toward the target. Through the beamforming analysis, we reveal that BD-RIS provides robust beamforming performance across various system configurations, whereas the traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) exhibits instability with increasing RIS size and decreasing BS-RIS separation-two critical factors in optimizing RIS-assisted systems. Comprehensive computer simulation results across various aspects validate the superiority of the proposed BS-integrated BD-RIS over conventional D-RIS architectures, showcasing performance comparable to active analog beamforming antenna arrays.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kesav Kaza, Ramachandran Anantharaman, Rahul Meshram</p>
            <p>This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.</p>

            <h2>Unsupervised Learning-Based Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design for RIS-Assisted MISO-OFDMA Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Ma, Xingyu Zhou, Xiao Li, Le Liang, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Energy Management Strategies for Community Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moslem Uddin, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong</p>
            <p>This study presents a real-time energy management framework for hybrid community microgrids integrating photovoltaic, wind, battery energy storage systems, diesel generators, and grid interconnection. The proposed approach formulates the dispatch problem as a multi-objective optimization task that aims to minimize operational costs. Two control strategies are proposed and evaluated: a conventional rule-based control (RBC) method and an advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach utilizing proximal policy optimization (PPO). A realistic case study based on Australian load and generation profiles is used to validate the framework. Simulation results demonstrate that DRL-PPO reduces operational costs by 18%, CO_2 emissions by 20%, and improves system reliability by 87.5% compared to RBC. Beside, DRL-PPO increases renewable energy utilization by 13%, effectively reducing dependence on diesel generation and grid imports. These findings demonstrate the potential of DRL-based approaches to enable cost-effective and resilient microgrid operations, particularly in regional and remote communities.</p>

            <h2>Power Flow Analysis of a 5-Bus Power System Based on Newton-Raphson Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sampson E. Nwachukwu</p>
            <p>Load flow analysis is a fundamental technique used by electrical engineers to simulate and evaluate power system behavior under steady-state conditions. It enables efficient operation and control by determining how active and reactive power flows throughout the system. Selecting an appropriate solution method is critical to ensuring reliable and economical operation of power generation, transmission, and distribution networks. While the conventional loop method may be used in small-scale systems, it is limited by its reliance on impedance-based load data and its inability to scale to complex networks. In contrast, iterative techniques such as the Gauss-Seidel (GS) and Newton-Raphson (NR) methods are better suited for analyzing large systems. Of these, the NR method offers significant advantages due to its quadratic convergence and improved numerical stability. This study presents a power flow analysis of a 5-bus system using the Newton-Raphson approach. The system was modeled and simulated in PowerWorld Simulator (PWS), and a custom MATLAB implementation was developed to verify the results under a base case scenario. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the NR method provides accurate and robust solutions for power flow problems, making it well-suited for evaluating system performance under various operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>Power-Gas Infrastructure Planning under Weather-induced Supply and Demand Uncertainties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahman Khorramfar, Dharik Mallapragada, Saurabh Amin</p>
            <p>Implementing economy-wide decarbonization strategies based on decarbonizing the power grid via variable renewable energy (VRE) expansion and electrification of end-uses requires new approaches for energy infrastructure planning that consider, among other factors, weather-induced uncertainty in demand and VRE supply. An energy planning model that fails to account for these uncertainties can hinder the intended transition efforts to a low-carbon grid and increase the risk of supply shortage especially during extreme weather conditions. Here, we consider the generation and transmission expansion problem of joint power-gas infrastructure and operations planning under the uncertainty of both demand and renewable supply. We propose two distributionally robust optimization approaches based on moment (MDRO) and Wasserstein distance (WDRO) ambiguity sets to endogenize these uncertainties and account for the change in the underlying distribution of these parameters that is caused by the climate change, among other factors. Furthermore, our model considers the risk-aversion of the energy planners in the modeling framework via the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) metric. An equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation of both modeling frameworks is presented, and a computationally efficient approximation scheme to obtain near-optimal solutions is proposed. We demonstrate the resulting DRO planning models and solution strategy via a New England case study under different levels of end-use electrification and decarbonization targets. Our experiments systematically explore different modeling aspects and compare the DRO models with stochastic programming (SP) results.</p>

            <h2>Reliability Assessment of Power System Based on the Dichotomy Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjie Wan, Han Hu, Feiyu Chen, Xiaoyu Liu, Kequan Zhao</p>
            <p>With a sustainable increase in the scale of power system, the number of states in the state space grows exponentially, and the reliability assessment of the power system faces enormous challenges. Traditional state-by-state assessment methods, such as state enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods, have encountered performance bottlenecks in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, the Boolean lattice representation theory of the state space was studied, and a dichotomy method was proposed to efficiently partition the state space into some disjoint sub-lattices with a relatively small number of optimal power flow (OPF) operations. Based on lattice partition, the reliability indices of the entire space can be calculated lattice-by-lattice. In addition, alone with the partitioning procedure, the calculated loss of load probability (LOLP) monotonically increases and rapidly tends to the analytic value with the designated error bound. Moreover, we designed a customized Monte Carlo sampling method in lattices of interest to compute expected energy not supply (EENS). The experiments are conducted on the RBTS and RTS-79 systems. The results show that the proposed method achieves the analytic LOLP of the RBTS system after five hundreds of OPF operations, which is about hundreds of times faster than traditional methods, and the designed Monte Carlo sampling method converged after thousands of OPF operations on test systems.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Aware Model Predictive Control for Batch Manufacturing System Scheduling Under Different Electricity Pricing Strategies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongliang Li, Herschel C. Pangborn, Ilya Kovalenko</p>
            <p>Manufacturing industries are among the highest energy-consuming sectors, facing increasing pressure to reduce energy costs. This paper presents an energy-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to dynamically schedule manufacturing processes in response to time-varying electricity prices without compromising production goals or violating production constraints. A network-based manufacturing system model is developed to capture complex material flows, batch processing, and capacities of buffers and machines. The scheduling problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that balances energy costs, buffer levels, and production requirements. A case study evaluates the proposed MPC framework under four industrial electricity pricing schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the approach reduces energy usage expenses while satisfying production goals and adhering to production constraints. The findings highlight the importance of considering the detailed electricity cost structure in manufacturing scheduling decisions and provide practical insights for manufacturers when selecting among different electricity pricing strategies.</p>

            <h2>A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Control in Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Salaorni, Federico Bianchi, Francesco Trovò, Marcello Restelli</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) is transforming traditional power grid networks, which require new approaches for managing decentralized energy production and consumption. Microgrids (MGs) provide a promising solution by enabling localized control over energy generation, storage, and distribution. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based methodology for optimizing microgrid energy management. Specifically, we propose an RL agent that learns optimal energy trading and storage policies by leveraging historical data on energy production, consumption, and market prices. A digital twin (DT) is used to simulate the energy storage system dynamics, incorporating degradation factors to ensure a realistic emulation of the analysed setting. Our approach is validated through an experimental campaign using real-world data from a power grid located in the Italian territory. The results indicate that the proposed RL-based strategy outperforms rule-based methods and existing RL benchmarks, offering a robust solution for intelligent microgrid management.</p>

Delimited to two-handed piano pieces, it was built to consider not only certain graphic similarity but also composition patterns, as this creative process is highly instrument-dependent. It provides two scenarios in relation to composer and composition type. The first, formed by 14k samples, considers works from different authors but the same composition type, specifically, Sonatinas. The latter, consisting of 10.8K samples, presents the opposite case, various composition types from the same author, being the one selected Franz Liszt. All of the 24.8k samples are formatted as grayscale jpg images of $128 \times 512$ pixels. VisionScores supplies the users not only the formatted samples but the systems' order and pieces' metadata.

            <p>This paper explores Reinforcement learning (RL) policy robustness by systematically analyzing network parameters under internal and external stresses. Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.</p>

            <h2>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Enhancing Multi-Target Wireless Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Teng, Jiancheng An, Lu Gan, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Zhu Han</p>
            <p>Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) has emerged as a transformative technology to enhance wireless sensing by dynamically morphing its three-dimensional (3D) surface shape and electromagnetic response. Unlike conventional rigid arrays, an FIM consists of low-cost radiating elements that can independently adjust their positions and radiation characteristics, thereby allowing for real-time optimization of the sensing environment. This paper investigates the impact of FIM on wireless sensing performance. Specifically, we focus on the maximization of the cumulated power of the probing signals at the target locations under the per-antenna power constraint by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the surface shape of the transmitting FIM. We propose a block coordinate descend (BCD) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution, by alternatively updating the FIM surface shape and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other one fixed at each step. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that FIM enhances wireless sensing by providing a new design degree-of-freedom to coordinate the correlation between steering vectors at different angles. Numerical results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves wireless sensing performance under the considered multi-target scenario.</p>

            <p>Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i) Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future brain-AI research.</p>

            <p>Accurate residential load forecasting is critical for power system reliability with rising renewable integration and demand-side flexibility. However, most statistical and machine learning models treat external factors, such as weather, calendar effects, and pricing, as extra input, ignoring their heterogeneity, and thus limiting the extraction of useful external information. We propose a paradigm shift: external data should serve as meta-knowledge to dynamically adapt the forecasting model itself. Based on this idea, we design a meta-representation framework using hypernetworks that modulate selected parameters of a base Deep Learning (DL) model in response to external conditions. This provides both expressivity and adaptability. We further integrate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to enhance efficiency through selective expert activation, while improving robustness by filtering redundant external inputs. The resulting model, dubbed as a Meta Mixture of Experts for External data (M2oE2), achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness with limited additional overhead, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse load datasets.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Fortunati, Jean-Pierre Delmas, Esa Ollila</p>
            <p>Elliptically symmetric distributions are a classic example of a semiparametric model where the location vector and the scatter matrix (or a parameterization of them) are the two finite-dimensional parameters of interest, while the density generator represents an \textit{infinite-dimensional nuisance} term. This basic representation of the elliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering additional \textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is therefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between statistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence of both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous works that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our approach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such as projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space. This allows us to obtain original results also for the case where the location vector and the scatter matrix are parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector that can be partitioned in two sub-vectors: one containing the parameters of interest and the other containing the nuisance parameters. As an example, we illustrate how the obtained results can be applied to the well-known \virg{low-rank} parameterization. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis will be developed for Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES) distributions, we show how to extend our results to the case of Circular and Non-Circular Complex Elliptically Symmetric (C-CES and NC-CES) distributions.</p>

            <p>Diffusion-model-based image super-resolution techniques often face a trade-off between realistic image generation and computational efficiency. This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Huang, Ming Zhao, Shengli Zhou, Ling Qiu, Jinkang Zhu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel downlink multiple access system with a multi-antenna transmitter and two single-antenna receivers, inspired by the underlying principles of hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (H-QAM) based multiple access (QAMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). In the proposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared symbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint symbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the transmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray mapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition to avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently demodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based on closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that of orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other competing alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We carry out system optimization and determine the achievable rate region. Numerical results show that the proposed system has a larger rate region relative to other benchmark schemes with receivers not using SIC, and even achieves a comparable rate region to those benchmark schemes with SIC receivers.</p>

            <p>Speech codecs serve as bridges between speech signals and large language models. An ideal codec for speech language models should not only preserve acoustic information but also capture rich semantic information. However, existing speech codecs struggle to balance high-quality audio reconstruction with ease of modeling by language models. In this study, we analyze the limitations of previous codecs in balancing semantic richness and acoustic fidelity. We propose XY-Tokenizer, a novel codec that mitigates the conflict between semantic and acoustic capabilities through multi-stage, multi-task learning. Experimental results demonstrate that XY-Tokenizer achieves performance in both semantic and acoustic tasks comparable to that of state-of-the-art codecs operating at similar bitrates, even though those existing codecs typically excel in only one aspect. Specifically, XY-Tokenizer achieves strong text alignment, surpassing distillation-based semantic modeling methods such as SpeechTokenizer and Mimi, while maintaining a speaker similarity score of 0.83 between reconstructed and original audio. The reconstruction performance of XY-Tokenizer is comparable to that of BigCodec, the current state-of-the-art among acoustic-only codecs, which achieves a speaker similarity score of 0.84 at a similar bitrate.

Our framework guarantees recursive feasibility for the MPC controller, and it is scalable to high-dimensional systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with two simulation studies using a 4D Dubins Car and a 6 Dof Kuka iiwa manipulator, and the experiments show that our framework significantly improves the safety constraints satisfaction of the systems over the baselines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Chai, Xiaodong Guo, Tong Liu</p>
            <p>Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light. However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p>We present the first text-to-speech (TTS) system tailored to second language (L2) speakers. We use duration differences between American English tense (longer) and lax (shorter) vowels to create a "clarity mode" for Matcha-TTS. Our perception studies showed that French-L1, English-L2 listeners had fewer (at least 9.15%) transcription errors when using our clarity mode, and found it more encouraging and respectful than overall slowed down speech. Remarkably, listeners were not aware of these effects: despite the decreased word error rate in clarity mode, listeners still believed that slowing all target words was the most intelligible, suggesting that actual intelligibility does not correlate with perceived intelligibility. Additionally, we found that Whisper-ASR did not use the same cues as L2 speakers to differentiate difficult vowels and is not sufficient to assess the intelligibility of TTS systems for these individuals.</p>

            <h2>A Model Predictive Control Framework to Enhance Safety and Quality in Mobile Additive Manufacturing Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifei Li, Joshua A. Robbins, Guha Manogharan, Herschel C. Pangborn, Ilya Kovalenko</p>
            <p>In recent years, the demand for customized, on-demand production has grown in the manufacturing sector. Additive Manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance customization capabilities, enabling greater flexibility, reduced lead times, and more efficient material usage. However, traditional AM systems remain constrained by static setups and human worker dependencies, resulting in long lead times and limited scalability. Mobile robots can improve the flexibility of production systems by transporting products to designated locations in a dynamic environment. By integrating AM systems with mobile robots, manufacturers can optimize travel time for preparatory tasks and distributed printing operations. Mobile AM robots have been deployed for on-site production of large-scale structures, but often neglect critical print quality metrics like surface roughness. Additionally, these systems do not have the precision necessary for producing small, intricate components. We propose a model predictive control framework for a mobile AM platform that ensures safe navigation on the plant floor while maintaining high print quality in a dynamic environment. Three case studies are used to test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed systems.</p>

            <h2>From Large-scale Audio Tagging to Real-Time Explainable Emergency Vehicle Sirens Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Giacomelli, Marco Giordano, Claudia Rinaldi, Fabio Graziosi</p>
            <p>Accurate recognition of Emergency Vehicle (EV) sirens is critical for the integration of intelligent transportation systems, smart city monitoring systems, and autonomous driving technologies. Modern automatic solutions are limited by the lack of large scale, curated datasets and by the computational demands of state of the art sound event detection models. This work introduces E2PANNs (Efficient Emergency Pre trained Audio Neural Networks), a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network architecture derived from the PANNs framework, specifically optimized for binary EV siren detection. Leveraging our dedicated subset of AudioSet (AudioSet EV) we fine-tune and evaluate E2PANNs across multiple reference datasets and test its viability on embedded hardware. The experimental campaign includes ablation studies, cross-domain benchmarking, and real-time inference deployment on edge device. Interpretability analyses exploiting Guided Backpropagation and ScoreCAM algorithms provide insights into the model internal representations and validate its ability to capture distinct spectrotemporal patterns associated with different types of EV sirens. Real time performance is assessed through frame wise and event based detection metrics, as well as a detailed analysis of false positive activations. Results demonstrate that E2PANNs establish a new state of the art in this research domain, with high computational efficiency, and suitability for edge-based audio monitoring and safety-critical applications.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation of Geolocation Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models and Analysis of Associated Privacy Risks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Zhang, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>Objectives: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, enabling a wide range of intelligent applications. However, these advancements also raise critical concerns regarding privacy and ethics. MLLMs are now capable of inferring the geographic location of images -- such as those shared on social media or captured from street views -- based solely on visual content, thereby posing serious risks of privacy invasion, including doxxing, surveillance, and other security threats. Methods: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of existing geolocation techniques based on MLLMs. It systematically reviews relevant litera-ture and evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art visual reasoning models on geolocation tasks, particularly in identifying the origins of street view imagery. Results: Empirical evaluation reveals that the most advanced visual large models can successfully localize the origin of street-level imagery with up to $49\%$ accuracy within a 1-kilometer radius. This performance underscores the models' powerful capacity to extract and utilize fine-grained geographic cues from visual data. Conclusions: Building on these findings, the study identifies key visual elements that contribute to suc-cessful geolocation, such as text, architectural styles, and environmental features. Furthermore, it discusses the potential privacy implications associated with MLLM-enabled geolocation and discuss several technical and policy-based coun-termeasures to mitigate associated risks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhuo Chen, Zehua Ma, Han Fang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu</p>
            <p>AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention. However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process, necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks. To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.</p>

            <p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have garnered significant attention in the forthcoming 6G networks. In LAWNs, satellites with wide coverage and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility can complement each other to form integrated satellite-UAV networks, providing ubiquitous and high-speed connectivity for low-altitude operations. However, the higher line-of-sight probability in low-altitude airspace increases transmission security concerns. In this work, we present a collaborative beamforming-based physical layer security scheme for LAWNs. We introduce the fundamental aspects of integrated satellite-UAV networks, physical layer security, UAV swarms, and collaborative beamforming for LAWN applications. Following this, we highlight several opportunities for collaborative UAV swarm secure applications enabled by satellite networks, including achieving physical layer security in scenarios involving data dissemination, data relay, eavesdropper collusion, and imperfect eavesdropper information. Next, we detail two case studies: a secure relay system and a two-way aerial secure communication framework specifically designed for LAWN environments. Simulation results demonstrate that these physical layer security schemes are effective and beneficial for secure low-altitude wireless communications. A short practicality analysis shows that the proposed method is applicable to LAWN scenarios. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions for enhancing security in LAWNs.</p>

            <p>The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths. Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model. JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page: this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shakir Showkat Sofi, Charlotte Vermeylen, Lieven De Lathauwer</p>
            <p>Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengjun Liu, Yijun Xu, Wei Gu, Bo Sun, Kai Wen, Shuai Lu, Lamine Mili</p>
            <p>The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model. Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard clustering problem.</p>

In this study, we construct RELATE, an open-sourced dataset that subjectively evaluates the relevance. Also, we benchmark a model for automatically predicting the subjective evaluation score from synthesized audio. Our model outperforms a conventional CLAPScore model, and that trend extends to many sound categories.</p>

            <p>Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shawon Mitra, Subhojit Sarkar, Sasthi C. Ghosh</p>
            <p>One primary focus of next generation wireless communication networks is the millimeterwave (mmWave) spectrum, typically considered in the 30 GHz to 300 GHz frequency range. Despite their promise of high data rates, mmWaves suffer from severe attenuation while passing through obstacles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed to offset this limitation on account of their additional degrees of freedom, which can be leveraged to provide line of sight (LoS) transmission paths. While some prior works have proposed analytical frameworks to compute the LoS probability for static ground users and a UAV, the same is lacking for mobile users on the ground. In this paper, we consider the popular Manhattan point line process (MPLP) to model an urban environment, within which a ground user moves with a known velocity for a small time interval along the roads. We derive an expression for the expected duration of LoS between a static UAV in the air and a mobile ground user, and validate the same through simulations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed analysis, we propose a simple user association algorithm that greedily assigns the UAVs to users with the highest expected LoS time, and show that it outperforms the existing benchmark schemes that assign the users to the nearest UAVs with LoS without considering the user mobility.</p>

            <p>Automated inspection with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) is a transformative capability set to revolutionize various application domains. However, this task is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception, planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately. Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics, directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.</p>

            <p>We study the capabilities of generative autoregressive transformer models trained on large amounts of symbolic solo-piano transcriptions. After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.</p>

            <p>In music information retrieval (MIR), contrastive self-supervised learning for general-purpose representation models is effective for global tasks such as automatic tagging. However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josie König, Elizabeth Qian, Melina A. Freitag</p>
            <p>Bayesian inverse problems use observed data to update a prior probability distribution for an unknown state or parameter of a scientific system to a posterior distribution conditioned on the data. In many applications, the unknown parameter is high-dimensional, making computation of the posterior expensive due to the need to sample in a high-dimensional space and the need to evaluate an expensive high-dimensional forward model relating the unknown parameter to the data. However, inverse problems often exhibit low-dimensional structure due to the fact that the available data are only informative in a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. Dimension reduction approaches exploit this structure by restricting inference to the low-dimensional subspace informed by the data, which can be sampled more efficiently. Further computational cost reductions can be achieved by replacing expensive high-dimensional forward models with cheaper lower-dimensional reduced models. In this work, we propose new dimension and model reduction approaches for linear Bayesian inverse problems with rank-deficient prior covariances, which arise in many practical inference settings. The dimension reduction approach is applicable to general linear Bayesian inverse problems whereas the model reduction approaches are specific to the problem of inferring the initial condition of a linear dynamical system. We provide theoretical approximation guarantees as well as numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approaches.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in discrete token-based speech generation have highlighted the importance of token-to-waveform generation for audio quality, particularly in real-time interactions. Traditional frameworks integrating semantic tokens with flow matching (FM) struggle with streaming capabilities due to their reliance on a global receptive field. Additionally, directly implementing token-by-token streaming speech generation often results in degraded audio quality. To address these challenges, we propose StreamFlow, a novel neural architecture that facilitates streaming flow matching with diffusion transformers (DiT). To mitigate the long-sequence extrapolation issues arising from lengthy historical dependencies, we design a local block-wise receptive field strategy. Specifically, the sequence is first segmented into blocks, and we introduce block-wise attention masks that enable the current block to receive information from the previous or subsequent block. These attention masks are combined hierarchically across different DiT-blocks to regulate the receptive field of DiTs. Both subjective and objective experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to non-streaming methods while surpassing other streaming methods in terms of speech quality, all the while effectively managing inference time during long-sequence generation. Furthermore, our method achieves a notable first-packet latency of only 180 ms.\footnote{Speech samples: this https URL}</p>

            <p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across various applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its extensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model adaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However, existing approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which overlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in the weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that leverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a multi-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the wavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA obtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution analysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while providing greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA performs superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation, classification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated image quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was primarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in language tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shengling Shi, Anastasios Tsiamis, Bart De Schutter</p>
            <p>This work analyzes how the trade-off between the modeling error, the terminal value function error, and the prediction horizon affects the performance of a nominal receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a novel performance upper bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon can be either one or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value function error. The result also shows that when an infinite horizon is desired, a finite prediction horizon that is larger than the controllability index can be sufficient for achieving a near-optimal performance, revealing a close relation between the prediction horizon and controllability. The obtained suboptimality performance upper bound is applied to provide novel sample complexity and regret guarantees for nominal receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting. We show that an adaptive prediction horizon that increases as a logarithmic function of time is beneficial for regret minimization.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian process-based moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework for unknown nonlinear systems. On the one hand, we approximate the system dynamics by the posterior means of the learned Gaussian processes (GPs). On the other hand, we exploit the posterior variances of the Gaussian processes to design the weighting matrices in the MHE cost function and account for the uncertainty in the learned system dynamics. The data collection and the tuning of the hyperparameters are done offline. We prove robust stability of the GP-based MHE scheme using a Lyapunov-based proof technique. Furthermore, as additional contribution, we derive a sufficient condition under which incremental input/output-to-state stability (a nonlinear detectability notion) is preserved when approximating the system dynamics using, e.g., machine learning techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the GP-based MHE scheme in two simulation case studies and show how the chosen weighting matrices can lead to an improved performance compared to standard cost functions.</p>

            <p>The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. The filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single Zak-OTFS point (impulse) pulsone waveform, and the I/O relation can be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. Predictability opens up the possibility of a model-free mode of operation. The time-domain realization of a Zak-OTFS point pulsone is a pulse train modulated by a tone, hence the name, pulsone. The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of a pulsone is about $15$ dB, and we describe a general method for constructing a spread pulsone for which the time-domain realization has a PAPR of about 6dB. We construct the spread pulsone by applying a type of discrete spreading filter to a Zak-OTFS point pulsone. The self-ambiguity function of the point pulsone is supported on the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, and by applying a discrete chirp filter, we obtain a spread pulsone with a self-ambiguity function that is supported on a rotated lattice ${\Lambda^*}$. We show that if the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to ${\Lambda^*}$ then the effective DD domain filter taps can simply be read off from the cross-ambiguity between the channel response to the spread pulsone and the transmitted spread pulsone. If, in addition, the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, then in an OTFS frame consisting of a spread pilot pulsone and point data pulsones, after cancelling the received signal corresponding to the spread pulsone, we can recover the channel response to any data pulsone.</p>

Given samples of a multidimensional signal of the form $$ f(\boldsymbol\ell)=\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\exp(-i\langle \boldsymbol\ell, \mathbf{w}_k\rangle), \quad \mathbf{w}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{w}_k\in\mathbb{R}^q, \ \boldsymbol\ell\in \mathbb{Z}^q, \ |\boldsymbol\ell| <n, $$ determine the values of the number $K$ of components, and the parameters $a_k$ and $\mathbf{w}_k$'s. We note that the the number of samples of $f$ in the above equation is $(2n-1)^q$. We develop an algorithm to recuperate these quantities accurately using only a subsample of size $\mathcal{O}(qn)$ of this data. For this purpose, we use a novel localized kernel method to identify the parameters, including the number $K$ of signals. Our method is easy to implement, and is shown to be stable under a very low SNR range. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting algorithm using 2 and 3 dimensional examples from the literature, and show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art techniques including Prony based, MUSIC and ESPRIT approaches.</p>

            <h2>Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with aging-aware circuit models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Zhou, Antti Aitio, David Howey</p>
            <p>Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.</p>

            <p>Pediatric central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade glioma in children is less than 20%. The development of new treatments is dependent upon multi-institutional collaborative clinical trials requiring reproducible and accurate centralized response assessment. We present the results of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, the first Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge focused on pediatric brain tumors. This challenge utilized data acquired from multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. BraTS-PEDs 2023 aimed to evaluate volumetric segmentation algorithms for pediatric brain gliomas from magnetic resonance imaging using standardized quantitative performance evaluation metrics employed across the BraTS 2023 challenges. The top-performing AI approaches for pediatric tumor analysis included ensembles of nnU-Net and Swin UNETR, Auto3DSeg, or nnU-Net with a self-supervised framework. The BraTSPEDs 2023 challenge fostered collaboration between clinicians (neuro-oncologists, neuroradiologists) and AI/imaging scientists, promoting faster data sharing and the development of automated volumetric analysis techniques. These advancements could significantly benefit clinical trials and improve the care of children with brain tumors.</p>

            <p>The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility for independent spherical positioning of two probes with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, it employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique capability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating measurements on static objects. Additionally, the installation is capable of spherical near-field antenna measurements over these wide frequency ranges.</p>

            <h2>Iterative approach to reconstructing neural disparity fields from light-field data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ligen Shi, Chang Liu, Xing Zhao, Jun Qiu</p>
            <p>This study proposes a neural disparity field (NDF) that establishes an implicit, continuous representation of scene disparity based on a neural field and an iterative approach to address the inverse problem of NDF reconstruction from light-field data. NDF enables seamless and precise characterization of disparity variations in three-dimensional scenes and can discretize disparity at any arbitrary resolution, overcoming the limitations of traditional disparity maps that are prone to sampling errors and interpolation inaccuracies. The proposed NDF network architecture utilizes hash encoding combined with multilayer perceptrons to capture detailed disparities in texture levels, thereby enhancing its ability to represent the geometric information of complex scenes. By leveraging the spatial-angular consistency inherent in light-field data, a differentiable forward model to generate a central view image from the light-field data is developed. Based on the forward model, an optimization scheme for the inverse problem of NDF reconstruction using differentiable propagation operators is established. Furthermore, an iterative solution method is adopted to reconstruct the NDF in the optimization scheme, which does not require training datasets and applies to light-field data captured by various acquisition methods. Experimental results demonstrate that high-quality NDF can be reconstructed from light-field data using the proposed method. High-resolution disparity can be effectively recovered by NDF, demonstrating its capability for the implicit, continuous representation of scene disparities.</p>

            <h2>Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Monemi, Mehdi Rasti, Arthur S. de Sena, Mohammad Amir Fallah, Matti Latva-Aho, Marco Di Renzo</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis of Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Methods in Multi-user Massive MISO</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuxiu Ma, Abla Kammoun, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri</p>
            <p>This paper presents a performance analysis of two distinct techniques for antenna selection and precoding in downlink multi-user massive multiple-input single-output systems with limited dynamic range power amplifiers. Both techniques are derived from the original formulation of the regularized-zero forcing precoder, designed as the solution to minimizing a regularized distortion. Based on this, the first technique, called the $\ell_1$-norm precoder, adopts an $\ell_1$-norm regularization term to encourage sparse solutions, thereby enabling antenna selection. The second technique, termed the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder, involves post-processing the precoder solution obtained from the first method by applying an entry-wise thresholding operation. This work conducts a precise performance analysis to compare these two techniques. The analysis leverages the Gaussian min-max theorem which is effective for examining the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems without explicit solutions. While the analysis of the $\ell_1$-norm precoder follows the conventional Gaussian min-max theorem framework, understanding the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder is more complex due to the non-linear behavior introduced by the thresholding operation. To address this complexity, we develop a novel Gaussian min-max theorem tailored to these scenarios. We provide precise asymptotic behavior analysis of the precoders, focusing on metrics such as received signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and bit error rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder can offer superior performance when the threshold parameter is carefully selected. Simulations confirm that the asymptotic results are accurate for systems equipped with hundreds of antennas at the base station, serving dozens of user terminals.</p>

            <h2>Ring Artifacts Removal Based on Implicit Neural Representation of Sinogram Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ligen Shi, Xu Jiang, YunZe Liu, Chang Liu, Ping Yang, Shifeng Guo, Xing Zhao</p>
            <p>Inconsistent responses of X-ray detector elements lead to stripe artifacts in the sinogram data, which manifest as ring artifacts in the reconstructed CT images, severely degrading image quality. This paper proposes a method for correcting stripe artifacts in the sinogram data. The proposed method leverages implicit neural representation (INR) to correct defective pixel response values using implicit continuous functions and simultaneously learns stripe features in the angular direction of the sinogram data. These two components are combined within an optimization constraint framework, achieving unsupervised iterative correction of stripe artifacts in the projection domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in removing ring artifacts while maintaining the clarity of CT images.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longchao Da, Rui Wang, Xiaojian Xu, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout, Hua Wei, Cao Xiao</p>
            <p>Medical imaging is crucial for diagnosing a patient's health condition, and accurate segmentation of these images is essential for isolating regions of interest to ensure precise diagnosis and treatment planning. Existing methods primarily rely on bounding boxes or point-based prompts, while few have explored text-related prompts, despite clinicians often describing their observations and instructions in natural language. To address this gap, we first propose a RAG-based free-form text prompt generator, that leverages the domain corpus to generate diverse and realistic descriptions. Then, we introduce FLanS, a novel medical image segmentation model that handles various free-form text prompts, including professional anatomy-informed queries, anatomy-agnostic position-driven queries, and anatomy-agnostic size-driven queries. Additionally, our model also incorporates a symmetry-aware canonicalization module to ensure consistent, accurate segmentations across varying scan orientations and reduce confusion between the anatomical position of an organ and its appearance in the scan. FLanS is trained on a large-scale dataset of over 100k medical images from 7 public datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior language understanding and segmentation precision, along with a deep comprehension of the relationship between them, outperforming SOTA baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p>

            <h2>A Global Coordinate-Free Approach to Invariant Contraction on Homogeneous Manifolds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Harapanahalli, Samuel Coogan</p>
            <p>In this work, we provide a global condition for contraction with respect to an invariant Riemannian metric on reductive homogeneous spaces. Using left-invariant frames, vector fields on the manifold are horizontally lifted to the ambient Lie group, where the Levi-Civita connection is globally characterized as a real matrix multiplication. By linearizing in these left-invariant frames, we characterize contraction using matrix measures on real square matrices, avoiding the use of local charts. Applying this global condition, we provide a necessary condition for a prescribed subset of the manifold to possibly admit a contracting system, which accounts for the underlying geometry of the invariant metric. Applied to the sphere, this condition implies that no great circle can be contained in a contraction region. Finally, we apply our results to compute reachable sets for an attitude control problem.</p>

            <p>Virtual staining of tissue offers a powerful tool for transforming label-free microscopy images of unstained tissue into equivalents of histochemically stained samples. This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</p>

            <p>Raga classification in Indian Art Music is an open-set problem where unseen classes may appear during testing. However, traditional approaches often treat it as a closed set problem, rejecting the possibility of encountering unseen classes. In this work, we try to tackle this problem by first employing an Uncertainty-based Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection, given a set containing known and unknown classes. Next, for the audio samples identified as OOD, we employ Novel Class Discovery (NCD) approach to cluster them into distinct unseen Raga classes. We achieve this by harnessing information from labelled data and further applying contrastive learning on unlabelled data. With thorough analysis, we demonstrate the influence of different components of the loss function on clustering performance and examine how varying openness affects the NCD task in hand.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying the benefit of load uncertainty reduction for the design of district energy systems under grid constraints using the Value of Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Langtry, Ruchi Choudhary</p>
            <p>Load uncertainty must be accounted for during design to ensure building energy systems can meet energy demands during operation. Reducing building load uncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified, reducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building monitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly. This study uses Value of Information analysis (VoI) to quantify the economic benefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design decisions, and determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. An extension of the VoI framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex decision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to a case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program model is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under uncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data. Load uncertainty is found to significantly impact both system operating costs ($\pm$30%) and the optimal system design ($\pm$20%). However, using building monitoring data to improve the design of the district reduces overall costs by less than 1.5% on average. As this is less than the cost of measurement, using monitoring is not economically worthwhile in this case. This provides the first numerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load profiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean load is found to provide most of the available decision support benefit, meaning using hourly measurement data provides little benefit for energy retrofit design.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a data-driven representation for linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, which can be used for direct data-driven analysis and control of such systems. Specifically, we use the behavioral approach to develop a data-driven representation of the finite-horizon behavior of LPV systems for which there exists a kernel representation with shifted-affine scheduling dependence. Moreover, we provide a necessary and sufficient rank-based test on the available data that concludes whether the data fully represents the finite-horizon LPV behavior. Using the proposed data-driven representation, we also solve the data-driven simulation problem for LPV systems. Through multiple examples, we demonstrate that the results in this paper allow us to formulate a novel set of direct data-driven analysis and control methods for LPV systems, which are also applicable for LPV embeddings of nonlinear systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiuxiu Ma, Abla Kammoun, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.</p>

            <p>Despite the plethora of AI-based algorithms developed for anomaly detection in radiology, subsequent integration into clinical setting is rarely evaluated. In this work, we assess the applicability and utility of an AI-based model for brain aneurysm detection comparing the performance of two readers with different levels of experience (2 and 13 years). We aim to answer the following questions: 1) Do the readers improve their performance when assisted by the AI algorithm? 2) How much does the AI algorithm impact routine clinical workflow? We reuse and enlarge our open-access, Time-Of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography dataset (N=460). We use 360 subjects for training/validating our algorithm and 100 as unseen test set for the reading session. Even though our model reaches state-of-the-art results on the test set (sensitivity=74%, false positive rate=1.6), we show that neither the junior nor the senior reader significantly increase their sensitivity (p=0.59, p=1, respectively). In addition, we find that reading time for both readers is significantly higher in the "AI-assisted" setting than in the "Unassisted" (+15 seconds, on average; p=3x10^(-4) junior, p=3x10^(-5) senior). The confidence reported by the readers is unchanged across the two settings, indicating that the AI assistance does not influence the certainty of the diagnosis. Our findings highlight the importance of clinical validation of AI algorithms in a clinical setting involving radiologists. This study should serve as a reminder to the community to always examine the real-word effectiveness and workflow impact of proposed algorithms.</p>

The developed identification method enables the estimation of multivariable parametric additive models in continuous time and is applicable to both open- and closed-loop systems. The performance of the estimator is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimentally validated on a flexible beam system.</p>

Moreover, for this value function, we introduce the Cesàro value iteration and prove its convergence for the special case of systems with periodic optimal operating behavior. For this instance, we also show that the Cesàro value function recovers the undiscounted infinite-horizon optimal cost, if the latter is well-defined.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyong Shin, Yongjeong Oh, Jinsung Park, Joohyuk Park, Yo-Seb Jeon</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel end-to-end digital semantic communication framework based on multi-codebook vector quantization (VQ), referred to as ESC-MVQ. Unlike prior approaches that rely on end-to-end training with a specific power or modulation scheme, often under a particular channel condition, ESC-MVQ models a channel transfer function as parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with trainable bit-flip probabilities. Building on this model, ESC-MVQ jointly trains multiple VQ codebooks and their associated bit-flip probabilities with a single encoder-decoder pair. To maximize inference performance when deploying ESC-MVQ in digital communication systems, we devise an optimal communication strategy that jointly optimizes codebook assignment, adaptive modulation, and power allocation. To this end, we develop an iterative algorithm that selects the most suitable VQ codebook for semantic features and flexibly allocates power and modulation schemes across the transmitted symbols. Simulation results demonstrate that ESC-MVQ, using a single encoder-decoder pair, outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods in both performance and memory efficiency, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for realizing digital semantic communication in diverse channel conditions.</p>

            <h2>A Deep Learning-Based Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Zhou, Kaijie Xu, Yinghui Quan, Mengdao Xing</p>
            <p>In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections. In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

            <h2>Theoretical Grid-Forming Extreme of Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxi Tang, Li Peng</p>
            <p>What are the theoretical and physical limits of a grid-forming inverter? This letter proposes that the extreme grid-forming ability of inverters is limited by their dc-side, ac-side, circuit topology dynamics, but not control. While many papers focus on how to improve grid-forming inverters stability, power sharing, inertia emulation, fault response, few, if any, formally define the fundamental theoretical limits or extremes of grid-forming behavior. It seems that the grid-forming can be improved endlessly. No physical system can support a grid indefinitely without limitations, especially under increasing levels of disturbance or uncertainty. Therefore, this boundary is explicitly shown by a mathematical expression in this letter. Consequently, the results show that relatively low dc-side voltage and high active power injection could damage the grid-forming ability. Poor consideration of dc-side, ac-side, and circuit topology dynamics in real practice will cause jeopardizing oscillation even by the theoretical best grid-forming control strategy.</p>

            <h2>MFA-KWS: Effective Keyword Spotting with Multi-head Frame-asynchronous Decoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Xi, Haoyu Li, Xiaoyu Gu, Yidi Jiang, Kai Yu</p>
            <p>Keyword spotting (KWS) is essential for voice-driven applications, demanding both accuracy and efficiency. Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.</p>

            <h2>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee</p>
            <p>Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.</p>

            <p>Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and fatal diseases worldwide, demanding accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment. Recent advancements in large AI models have significantly enhanced medical image understanding and clinical decision-making. This review systematically surveys the state-of-the-art in applying large AI models to lung cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We categorize existing models into modality-specific encoders, encoder-decoder frameworks, and joint encoder architectures, highlighting key examples such as CLIP, BLIP, Flamingo, BioViL-T, and GLoRIA. We further examine their performance in multimodal learning tasks using benchmark datasets like LIDC-IDRI, NLST, and MIMIC-CXR. Applications span pulmonary nodule detection, gene mutation prediction, multi-omics integration, and personalized treatment planning, with emerging evidence of clinical deployment and validation. Finally, we discuss current limitations in generalizability, interpretability, and regulatory compliance, proposing future directions for building scalable, explainable, and clinically integrated AI systems. Our review underscores the transformative potential of large AI models to personalize and optimize lung cancer care.</p>

            <p>Soft robots manufactured with flexible materials can be highly compliant and adaptive to their surroundings, which facilitates their application in areas such as dexterous manipulation and environmental exploration. This paper aims at investigating the tracking control problem for soft robots under uncertainty such as unmodeled dynamics and external disturbance. First, we establish a novel switching function and design the compensated tracking error dynamics by virtue of the command filter. Then, based on the backstepping methodology, the virtual controllers and the adaptive logic estimating the supremum of uncertainty impacts are developed for synthesizing an event-triggered control strategy. In addition, the uniformed finite-time stability certification is derived for different scenarios of the switching function. Finally, we perform a case study of a soft robot to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Score-based Generative Diffusion Models to Synthesize Full-dose FDG Brain PET from MRI in Epilepsy Patients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaqi Wu, Jiahong Ouyang, Farshad Moradi, Mohammad Mehdi Khalighi, Greg Zaharchuk</p>
            <p>Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate patients with epilepsy is one of the most common applications for simultaneous PET/MRI, given the need to image both brain structure and metabolism, but is suboptimal due to the radiation dose in this young population. Little work has been done synthesizing diagnostic quality PET images from MRI data or MRI data with ultralow-dose PET using advanced generative AI methods, such as diffusion models, with attention to clinical evaluations tailored for the epilepsy population. Here we compared the performance of diffusion- and non-diffusion-based deep learning models for the MRI-to-PET image translation task for epilepsy imaging using simultaneous PET/MRI in 52 subjects (40 train/2 validate/10 hold-out test). We tested three different models: 2 score-based generative diffusion models (SGM-Karras Diffusion [SGM-KD] and SGM-variance preserving [SGM-VP]) and a Transformer-Unet. We report results on standard image processing metrics as well as clinically relevant metrics, including congruency measures (Congruence Index and Congruency Mean Absolute Error) that assess hemispheric metabolic asymmetry, which is a key part of the clinical analysis of these images. The SGM-KD produced the best qualitative and quantitative results when synthesizing PET purely from T1w and T2 FLAIR images with the least mean absolute error in whole-brain specific uptake value ratio (SUVR) and highest intraclass correlation coefficient. When 1% low-dose PET images are included in the inputs, all models improve significantly and are interchangeable for quantitative performance and visual quality. In summary, SGMs hold great potential for pure MRI-to-PET translation, while all 3 model types can synthesize full-dose FDG-PET accurately using MRI and ultralow-dose PET.</p>

            <h2>Symmetric Sliding-Mode Control of Grid-Forming Inverters With Controllable Region Under AC and DC Sides Varying</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxi Tang, Li Peng</p>
            <p>Conventional grid-forming (GFM) controls often entangle voltage formation with power flow and dc-source dynamics, which can degrade voltage tracking performance and stability under grid disturbances, load transients, and dc-side perturbations. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC) method is developed and its explicit voltage controllable region is derived. It illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when the entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by this insight, a symmetric compensation structure is proposed, which avoids added design complexity and directly mitigates low-frequency voltage tracking errors. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster tracking responses-on the order of hundreds of microseconds-while maintaining robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode controllers, which handle these disturbances separately, cannot match this combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage controllability analysis is explicitly verified.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in audio-text large language models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for music understanding and generation. However, existing benchmarks are limited in scope, often relying on simplified tasks or multi-choice evaluations that fail to reflect the complexity of real-world music analysis. We reinterpret a broad range of traditional MIR annotations as instruction-following formats and introduce CMI-Bench, a comprehensive music instruction following benchmark designed to evaluate audio-text LLMs on a diverse set of music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. These include genre classification, emotion regression, emotion tagging, instrument classification, pitch estimation, key detection, lyrics transcription, melody extraction, vocal technique recognition, instrument performance technique detection, music tagging, music captioning, and (down)beat tracking: reflecting core challenges in MIR research. Unlike previous benchmarks, CMI-Bench adopts standardized evaluation metrics consistent with previous state-of-the-art MIR models, ensuring direct comparability with supervised approaches. We provide an evaluation toolkit supporting all open-source audio-textual LLMs, including LTU, Qwen-audio, SALMONN, MusiLingo, etc. Experiment results reveal significant performance gaps between LLMs and supervised models, along with their culture, chronological and gender bias, highlighting the potential and limitations of current models in addressing MIR tasks. CMI-Bench establishes a unified foundation for evaluating music instruction following, driving progress in music-aware LLMs.</p>

            <p>Accurate gestational age (GA) estimation, ideally through fetal ultrasound measurement, is a crucial aspect of providing excellent antenatal care. However, deriving GA from manual fetal biometric measurements depends on the operator and is time-consuming. Hence, automatic computer-assisted methods are demanded in clinical practice. In this paper, we present a novel feature fusion framework to estimate GA using fetal ultrasound images without any measurement information. We adopt a deep learning model to extract deep representations from ultrasound images. We extract radiomic features to reveal patterns and characteristics of fetal brain growth. To harness the interpretability of radiomics in medical imaging analysis, we estimate GA by fusing radiomic features and deep representations. Our framework estimates GA with a mean absolute error of 8.0 days across three trimesters, outperforming current machine learning-based methods at these gestational ages. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our framework across different populations in diverse geographical regions. Our code is publicly available on \href{this https URL}.</p>

            <p>While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

            <h2>Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anirban Ray, Ashesh, Florian Jug</p>
            <p>Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</p>

            <p>Acousto-optic sensing provides an alternative approach to traditional microphone arrays by shedding light on the interaction of light with an acoustic field. Sound field reconstruction is a fascinating and advanced technique used in acousto-optics sensing. Current challenges in sound-field reconstruction methods pertain to scenarios in which the sound source is located within the reconstruction area, known as the exterior problem. Existing reconstruction algorithms, primarily designed for interior scenarios, often exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to exterior cases. This paper introduces a novel technique for exterior sound-field reconstruction. The proposed method leverages concentric circle sampling and a two-dimensional exterior sound-field reconstruction approach based on circular harmonic extensions. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted. The results highlight the superior accuracy of the proposed method when compared to conventional reconstruction methods, all while utilizing a minimal amount of measured projection data.</p>

            <p>Significant progress has been made in anomaly detection and run-time monitoring to improve the safety and security of cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, less attention has been paid to hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.</p>

            <p>Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series plays a vital role in ensuring the stable operation of complex systems. Traditional methods often assume that normal data follow a single Gaussian distribution and identify anomalies as deviations from this distribution. {\color{black} However, this simplified assumption fails to capture the diversity and structural complexity of real-world time series, which can lead to misjudgments and reduced detection performance in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a new method that combines a neighborhood-driven data augmentation strategy with a multi-manifold representation learning framework.} By incorporating information from local neighborhoods, the augmentation module can simulate contextual variations of normal data, enhancing the model's adaptability to distributional changes. In addition, we design a structure-aware feature learning approach that encourages natural clustering of similar patterns in the feature space while maintaining sufficient distinction between different operational states. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness, showing strong potential for generalization and real-world deployment.</p>

            <p>Federated learning (FL) allows participants to collaboratively train machine learning models while keeping their data local, making it ideal for collaborations among healthcare institutions on sensitive data. However, in this paper, we propose a novel privacy attack called MedLeak, which allows a malicious FL server to recover high-quality site-specific private medical data from the client model updates. MedLeak works by introducing an adversarially crafted model during the FL training process. Honest clients, unaware of the insidious changes in the published models, continue to send back their updates as per the standard FL protocol. Leveraging a novel analytical method, MedLeak can efficiently recover private client data from the aggregated parameter updates, eliminating costly optimization. In addition, the scheme relies solely on the aggregated updates, thus rendering secure aggregation protocols ineffective, as they depend on the randomization of intermediate results for security while leaving the final aggregated results unaltered. We implement MedLeak on medical image datasets (MedMNIST, COVIDx CXR-4, and Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI), as well as a medical text dataset (MedAbstract). The results demonstrate that our attack achieves high recovery rates and strong quantitative scores on both image and text datasets. We also thoroughly evaluate MedLeak across different attack parameters, providing insights into key factors that influence attack performance and potential defenses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the recovered data can support downstream tasks such as disease classification with minimal performance loss. Our findings validate the need for enhanced privacy measures in FL systems, particularly for safeguarding sensitive medical data against powerful model inversion attacks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Ali Ahmadi, Abraar Chaudhry, Cemil Dibek</p>
            <p>We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.</p>

            <p>Re-orchestration is the process of adapting a music piece for a different set of instruments. By altering the original instrumentation, the orchestrator often modifies the musical texture while preserving a recognizable melodic line and ensures that each part is playable within the technical and expressive capabilities of the chosen instruments.

This model performs symbolic instrumental and textural music style transfers with a focus on melodic fidelity and controllability. We allow bar- and track-level controllability of the accompaniment with various textural attributes while keeping a homophonic texture. With both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that our model outperforms style transfer models on a re-orchestration task in terms of generation quality and controllability. Moreover, it can be adapted for a lead sheet orchestration task as a zero-shot learning model, achieving performance comparable to a model specifically trained for this task.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) prompted with text and audio have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various auditory tasks, including speech, music, and general audio, showing emergent abilities on unseen tasks. However, their potential has yet to be fully demonstrated in bioacoustics tasks, such as detecting animal vocalizations in large recordings, classifying rare and endangered species, and labeling context and behavior -- tasks that are crucial for conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and animal behavior studies. In this work, we present NatureLM-audio, the first audio-language foundation model specifically designed for bioacoustics. Our training dataset consists of carefully curated text-audio pairs spanning bioacoustics, speech, and music, designed to address the field's limited availability of annotated data. We demonstrate successful transfer of learned representations from music and speech to bioacoustics, and our model shows promising generalization to unseen taxa and tasks. We evaluate NatureLM-audio on a novel benchmark (BEANS-Zero) and it sets a new state of the art on several bioacoustics tasks, including zero-shot classification of unseen species. To advance bioacoustics research, we release our model weights, benchmark data, and open-source the code for training and benchmark data generation and model training.</p>

            <h2>FreeCodec: A disentangled neural speech codec with fewer tokens</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youqiang Zheng, Weiping Tu, Yueteng Kang, Jie Chen, Yike Zhang, Li Xiao, Yuhong Yang, Long Ma</p>
            <p>Neural speech codecs have gained great attention for their outstanding reconstruction with discrete token representations. It is a crucial component in generative tasks such as speech coding and large language models (LLM). However, most works based on residual vector quantization perform worse with fewer tokens due to low coding efficiency for modeling complex coupled information. In this paper, we propose a neural speech codec named FreeCodec which employs a more effective encoding framework by decomposing intrinsic properties of speech into different components: 1) a global vector is extracted as the timbre information, 2) a prosody encoder with a long stride level is used to model the prosody information, 3) the content information is from a content encoder. Using different training strategies, FreeCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and disentanglement scenarios. Results from subjective and objective experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods.</p>

            <h2>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taekyung Ki, Dongchan Min, Gyeongsu Chae</p>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Zhou, Yubing Li</p>
            <p>This paper attacks time-domain identification for interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. The obtained results can also be applied to parameter estimations for a lumped QBTI system. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated generalized TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from time-domain input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these generalized TFMs. A numerical example is included to illustrate characteristics of the suggested estimation algorithms.</p>

            <h2>DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Caetano, Christiaan Viviers, Luis A. Zavala-Mondragón, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen</p>
            <p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.</p>

            <h2>Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pallavi Sharma, Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero, Bogdan Bogdan, Adrian-Dumitru Ciotec, Laura Vasilie, Henning Wessels, Matteo Skull</p>
            <p>This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk signals from torque demand in the context of limited real-world drivetrain datasets. We implement both unconditional and conditional VAEs, trained on experimental data from two variants of a fully electric SUV with differing torque and drivetrain configurations. The VAEs synthesize jerk signals that capture characteristics from multiple drivetrain scenarios by leveraging the learned latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs, without requiring detailed system parametrization. Unconditional VAEs generate realistic jerk signals without prior system knowledge, while conditional VAEs enable the generation of signals tailored to specific torque inputs. This approach reduces the dependence on costly and time-intensive real-world experiments and extensive manual modeling. The results support the integration of generative models such as VAEs into drivetrain simulation pipelines, both for data augmentation and for efficient exploration of complex operational scenarios, with the potential to streamline validation and accelerate vehicle development.</p>

            <h2>Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijiang Yan, Jianhua Pei, Hongda Wu, Hina Tabassum, Ping Wang</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhan Suo, Runqi Chai, Kaiyuan Chen, Senchun Chai, Wannian Liang, Yuanqing Xia</p>
            <p>With the large-scale integration of Internet of Things (IoT) into enterprise information management systems, organizations are pursuing digital transformation that hinges on real-time data insights-and yet face escalating security and governance risks. Detecting and responding to threats at scale without impairing system efficiency has therefore become a critical information-management and decision-support challenge for today's executives. This paper develops a distributed, gain-based anomaly-detection framework tailored to IoT-enabled enterprise systems, underpinned by an optimized sensor-subset partitioning strategy. Starting from the perspective of set partitioning strategies, this study analyzes the key factor that contributes to the performance differences between distributed and centralized algorithms. By examining the gain mutual influence of sensor subsets, an optimal set partitioning strategy is designed to minimize inter-subset mutual influence while enhancing intra-subset correlation. To further reduce the computational cost of gain updates, a suboptimal partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, improving the efficiency of selecting suspicious sensors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach effectively reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing attack detection performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Zorzenon, Jörg Raisch</p>
            <p>Given a max-plus linear system and a semimodule, the problem of computing the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule is still open to this day. In this paper, we consider this problem for the specific class of fully actuated systems and constraints in the form of precedence semimodules. The assumption of full actuation corresponds to the existence of an input for each component of the system state. A precedence semimodule is the set of solutions of inequalities typically used to represent time-window constraints. We prove that, in this setting, it is possible to (i) compute the maximal controlled invariant subsemimodule and (ii) decide the convergence of a fixed-point algorithm introduced by R.D.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayi Yao, Shuowen Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thijs Havinga, Xianjun Jiao, Wei Liu, Baiheng Chen, Adnan Shahid, Ingrid Moerman</p>
            <p>Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) poses challenges for the performance and robustness of wireless networks. There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we design a novel distributed learning algorithm using stochastic compressed communications. In detail, we pursue a modular approach, merging ADMM and a gradient-based approach, benefiting from the robustness of the former and the computational efficiency of the latter. Additionally, we integrate a stochastic integral action (error feedback) enabling almost sure rejection of the compression error. We analyze the resulting method in nonconvex scenarios and guarantee almost sure asymptotic convergence to the set of stationary points of the problem. This result is obtained using system-theoretic tools based on stochastic timescale separation. We corroborate our findings with numerical simulations in nonconvex classification.</p>

            <p>This study introduces an enhanced approach to video super-resolution by extending ordinary Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) structure to handle spatio-temporal data. While SRGAN has proven effective for single-image enhancement, its design does not account for the temporal continuity required in video processing. To address this, a modified framework that incorporates 3D Non-Local Blocks is proposed, which is enabling the model to capture relationships across both spatial and temporal dimensions. An experimental training pipeline is developed, based on patch-wise learning and advanced data degradation techniques, to simulate real-world video conditions and learn from both local and global structures and details. This helps the model generalize better and maintain stability across varying video content while maintaining the general structure besides the pixel-wise correctness. Two model variants-one larger and one more lightweight-are presented to explore the trade-offs between performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate improved temporal coherence, sharper textures, and fewer visual artifacts compared to traditional single-image methods. This work contributes to the development of practical, learning-based solutions for video enhancement tasks, with potential applications in streaming, gaming, and digital restoration.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in expressive text-to-speech (TTS) have introduced diverse methods based on style embedding extracted from reference speech. However, synthesizing high-quality expressive speech remains challenging. We propose Spotlight-TTS, which exclusively emphasizes style via voiced-aware style extraction and style direction adjustment. Voiced-aware style extraction focuses on voiced regions highly related to style while maintaining continuity across different speech regions to improve expressiveness. We adjust the direction of the extracted style for optimal integration into the TTS model, which improves speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that Spotlight-TTS achieves superior performance compared to baseline models in terms of expressiveness, overall speech quality, and style transfer capability.

To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Soundtrack Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre.

            <p>The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders, and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability. Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.</p>

            <h2>Joint RIS-UE Association and Beamforming Design in RIS-Assisted Cell-Free MIMO Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongqin Ke, Jindan Xu, Wei Xu, Chau Yuen, Zhaohua Lu</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cell-free (CF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks can significantly enhance system performance. However, the extensive deployment of RIS elements imposes considerable channel acquisition overhead, with the high density of nodes and antennas in RIS-assisted CF networks amplifying this challenge. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we explore integrating RIS-user equipment (UE) association into downlink RIS-assisted CF transmitter design, which greatly reduces the channel acquisition costs. The key point is that once UEs are associated with specific RISs, there is no need to frequently acquire channels from non-associated RISs. Then, we formulate the problem of joint RIS-UE association and beamforming at APs and RISs to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). In particular, we propose a two-stage framework to solve it. In the first stage, we apply a many-to-many matching algorithm to establish the RIS-UE association. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential optimization-based method that decomposes the joint optimization of RIS phase shifts and AP beamforming into two distinct subproblems. To optimize the RIS phase shifts, we employ the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to obtain a semi-closed-form solution. For AP beamforming, we develop a joint block diagonalization algorithm, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that, while RIS-UE association significantly reduces overhead, it incurs a minor performance loss that remains within an acceptable range. Additionally, we investigate the impact of RIS deployment and conclude that RISs exhibit enhanced performance when positioned between APs and UEs.</p>

            <p>With an increasing share of renewable energy sources, accurate and efficient modeling of grid-forming inverters is becoming crucial for system stability. Linear methods are a powerful tool for understanding dynamics close to an operating point, but usually depend on the reference trajectory. Thus, small deviations can render linear models invalid over time, posing a significant challenge in practice, and complicating theoretical analysis. As a solution, we show that the complex phase offers a robust formulation independent of reference phases and frequencies, thus preserving invariance properties under linearization. This enables robust system identification during realistic conditions and opens the road to powerful stability analysis of inverter-based grids.</p>

            <p>The intensive integration of power converters is changing the way that power systems operate, leading to the emergence of new types of dynamic phenomena and instabilities. At the same time, converters act as an interface between traditional AC grids and their more recent DC counterparts, giving rise to hybrid AC/DC networks. These conditions increase the necessity for stability analysis tools that can simultaneously account for the newly-introduced dynamic phenomena and can also be applied for the stability study of hybrid networks. This paper presents a Matlab-based toolbox for small-signal analysis of hybrid AC/DC power systems considering electromagnetic-transient (EMT) models. The toolbox allows the automatized modeling of the system from the input data and offers options for modal, impedance and passivity analyses. In the paper, the structure and internal processes of the toolbox are duly discussed, together with all its features, both main and complementary. Its capabilities for stability analysis are demonstrated via comprehensive case studies of converter-based system of various size and topology.</p>

            <h2>Economic Model Predictive Control with a Non-Fixed Reference Trajectory for Optimal Microgrid Dispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avik Ghosh, Adil Khurram, Jan Kleissl, Sonia Martinez</p>
            <p>Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC), instead of stabilizing a reference trajectory/state in the objective function like a Tracking MPC, optimizes the economic performance over the prediction horizon, making it attractive for economical microgrid (MG) dispatch. However, the demand charge component in the monthly electricity cost, make it difficult to be encapsulated in additive stage costs, and can make solutions violate the principle of optimality if naively introduced in the objective function. Moreover, previous EMPC based works mostly rely on a-priori knowledge of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory for performance guarantees, which are not useful or possibly don't exist respectively, for real-time economical MG dispatch where load/generation forecasts are known only 24-48 h in advance. This paper, first, proposes an EMPC formulation for a generic deterministic discrete non-linear time varying system with hard state and input constraints, without any a-priori requirements of an optimal economic steady state or optimal periodic trajectory. It is proved that under mild assumptions on terminal cost and region, the asymptotic average economic cost of the proposed method is no worse than the asymptotic average economic cost of any other non-fixed arbitrary reference trajectory which is known only until the current time-step. The EMPC framework is then leveraged for optimal MG dispatch by showing that the problem can be reformulated to satisfy the assumptions required for the asymptotic performance guarantee. Realistic simulations at the Port of San Diego MG demonstrated that the proposed method can also reduce monthly electricity costs in closed-loop with respect to reference trajectories generated by directly optimizing the electricity cost function over the prediction horizon or by tracking an ideal grid import curve in a majority of the cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Bruninx, Timothy Verstraeten, Jalal Kazempour, Jan Helsen</p>
            <p>We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</p>

            <h2>DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>\textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Parameter Design for Power Electronic Converters Using a Probabilistic Learning-Based Stochastic Surrogate Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Mahajan, Shivam Chaturvedi, Srijita Das, Wencong Su, Van-Hai Bui</p>
            <p>The selection of optimal design for power electronic converter parameters involves balancing efficiency and thermal constraints to ensure high performance without compromising safety. This paper introduces a probabilistic-learning-based stochastic surrogate modeling framework to address this challenge and significantly reduce the time required during the design phase. The approach begins with a neural network classifier that evaluates the feasibility of parameter configurations, effectively filtering out unsafe and/or impractical inputs. Subsequently, a probabilistic prediction model estimates the converter's efficiency and temperature while quantifying prediction uncertainty, providing both performance insights and reliability metrics. Finally, a heuristic optimization-based model is employed to optimize a multi-objective function that maximizes efficiency while adhering to thermal constraints. The optimization process incorporates penalty terms to discourage solutions that violate practical thresholds, ensuring actionable and realistic recommendations. An advanced heuristic optimization method is used to find the optimal solution and is compared with several well-known search algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu-Search (TS), and Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC). The results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes, offering a robust solution for advancing power electronics design.</p>

            <h2>Estimating Technical Loss without Power Flows: A Practical, Data-Driven Approach for Loss Estimation in Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohini Bariya, Genevieve Flaspohler</p>
            <p>Electric grids in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the world face an acute challenge. To support global decarbonisation efforts and raise millions from energy poverty, these grids must shoulder substantial load growth while integrating distributed renewable generation. However, decades of rapid and poorly funded infrastructure expansions have led to national grids in many LMICs that are strained and weak, composed of aging, faulty, and undersized infrastructure. A cause and symptom of this weakness is excessive technical loss within the grid infrastructure during energy delivery, particularly at the distribution level; network losses are regularly estimated to be well over 20 percent, compared to a baseline of 5 percent in higher-income nations. Addressing technical loss through targeted interventions is essential for bolstering grids' physical and economic strength. Unfortunately, current approaches for estimating and localizing technical loss require expensive, extensive power flow sensing, which is essentially absent in LMIC distribution systems. We present a novel approach to technical loss estimation without power flows, which leverages more readily available voltage magnitude measurements at sparse locations in the grid. This estimator puts loss estimation and localization within reach for LMIC grids globally, and provides a critical tool for the effective design, implementation, and evaluation of loss-reduction interventions.</p>

            <h2>Joint Scheduling of DER under Demand Charges: Structure and Approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixiao Yang, Gulai Shen, Ahmed S. Alahmed, Chuchu Fan</p>
            <p>We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering frameworks with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the structure of the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based form. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to the theoretical upper bound.</p>

            <h2>A Review of Safe Reinforcement Learning Methods for Modern Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Su, Tong Wu, Junbo Zhao, Anna Scaglione, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Given the availability of more comprehensive measurement data in modern power systems, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant interest in operation and control. Conventional RL relies on trial-and-error interactions with the environment and reward feedback, which often leads to exploring unsafe operating regions and executing unsafe actions, especially when deployed in real-world power systems. To address these challenges, safe RL has been proposed to optimize operational objectives while ensuring safety constraints are met, keeping actions and states within safe regions throughout both training and deployment. Rather than relying solely on manually designed penalty terms for unsafe actions, as is common in conventional RL, safe RL methods reviewed here primarily leverage advanced and proactive mechanisms. These include techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation, safety layers, and theoretical guarantees like Lyapunov functions to rigorously enforce safety boundaries. This paper provides a comprehensive review of safe RL methods and their applications across various power system operations and control domains, including security control, real-time operation, operational planning, and emerging areas. It summarizes existing safe RL techniques, evaluates their performance, analyzes suitable deployment scenarios, and examines algorithm benchmarks and application environments. The paper also highlights real-world implementation cases and identifies critical challenges such as scalability in large-scale systems and robustness under uncertainty, providing potential solutions and outlining future directions to advance the reliable integration and deployment of safe RL in modern power systems.</p>

            <p>The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oktay Karakuş, Padraig Corcoran</p>
            <p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is increasingly critical to sustainable transport systems, yet its resilience under environmental and infrastructural stress remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce RSERI-EV, a spatially explicit and multi-modal risk assessment framework that combines remote sensing data, open infrastructure datasets, and spatial graph analytics to evaluate the vulnerability of EV charging stations. RSERI-EV integrates diverse data layers, including flood risk maps, land surface temperature (LST) extremes, vegetation indices (NDVI), land use/land cover (LULC), proximity to electrical substations, and road accessibility to generate a composite Resilience Score. We apply this framework to the country of Wales EV charger dataset to demonstrate its feasibility. A spatial $k$-nearest neighbours ($k$NN) graph is constructed over the charging network to enable neighbourhood-based comparisons and graph-aware diagnostics. Our prototype highlights the value of multi-source data fusion and interpretable spatial reasoning in supporting climate-resilient, infrastructure-aware EV deployment.</p>

            <p>Future electrical grids will require new ways to identify faults as inverters are not capable of supplying large fault currents to support existing fault detection methods and because distributed resources may feed faults from the edge of the grid. This paper proposes the use of real-time system identification for online power-system fault detection. Specifically, we implement Recursive ARX (rARX) system identification on a grid-connected inverter. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed rARX method is able to both detect large faults quickly, and distinguish between high-impedance faults and large load increases. These results indicate that rARX grid-edge fault detection is a promising research direction for improving the reliability and safety of modern electric grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Zeeshan Mumtaz, Mohammadali Mohammadi, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) capability of a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, in the context of power consumption (PC) efficiency. The network users are divided into two functional categories: information decoding (ID) users and energy harvesting (EH) users. Non-stationary near-field channels are considered whilst the users are located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs). We formulate a two-tier joint optimization problem to minimize the PC, taking into account the power allocation (PA) for ID and EH users, along with the activation of constituent XL-MIMO subarrays. This complicated mixed-integer problem is transformed into more tractable formulations and efficient algorithms are proposed for solving them. The numerical results demonstrate that the overall PC of the XL-MIMO system for the proposed method is reduced by more than 60% in comparison to the benchmark scheme of equal PA with full subarray activation (SA) and 30% against the case of optimized PA with full SA, while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints on both the downlink rate of the ID users and harvested energy at the EH users.</p>

            <p>This paper explores the maximization of the harvested power efficiency (HPE) in a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system, which supports energy harvesting (EH) for near-field users. These users are located in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs) with non-stationary channel characteristics. We propose to determine which sub-arrays are switched on or off as well the power control coefficients at the sub-arrays to maximize the HPE. The design can be processed via a multi-tier joint optimization framework based on fractional programming. The numerical results showcase that the HPE performance of the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal, comparable to that of exhaustive search. As a matter of fact, it achieves up to a 120% gain over the benchmark scheme which uses the entire XL-MIMO array with equal power allocation (PA) across sub-arrays, while significantly reducing the computational time.</p>

            <h2>A Data-Driven Approach for Topology Correction in Low Voltage Networks with DERs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Liu, Sander Timmerman, Yu Xiang, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a data-driven topology identification and correction approach for low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) combined with a time-based smart meter data selection strategy, aiming to correct outdated recordings and identify the missed recordings. The proposed approach solely relies on voltage magnitude measurements, releasing privacy concerns and measurement burdens. It enables the distribution system operators to identify switch states through supervised learning algorithms, as well as determine user-feeder connections and phase labels of customers by a modified Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. To address the similarity among smart meter (SM) data caused by distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems, a time-based SM data selection strategy is combined with the proposed correlation analysis. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach are validated using modified real-world LVDNs and multiple incomplete SM datasets collected from customers in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate that the time-based SM data selection strategy effectively mitigates their impact on phase identification, and the corrected topology not only improves network observability but also supports network operators in load balancing and PV consumption.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing the Impact of Strategic Bidding on the Reserve Capacity via a Bi-Level Model</h2>

            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources necessitates adequate reserve capacity to maintain power balance. However, in market clearing, power companies with flexible resources may submit strategic bids to maximize profits, potentially compromising system reserves. This paper examines the effects of such strategic behavior by modeling the market as a bi-level problem. The upper level represents a strategic company aiming to maximize profit, while the lower level simulates the system operator clearing the market based on submitted offers. To enable duality-based solution methods, we approximate unit commitments with a continuous reserve capacity calculation. Case studies indicate that, in an imperfectly competitive market, more units are incentivized to operate,enhancing system reserves. However, some units go online mainly for profit, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. These findings highlight the importance of market design in managing the trade-off between reserve adequacy and economic efficiency in the presence of strategic bidding behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Mole, Max Weissenbacher, Georgios Rigas, Sylvain Laizet</p>
            <p>Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production. Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static, low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable energy deployment to net-zero targets.</p>

            <p>We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters.

By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</p>

            <p>Time-domain simulations are crucial for ensuring power system stability and avoiding critical scenarios that could lead to blackouts. The next-generation power systems require a significant increase in the computational cost and complexity of these simulations due to additional degrees of uncertainty, non-linearity and states. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been shown to accelerate single-component simulations by several orders of magnitude. However, their application to current time-domain simulation solvers has been particularly challenging since the system's dynamics depend on multiple components. Using a new training formulation, this paper introduces the first natural step to integrate PINNs into multi-component time-domain simulations. We propose PINNs as an alternative to other classical numerical methods for individual components. Once trained, these neural networks approximate component dynamics more accurately for longer time steps. Formulated as an implicit and consistent method with the transient simulation workflow, PINNs speed up simulation time by significantly increasing the time steps used. For explanation clarity, we demonstrate the training, integration, and simulation framework for several combinations of PINNs and numerical solution methods using the IEEE 9-bus system, although the method applies equally well to any power system size.</p>

By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eunhyuk Park, Seok-Hwan Park, Osvaldo Simeone, Marco Di Renzo, Shlomo Shamai</p>
            <p>As the dense deployment of access points (APs) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems presents significant challenges, per-AP coverage can be expanded using large-scale antenna arrays (LAAs). However, this approach incurs high implementation costs and substantial fronthaul demands due to the need for dedicated RF chains for all antennas. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid beamforming framework that integrates wave-domain beamforming via stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) with conventional digital processing. By dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves, SIM-equipped APs enhance beamforming gains while significantly reducing RF chain requirements. We formulate a joint optimization problem for digital and wave-domain beamforming along with fronthaul compression to maximize the weighted sum-rate for both uplink and downlink transmission under finite-capacity fronthaul constraints. Given the high dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem, we develop alternating optimization-based algorithms that iteratively optimize digital and wave-domain variables. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid schemes outperform conventional hybrid schemes, that rely on randomly set wave-domain beamformers or restrict digital beamforming to simple power control. Moreover, the proposed scheme employing sufficiently deep SIMs achieves near fully-digital performance with fewer RF chains in most simulated cases, except in the downlink at low signal-to-noise ratios.</p>

            <p>The recent widespread adoption of rooftop solar backed by battery storage is enabling energy customers to both produce and consume electricity (i.e., prosumers of electricity). To facilitate prosumer participation in the electric grid, new market mechanisms are required. In this paper, we design peer-to-peer energy markets where prosumers trade their excess energy with peers to gain profit while satisfying the overall balance in electricity supply and demand. We first consider a market structure, considering the case where voltage and/or thermal constraints are binding. When such grid constraints are binding, market clearing prices can vary across locations. However, heterogeneous prices may be considered by regulators to lack fairness. To ensure uniform pricing, we design two peer-to-peer energy markets with dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). DOEs enable us to decompose global voltage and thermal constraints across the power grid into local constraints for each prosumer, resulting in uniform prices across the grid. By means of numerical simulations on an IEEE 13-node feeder, we benchmark the proposed market-based approaches in the presence of binding voltage constraints.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces an efficient Residual Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework for voltage control in active distribution grids. Voltage control remains a critical challenge in distribution grids, where conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods often suffer from slow training convergence and inefficient exploration. To overcome these challenges, the proposed RRL approach learns a residual policy on top of a modified Sequential Droop Control (SDC) mechanism, ensuring faster convergence. Additionally, the framework introduces a Local Shared Linear (LSL) architecture for the Q-network and a Transformer-Encoder actor network, which collectively enhance overall performance. Unlike several existing approaches, the proposed method relies solely on inverters' measurements without requiring full state information of the power grid, rendering it more practical for real-world deployment. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the RRL framework in achieving rapid convergence, minimizing active power curtailment, and ensuring reliable voltage regulation.</p>

            <p>During grid faults, grid-forming converters are typically suggested to switch from a voltage-source to a current-source mode to limit the current and protect the electronics. This transition has the potential for the converter to transiently lose synchronization due to such current saturation. Therefore, this paper proposes an alternative current saturation algorithm to improve transient synchronization stability during mode switching. The algorithm is designed for grid-forming converters to meet low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) requirements and grid-fault standards in addition to transient synchronization stability. Moreover, it limits the converter output current during grid faults with a new control parameter. The presented method introduces converter output virtual fluxes to calculate the current references in the d- and q-axes for the current saturation algorithm to enhance LVRT performance and grid stability. The method exploits the correlation between the converter's virtual fluxes and currents to modify the current saturation levels through real-time converter virtual flux estimation. The adaptive saturation levels ensure precise control and high dynamics during grid faults and facilitate optimal power injection or absorption to support the grid. The proposed current-saturation algorithm is analytically evaluated. Further, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p>Owing to the advanced communication networks and intelligent electronic devices, the cyber-physical distribution systems (CPDSs) possess the capability to perform flexible economic dispatch and achieve rapid self-healing from extreme events. Meanwhile, the deep integration of cyber and physical systems makes CPDS vulnerable to coordinated cyber-physical attacks. In this paper, a resilience assessment framework for the CPDS under coordinated cyber-physical attacks is proposed to investigate the impact of the coordinated attacks on load loss and service restoration in CPDS. First, a three-stage defender-attacker-defender dynamic game model considering fake base station (FBS) and physical attacks for CPDS is established, aiming at seeking the optimal defense resource deployment strategy to enhance the resilience of the CPDS. The physical attack is launched to cause faults on the power lines, and the FBS attack is employed to interrupt the service of wireless cellular network to hinder the self-healing process of the CPDS. The lognormal shadowing model and search theory are applied to quantitatively describe the process of the coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Further, the constructed three-stage dynamic game model is equivalently recast as a tri-level max-min-max optimization model, which is solved using column-and-constraint generation combined with enumeration method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed resilience assessment framework and solution strategy is demonstrated by conducting simulation analysis on the modified IEEE 33-node CPDS and a real-world 47-node CPDS in China.</p>

            <h2>PGLib-CO2: A Power Grid Library for Computing and Optimizing Carbon Emissions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's this http URL, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.</p>

            <h2>Densify & Conquer: Densified, smaller base-stations can conquer the increasing carbon footprint problem in nextG wireless</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agrim Gupta, Adel Heidari, Jiaming Jin, Dinesh Bharadia</p>
            <p>Connectivity on-the-go has been one of the most impressive technological achievements in the 2010s decade. However, multiple studies show that this has come at an expense of increased carbon footprint, that also rivals the entire aviation sector's carbon footprint. The two major contributors of this increased footprint are (a) smartphone batteries which affect the embodied footprint and (b) base-stations that occupy ever-increasing energy footprint to provide the last mile wireless connectivity to smartphones. The root-cause of both these turn out to be the same, which is communicating over the last-mile lossy wireless medium. We show in this paper, titled DensQuer, how base-station densification, which is to replace a single larger base-station with multiple smaller ones, reduces the effect of the last-mile wireless, and in effect conquers both these adverse sources of increased carbon footprint. Backed by a open-source ray-tracing computation framework (Sionna), we show how a strategic densification strategy can minimize the number of required smaller base-stations to practically achievable numbers, which lead to about 3x power-savings in the base-station network. Also, DensQuer is able to also reduce the required deployment height of base-stations to as low as 15m, that makes the smaller cells easily deployable on trees/street poles instead of requiring a dedicated tower. Further, by utilizing newly introduced hardware power rails in Google Pixel 7a and above phones, we also show that this strategic densified network leads to reduction in mobile transmit power by 10-15 dB, leading to about 3x reduction in total cellular power consumption, and about 50% increase in smartphone battery life when it communicates data via the cellular network.</p>

            <h2>A Digital Twin Framework for Generation-IV Reactors with Reinforcement Learning-Enabled Health-Aware Supervisory Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jasmin Y. Lim, Dimitrios Pylorof, Humberto E. Garcia, Karthik Duraisamy</p>
            <p>Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety, reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making, and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor, utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements, and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation, with general applicability to other advanced reactor concepts and complex engineering systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Operating Strategy for PV-BESS Households: Balancing Self-Consumption and Self-Sufficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Wook Heo, Raja Jurdak, Sara Khalifa</p>
            <p>High penetration of Photovoltaic (PV) generation and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) in individual households increases the demand for solutions to determine the optimal PV generation power and the capacity of BESS. Self-consumption and self-sufficiency are essential for optimising the operation of PV-BESS systems in households, aiming to minimise power import from and export to the main grid. However, self-consumption and self-sufficiency are not independent; they share a linear relationship. This paper demonstrates this relationship and proposes an optimal operating strategy that considers power generation and consumption profiles to maximise self-consumption and self-sufficiency in households equipped with a PV-BESS. We classify self-consumption and self-sufficiency patterns into four categories based on the ratio of self-sufficiency to self-consumption for each household and determine the optimal PV generation and BESS capacities using both a mathematical calculation and this ratio. These optimal operation values for each category are then simulated using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based battery charging and discharging scheduling models. The results show that the ratio between self-consumption and self-sufficiency is a useful metric for determining the optimal capacity of PV-BESS systems to maximise the local utilisation of PV-generated power.</p>

            <h2>Instantaneous Failure, Repair and Mobility Rates for Markov Reliability Systems: A Wind-Farm application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guglielmo D'Amico, Filippo Petroni</p>
            <p>The Rate of Occurrence of Failures (ROCOF) is a widely utilized indicator for assessing a system's performance over time, yet it does not fully disclose the instantaneous behavior of a system. This paper introduces new measures to complement the ROCOF, providing a more comprehensive understanding of system reliability, particularly for Markov systems. We define the Rate of Occurrence of Repairs (ROCOR), which quantifies the system's instantaneous tendency to transition from failure to working states, and the Rate of Inoccurrence (ROI), which measures the propensity to remain within the current subset of states (either working or failure) without transitioning out. Explicit expressions for the computation of these rates are derived for Markov systems. Furthermore, a Total Mobility Rate (TMR) is proposed, integrating these individual rates to capture the overall dynamism of the system. The utility of these new indicators is demonstrated through a significant real-world application to wind farm management. The results from the wind farm study show that ROCOR, ROI, and TMR, when used in conjunction with ROCOF, reveal nuanced operational dynamics and reliability characteristics that are not discernible from static measures like Weibull parameters or ROCOF alone. These indicators can distinguish between sites with similar long-term wind profiles by identifying different "reliability logics," such as persistence-driven versus transition-driven behaviors. This enriched, time-dependent perspective provides valuable information for maintenance scheduling, operational strategies, and risk assessment, ultimately enhancing the ability to manage complex systems effectively.</p>

            <h2>A Theoretical Framework for Virtual Power Plant Integration with Gigawatt-Scale AI Data Centers: Multi-Timescale Control and Stability Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Peivandizadeh</p>
            <p>The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale data centers that fundamentally challenge power system operation, exhibiting power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24 hours. We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000 MW/s at gigawatt scale. Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2) new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service availability above 99.95%. This work establishes the mathematical foundations necessary for the stable integration of AI infrastructure that will constitute 50-70% of data center electricity consumption by 2030.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Chouman (UGA, CSTB), Peter Riederer (CSTB), Frédéric Wurtz (UGA)</p>
            <p>Climate change poses a serious threat to the Earth's ecosystems, fueled primarily by escalating greenhouse gas emissions. Among the main contributors, the building sector stands out due to its significant energy demand. Addressing this challenge requires innovative techniques in the control of energy systems in buildings. This paper deals with the formulation of a methodology designed to evaluate the performance of these controllers. The evaluation process involves the establishment of a comprehensive test protocol and a diverse set of scenarios to evaluate the controllers. Key performance indicators are used to quantify their effectiveness based on the test results. A practical case study is presented as an application to introduce this methodology, focusing on the integration of Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs) with the Dimosim thermal simulation platform. The digital twin of the Greener building in Grenoble is used as a model for emulation. The paper demonstrates the ability of the proposed methodology to test and rank MPCs in different test scenarios, providing valuable feedback on their performance capabilities. The paper highlights the importance of the developed approach in systematically evaluating and ranking MPCs for optimized building energy management.</p>

            <h2>How flexible do we need to be? Using electricity systems models to identify optimal designs for flexible carbon capture storage system for gas-fired power plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangwei Cheng, Qian Luo, Jesse Jenkins</p>
            <p>As the share of variable renewable energy in power systems grows, enhancing the operational flexibility of combined cycle gas turbines with carbon capture and storage (CCGT-CCS) becomes increasingly valuable. This study integrates techno-economic analysis with capacity expansion modeling to quantify the value of improved CCGT-CCS flexibility-such as lower start-up costs, reduced minimum generation, faster ramping, and shorter up/down times-at both plant and system levels. Using the Texas power system as a case study, we find that increased flexibility raises CCGT-CCS generation profits and installed capacity. Under various policy scenarios, CCGT-CCS benefits most from a CO2 tax (or equivalent emissions cap), more so than from clean energy standards or capture subsidies like the federal 45Q tax credit. However, electricity system cost savings remain modest, reducing total costs by only 0.3-0.5%. Thus, flexibility improvements should be pursued only if they entail limited increases in capital and maintenance costs.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Chance Constrained Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shenglu Wang, Kairui Feng, Mengqi Xue, Yue Song</p>
            <p>The chance constrained optimal power flow (CC-OPF) essentially finds the low-cost generation dispatch scheme ensuring operational constraints are met with a specified probability, termed the security level. While the security level is a crucial input parameter, how it shapes the CC-OPF feasibility boundary has not been revealed. Changing the security level from a parameter to a decision variable, this letter proposes the inverse CC-OPF that seeks the highest feasible security level supported by the system. To efficiently solve this problem, we design a Newton-Raphson-like iteration algorithm leveraging the duality-based sensitivity analysis of an associated surrogate problem. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, revealing complex feasibility boundaries for security levels that underscore the importance of coordinating security levels across multiple chance constraints.</p>

            <h2>FICA: Faster Inner Convex Approximation of Chance Constrained Grid Dispatch with Decision-Coupled Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihong Zhou, Hanbin Yang, Thomas Morstyn</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a Faster Inner Convex Approximation (FICA) method for solving power system dispatch problems with Wasserstein distributionally robust joint chance constraints (WJCC) and incorporating the modelling of the automatic generation control factors. The problem studied belongs to the computationally challenging class of WJCC with left-hand-side uncertainty (LHS-WJCC). By exploiting the special one-dimensional structure (even if only partially present) of the problem, the proposed FICA incorporates a set of strong valid inequalities to accelerate the solution process. We prove that FICA achieves the same optimality as the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) inner convex approximation method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed FICA can yield 40x computational speedup compared to CVaR, and can even reach up to 500x speedup when the optimisation horizon exceeds 16 time steps. This speedup is achieved when only 50% of constraints in a WJCC have the one-dimensional structure. The approximation quality is numerically verified to be the same as CVaR, and the quality gap is below 1% when compared to the computationally demanding exact reformulation of the LHS-WJCC in most cases. We also discuss the applications of FICA in optimisation problems from other domains that (partially) exhibit the one-dimensional structure.</p>

            <h2>Auto-Lesion Segmentation with a Novel Intensity Dark Channel Prior for COVID-19 Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Basma Jumaa Saleh, Zaid Omar, Vikrant Bhateja, Lila Iznita Izhar</p>
            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical imaging techniques like computed tomography (CT) scans have demonstrated effectiveness in combating the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct research on computerized models for the detection of COVID-19 using CT imaging. A novel processing method has been developed, utilizing radiomic features, to assist in the CT-based diagnosis of COVID-19. Given the lower specificity of traditional features in distinguishing between different causes of pulmonary diseases, the objective of this study is to develop a CT-based radiomics framework for the differentiation of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. The model is designed to focus on outlining COVID-19 lesions, as traditional features often lack specificity in this aspect. The model categorizes images into three classes: COVID-19, non-COVID-19, or normal. It employs enhancement auto-segmentation principles using intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) and deep neural networks (ALS-IDCP-DNN) within a defined range of analysis thresholds. A publicly available dataset comprising COVID-19, normal, and non-COVID-19 classes was utilized to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. The best performing classification model, Residual Neural Network with 50 layers (Resnet-50), attained an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 98.8%, 99%, 98%, and 98% respectively. These results demonstrate the capability of our model to accurately classify COVID-19 images, which could aid radiologists in diagnosing suspected COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, our model's performance surpasses that of more than 10 current state-of-the-art studies conducted on the same dataset.</p>

            <p>Fuel cell (FC)/battery hybrid systems have attracted substantial attention for achieving zero-emissions buses, trucks, ships, and planes. An online energy management system (EMS) is essential for these hybrid systems, it controls energy flow and ensures optimal system performance. Key aspects include fuel efficiency and mitigating FC and battery degradation. This paper proposes a health-aware EMS for FC and battery hybrid systems with multiple FC stacks. The proposed EMS employs mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) to control each FC stack in the hybrid system independently, i.e., MIQP-based individual stack control (ISC), with significant fuel cost reductions, FC and battery degradations. The proposed method is compared with classical dynamic programming (DP), with a 2243 times faster computational speed than the DP method while maintaining nearoptimal performance. The case study results show that ISC achieves a 64.68 % total cost reduction compared to CSC in the examined scenario, with substantial reductions across key metrics including battery degradation (4 %), hydrogen fuel consumption (22 %), fuel cell idling loss (99 %), and fuel cell load-change loss (41 %)</p>

            <h2>Nonparametric Steady-State Learning for Nonlinear Output Feedback Regulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shimin Wang, Martin Guay, Richard D. Braatz</p>
            <p>This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the proposed nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization formulation for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics. This approach removes the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semi-definite derivatives and avoids the common assumption of linear parameterization of the nonlinear system. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be tackled using a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous to guarantee the convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.</p>

We propose a novel vehicle-based algorithm architecture and adapt the critic's loss function to appropriately consider coordinated actions. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm to incorporate rebalancing capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by up to 12.9% for dispatching and up to 38.9% with integrated rebalancing.</p>

            <p>Deep learning-based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have focused on generating high-quality images but often overlook the impact on downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images. Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation and the domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream task-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single downstream task. In this work, we extend the optimization to handle multiple downstream tasks that are introduced sequentially via continual learning. The proposed method integrates techniques from replay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that our method outperformed a reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with naïve finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods.

            <h2>Radio Map Prediction from Aerial Images and Application to Coverage Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Jaensch, Giuseppe Caire, Begüm Demir</p>
            <p>Several studies have explored deep learning algorithms to predict large-scale signal fading, or path loss, in urban communication networks. The goal is to replace costly measurement campaigns, inaccurate statistical models, or computationally expensive ray-tracing simulations with machine learning models that deliver quick and accurate predictions. We focus on predicting path loss radio maps using convolutional neural networks, leveraging aerial images alone or in combination with supplementary height information. Notably, our approach does not rely on explicit classification of environmental objects, which is often unavailable for most locations worldwide. While the prediction of radio maps using complete 3D environmental data is well-studied, the use of only aerial images remains under-explored. We address this gap by showing that state-of-the-art models developed for existing radio map datasets can be effectively adapted to this task. Additionally, we introduce a new model dubbed UNetDCN that achieves on par or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art with reduced complexity. The trained models are differentiable, and therefore they can be incorporated in various network optimization algorithms. While an extensive discussion is beyond this paper's scope, we demonstrate this through an example optimizing the directivity of base stations in cellular networks via backpropagation to enhance coverage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Le Xia, Yao Sun, Haijian Sun, Rose Qingyang Hu, Dusit Niyato, Muhammad Ali Imran</p>
            <p>Semantic communication (SemCom) has been recently deemed a promising next-generation wireless technique to enable efficient spectrum savings and information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical network paradigm where cellular and device-to-device (D2D) SemCom approaches coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes complicated and challenging due to the unique semantic performance measurements and energy-consuming semantic coding mechanism. To this end, this paper jointly investigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D SemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware semantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to identify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we define the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction with basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy efficiency (semantics/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency maximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several SemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem transformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with theoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our proposed solution compared with different benchmarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Li, Jing Li, Zhanyu Ju, Fengkui Gong, Lu Lv</p>
            <p>We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol. Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under low signal-to noise ratio situations. Besides, a segmented energy refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the evaluation metrics by 2.27\% compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual environment. Besides, the broadcast frame decoding results indicate that 97.30\% accuracy of RID has been achieved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Mashaal, Hatem Abou-Zeid</p>
            <p>Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification, angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations, such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data, achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification, respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves 94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs. 96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep reinforcement learning-based joint real-time energy scheduling for green buildings with heterogeneous battery energy storage devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Liu, Zhezhuang Xu, Jiawei Zhou, Yazhou Yuan, Kai Ma, Meng Yuan</p>
            <p>Green buildings (GBs) with renewable energy and building energy management systems (BEMS) enable efficient energy use and support sustainable development. Electric vehicles (EVs), as flexible storage resources, enhance system flexibility when integrated with stationary energy storage systems (ESS) for real-time scheduling. However, differing degradation and operational characteristics of ESS and EVs complicate scheduling strategies. This paper proposes a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for joint real-time scheduling based on a combined battery system (CBS) integrating ESS and EVs. We develop accurate degradation models and cost estimates, prioritize EV travel demands, and enable collaborative ESS-EV operation under varying conditions. A prediction model optimizes energy interaction between CBS and BEMS. To address heterogeneous states, action coupling, and learning efficiency, the DRL algorithm incorporates double networks, a dueling mechanism, and prioritized experience replay. Experiments show a 37.94 percent to 40.01 percent reduction in operating costs compared to a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach.</p>

            <h2>SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenyu Yang, Shuai Wang, Hangting Chen, Wei Tan, Jianwei Yu, Haizhou Li</p>
            <p>Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Pan, Yuguang Yang, Yanni Hu, Jianhao Ye, Xiang Zhang, Hongbin Zhou, Lei Ma, Jianjun Zhao</p>
            <p>Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert spoken utterances from multiple source languages into fluent and intelligible speech in a target language. Despite recent progress, several critical challenges persist: 1) achieving high-quality S2ST remains a significant obstacle; 2) most existing S2ST methods rely heavily on large-scale parallel speech corpora, which are difficult and resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce S2ST-Omni, a novel, efficient, and scalable framework tailored for multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Specifically, we decompose S2ST into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). To enable high-quality S2TT while mitigating reliance on large-scale parallel speech corpora, we leverage powerful pretrained models: Whisper for robust audio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text comprehension. A lightweight speech adapter is introduced to bridge the modality gap between speech and text representations, facilitating effective utilization of pretrained multimodal knowledge. To ensure both translation accuracy and real-time responsiveness, we adopt a streaming speech generation model in the TTS stage, which generates the target speech in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments conducted on the CVSS benchmark demonstrate that S2ST-Omni consistently surpasses several state-of-the-art S2ST baselines in translation quality, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</p>

            <p>Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design. Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part I: Noise-Aware Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed Razavikia, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>Over-the-air computation (OAC) leverages the physical superposition property of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute functions while communication occurs, enabling scalable and low-latency processing in distributed networks. While analog OAC methods suffer from noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, existing digital approaches are often limited in design complexity, which may hinder scalability and fail to exploit spectral efficiency fully. This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp framework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued functions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation design approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the encoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance metrics. Our design supports noise models, including Gaussian, Laplace, and heavy-tailed distributions. We further demonstrate that, for heavy-tailed noise, the optimal ChannelComp setup coincides with the solution to the corresponding max-min criterion for the channel noise with heavy-tailed distributions. Numerical experiments confirm that our noise-aware design achieves a substantially lower mean-square error than leading digital OAC methods over noisy MACs. In Part II, we consider a constellation design with a quantization-based sampling scheme to enhance modulation scalability and computational accuracy for large-scale digital OAC.</p>

            <h2>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part II: Pyramid Sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed Razavikia, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>Over-the-air computation (OAC) harnesses the natural superposition of wireless signals to compute aggregate functions during transmission, thereby collapsing communication and computation into a single step and significantly reducing latency and resource usage. In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a noise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min optimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed constellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function outputs. In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and quantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for large-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling strategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points to reduce the encoder design complexity from $\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to $\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\in\{1,\dots, K\}$ denotes the sampling order, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the network. Under the assumption of symmetric aggregation, this approach enables a controlled trade-off between computational complexity and function computation accuracy. As a special case, we propose majority-based sampling ($p=K$), which confines aggregation to only $q$ consensus points, inherently avoiding destructive overlaps and permitting the use of standard digital modulations (e.g., QAM, PSK, ASK) without bespoke constellation designs. We also show via several simulations, across various aggregation functions, modulation levels, and noise levels, that moderate sampling orders attain acceptable performance with orders-of-magnitude fewer constraints than exhaustive designs.</p>

            <p>Enhancing the sustainability and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in dynamic and unpredictable environments requires adaptive communication and energy harvesting strategies. We propose a novel adaptive control strategy for WSNs that optimizes data transmission and EH to minimize overall energy consumption while ensuring queue stability and energy storing constraints under dynamic environmental conditions. The notion of adaptability therein is achieved by transferring the known environment-specific knowledge to new conditions resorting to the lifelong reinforcement learning concepts. We evaluate our proposed method against two baseline frameworks: Lyapunov-based optimization, and policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL). Simulation results demonstrate that our approach rapidly adapts to changing environmental conditions by leveraging transferable knowledge, achieving near-optimal performance approximately $30\%$ faster than the RL method and $60\%$ faster than the Lyapunov-based approach.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fang Chen, Weifeng Zhang, Xingyu Ai, BingXuan Li, An Li, Qiegen Liu</p>
            <p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used to assess metabolic activity, but its application is limited by the availability of radiotracers. 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast, 6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, the complexity of its synthesis process and constraints on transportation time have limited its clinical application. Among different forms of raw data acquired by the scanner, sinogram is a commonly used representation in PET imaging. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the accumulation errors during the image reconstruction process. Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET sinograms into 18F-DOPA PET sinograms. During inference, an initial synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is first generated using a higher-order hybrid sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition to guide the iterative refinement process. Experimental results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and the final synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Novel Multicolumn Kernel Extreme Learning Machine for Food Detection via Optimal Features from CNN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ghalib Ahmed Tahir, Chu Kiong Loo</p>
            <p>Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide array of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media platforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment apps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority of our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of 'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets.</p>

            <h2>A model predictive control framework with robust stability guarantees under large disturbances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Köhler, Melanie N. Zeilinger</p>
            <p>To address feasibility issues in model predictive control (MPC), most implementations relax state constraints by using slack variables and adding a penalty to the cost. We propose an alternative strategy: relaxing the initial state constraint with a penalty. Compared to state-of-the-art soft constrained MPC formulations, the proposed formulation has two key features: (i) input-to-state stability and bounds on the cumulative constraint violation for large disturbances; (ii) close-to-optimal performance under nominal operating conditions. The idea is initially presented for open-loop asymptotically stable nonlinear systems by designing the penalty as a Lyapunov function, but we also show how to relax this condition to: i) Lyapunov stable systems; ii) stabilizable systems; and iii) utilizing an implicit characterization of the Lyapunov function. In the special case of linear systems, the proposed MPC formulation reduces to a quadratic program, and the offline design and online computational complexity are only marginally increased compared to a nominal design. Numerical examples demonstrate benefits compared to state-of-the-art soft-constrained MPC formulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Wagner, Ilja Baumann, Tobias Bocklet</p>
            <p>Cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks have been widely used in non-parallel voice conversion (VC). Their ability to learn mappings between source and target features without relying on parallel training data eliminates the need for temporal alignments. However, most methods decouple the conversion of acoustic features from synthesizing the audio signal by using separate models for conversion and waveform synthesis. This work unifies conversion and synthesis into a single model, thereby eliminating the need for a separate vocoder. By leveraging cycle-consistent training and a self-supervised auxiliary training task, our model is able to efficiently generate converted high-quality raw audio waveforms. Subjective listening tests showed that our unified approach achieved improvements of up to 6.7% relative to the baseline in whispered VC. Mean opinion score predictions also yielded stable results in conventional VC (between 0.5% and 2.4% relative improvement).</p>

            <p>This study explores distributed optimization problems with clique-wise coupling via operator splitting and how we can utilize this framework for performance analysis and enhancement. This framework extends beyond conventional pairwise coupled problems (e.g., consensus optimization) and is applicable to broader examples. To this end, we first introduce a new distributed optimization algorithm by leveraging a clique-based matrix and the Davis-Yin splitting (DYS), a versatile three-operator splitting method. We then demonstrate that this approach sheds new light on conventional algorithms in the following way: (i) Existing algorithms (NIDS, Exact diffusion, diffusion, and our previous work) can be derived from our proposed method; (ii) We present a new mixing matrix based on clique-wise coupling, which surfaces when deriving the NIDS. We prove its preferable distribution of eigenvalues, enabling fast consensus; (iii) These observations yield a new linear convergence rate for the NIDS with non-smooth objective functions. Remarkably our linear rate is first established for the general DYS with a projection for a subspace. This case is not covered by any prior results, to our knowledge. Finally, numerical examples showcase the efficacy of our proposed approach.</p>

            <p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) is used for diagnosis and risk stratification following myocardial infarction (MI). Women have a higher incidence of missed MI diagnosis and complications following infarction, and to address this we aim to provide quantitative information on sex-differences in ECG and torso-ventricular anatomy features. A novel computational automated pipeline is presented enabling the three-dimensional reconstruction of torso-ventricular anatomies for 425 post-MI subjects and 1051 healthy controls from UK Biobank clinical images. Regression models were created relating torso-ventricular and ECG parameters. For post-MI women, the heart is positioned more posteriorly and vertically, than in men (with healthy women yet more vertical). Post-MI women exhibit less QRS prolongation, requiring 27% more prolongation than men to exceed 120ms. Only half of the sex difference in QRS is associated with smaller female cavities. Lower STj amplitude in women is striking, associated with smaller ventricles, but also more superior and posterior cardiac position. Post-MI, T wave amplitude and R axis deviations are strongly associated with a more posterior and horizontal cardiac position in women (but not in men). Our study highlights the need to quantify sex differences in anatomical features, their implications in ECG interpretation, and the application of clinical ECG thresholds in post-MI.</p>

            <p>The networked nature of multi-robot systems presents challenges in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Centralized control policies do not scale with increasing numbers of robots, whereas independent control policies do not exploit the information provided by other robots, exhibiting poor performance in cooperative-competitive tasks. In this work we propose a physics-informed reinforcement learning approach able to learn distributed multi-robot control policies that are both scalable and make use of all the available information to each robot. Our approach has three key characteristics. First, it imposes a port-Hamiltonian structure on the policy representation, respecting energy conservation properties of physical robot systems and the networked nature of robot team interactions. Second, it uses self-attention to ensure a sparse policy representation able to handle time-varying information at each robot from the interaction graph. Third, we present a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm parameterized by our self-attention port-Hamiltonian control policy, which accounts for the correlation among robots during training while overcoming the need of value function factorization. Extensive simulations in different multi-robot scenarios demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, surpassing previous multi-robot reinforcement learning solutions in scalability, while achieving similar or superior performance (with averaged cumulative reward up to x2 greater than the state-of-the-art with robot teams x6 larger than the number of robots at training time). We also validate our approach on multiple real robots in the Georgia Tech Robotarium under imperfect communication, demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and scalability across number of robots.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Zhang, Xuanyu Cao, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>Federated learning (FL) necessitates that edge devices conduct local training and communicate with a parameter server, resulting in significant energy consumption. A key challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which limits their operational lifespan and impacts learning performance. To tackle this issue, we implement energy harvesting techniques in FL systems to capture ambient energy, thereby providing continuous power to edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is affected by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

            <p>The number of possible melodies is unfathomably large, yet despite this virtually unlimited potential for melodic variation, melodies from different societies can be surprisingly similar. The motor constraint hypothesis accounts for certain similarities, such as scalar motion and contour shape, but not for other major common features, such as repetition, song length, and scale size. Here we investigate the role of information constraints in shaping these hallmarks of melodies. We measure determinants of information rate in 62 corpora of Folk melodies spanning several continents, finding multiple trade-offs that all act to constrain the information rate across societies. By contrast, 39 corpora of Art music from Europe (including Turkey) show longer, more complex melodies, and increased complexity over time, suggesting different cultural-evolutionary selection pressures in Art and Folk music, possibly due to the use of written versus oral transmission. Our parameter-free model predicts the empirical scale degree distribution using information constraints on scalar motion, melody length, and, most importantly, information rate. These results provide strong evidence that information constraints during cultural transmission of music limit the number of notes in a scale, and suggests that a tendency for intermediate melodic complexity reflects a fundamental constraint on the cultural evolution of melody.</p>

Firstly, we illustrate the wireless and daylight system models of RIS-aided O2I networks and formulate a joint optimization problem to enhance both wireless traffic sum rate and daylight illumination performance. Then, we present a multi-modal LLM-based window optimization (LMWO) framework, accompanied by a prompt construction template to optimize the overall performance in a zero-shot fashion, functioning as both an architect and a wireless network planner. Finally, we analyze the optimization performance of the LMWO framework and the impact of the number of windows, room size, number of RIS units, and daylight factor. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LMWO framework can achieve outstanding optimization performance in terms of initial performance, convergence speed, final outcomes, and time complexity, compared with classic optimization methods. The building's wireless performance can be significantly enhanced while ensuring indoor daylight performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Mehdizavareh, Arijit Khan, Simon Lebech Cichosz</p>
            <p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p>

            <p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p>

We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical Control of Emotion Rendering in Speech Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sho Inoue, Kun Zhou, Shuai Wang, Haizhou Li</p>
            <p>Emotional text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) aims to generate realistic emotional speech from input text. However, quantitatively controlling multi-level emotion rendering remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a flow-matching based emotional TTS framework with a novel approach for emotion intensity modeling to facilitate fine-grained control over emotion rendering at the phoneme, word, and utterance levels. We introduce a hierarchical emotion distribution (ED) extractor that captures a quantifiable ED embedding across different speech segment levels. Additionally, we explore various acoustic features and assess their impact on emotion intensity modeling. During TTS training, the hierarchical ED embedding effectively captures the variance in emotion intensity from the reference audio and correlates it with linguistic and speaker information. The TTS model not only generates emotional speech during inference, but also quantitatively controls the emotion rendering over the speech constituents. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in terms of speech quality, emotional expressiveness, and hierarchical emotion control.</p>

            <h2>A Linear Parameter-Varying Framework for the Analysis of Time-Varying Optimization Algorithms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Jakob, Andrea Iannelli</p>
            <p>In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order optimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that the temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the objective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future values are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients under a convex constraint set. We model the algorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback with monotone operators such as the time-varying gradient. We leverage the approach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the time-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the behavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV literature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an input-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which increases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from results in this research area, our bounds introduce a dependence on different additional measures of temporal variations, such as the function value and gradient rate of change. We exemplify our main results with numerical experiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture convergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying optimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.</p>

            <p>We introduce AnyEnhance, a unified generative model for voice enhancement that processes both speech and singing voices. Based on a masked generative model, AnyEnhance is capable of handling both speech and singing voices, supporting a wide range of enhancement tasks including denoising, dereverberation, declipping, super-resolution, and target speaker extraction, all simultaneously and without fine-tuning. AnyEnhance introduces a prompt-guidance mechanism for in-context learning, which allows the model to natively accept a reference speaker's timbre. In this way, it could boost enhancement performance when a reference audio is available and enable the target speaker extraction task without altering the underlying architecture. Moreover, we also introduce a self-critic mechanism into the generative process for masked generative models, yielding higher-quality outputs through iterative self-assessment and refinement. Extensive experiments on various enhancement tasks demonstrate AnyEnhance outperforms existing methods in terms of both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

            <p>Estimating the state of biological specimens is challenging due to limited observation through microscopic vision. For instance, during mouse skull drilling, the appearance alters little when thinning bone tissue because of its semi-transparent property and the high-magnification microscopic vision. To obtain the object's state, we introduce an object state estimation method for biological specimens through active interaction based on the deflection. The method is integrated to enhance the autonomous drilling system developed in our previous work. The method and integrated system were evaluated through 12 autonomous eggshell drilling experiment trials. The results show that the system achieved a 91.7% successful ratio and 75% detachable ratio, showcasing its potential applicability in more complex surgical procedures such as mouse skull craniotomy. This research paves the way for further development of autonomous robotic systems capable of estimating the object's state through active interaction.</p>

EmoAgent explicitly decomposes the manipulation process into three specialized phases executed by collaborative agents: a Planning Agent that generates diverse emotional editing strategies, an Editing Agent that precisely executes these strategies, and a Critic Agent that iteratively refines the results to ensure emotional accuracy. This collaborative design empowers EmoAgent to model \emph{one-to-many} emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling semantically diverse and emotionally faithful this http URL quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that EmoAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, effectively generating multiple distinct visual edits that convey the same target emotion.</p>

            <p>Virtual reality (VR) presents immersive opportunities across many applications, yet the inherent risk of developing cybersickness during interaction can severely reduce enjoyment and platform adoption. Cybersickness is marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work primarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and motion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the \emph{dynamic nature} of cybersickness while users experience and freely interact in VR. We propose a novel method to \emph{continuously} identify and quantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users' \emph{passively monitored} electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method estimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing techniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels in real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific calibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses the considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness research.</p>

            <p>Proper recitation of the Quran, adhering to the rules of Tajweed, is crucial for preventing mistakes during recitation and requires significant effort to master. Traditional methods of teaching these rules are limited by the availability of qualified instructors and time constraints. Automatic evaluation of recitation can address these challenges by providing prompt feedback and supporting independent practice. This study focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify three Tajweed rules - separate stretching (Al Mad), tight noon (Ghunnah), and hide (Ikhfaa) - using the publicly available QDAT dataset, which contains over 1,500 audio recordings. The input data consisted of audio recordings from this dataset, transformed into normalized mel-spectrograms. For classification, the EfficientNet-B0 architecture was used, enhanced with a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. The developed model achieved accuracy rates of 95.35%, 99.34%, and 97.01% for the respective rules. An analysis of the learning curves confirmed the model's robustness and absence of overfitting. The proposed approach demonstrates high efficiency and paves the way for developing interactive educational systems for Tajweed study.</p>

            <h2>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Xianbin Wang, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</p>

The Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (VtaD) 2025 challenge focuses on explaining the voice timbre attribute in a comparative manner. In this challenge, the human impression of voice timbre is verbalized with a set of sensory descriptors, including bright, coarse, soft, magnetic, and so on. The timbre is explained from the comparison between two voices in their intensity within a specific descriptor dimension. The VtaD 2025 challenge starts in May and culminates in a special proposal at the NCMMSC2025 conference in October 2025 in Zhenjiang, China.</p>

In this task, voice timbre is explained with a set of sensory attributes describing its human perception. A pair of speech utterances is processed, and their intensity is compared in a designated timbre descriptor. Moreover, a framework is proposed, which is built upon the speaker embeddings extracted from the speech utterances. The investigation is conducted on the VCTK-RVA dataset. Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2) the FACodec speaker encoder was superior in the unseen scenario, where the testing speakers were not part of the training, indicating enhanced generalization capability.

            <p>Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous' methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.</p>

            <p>Due to the lack of target speech annotations in real-recorded far-field conversational datasets, speech enhancement (SE) models are typically trained on simulated data. However, the trained models often perform poorly in real-world conditions, hindering their application in far-field speech recognition. To address the issue, we (a) propose direct sound estimation (DSE) to estimate the oracle direct sound of real-recorded data for SE; and (b) present a novel pseudo-supervised learning method, SuPseudo, which leverages DSE-estimates as pseudo-labels and enables SE models to directly learn from and adapt to real-recorded data, thereby improving their generalization capability. Furthermore, an SE model called FARNET is designed to fully utilize SuPseudo. Experiments on the MISP2023 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of SuPseudo, and our system significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.

            <p>Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling, which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.</p>

            <p>Event-based eye tracking holds significant promise for fine-grained cognitive state inference, offering high temporal resolution and robustness to motion artifacts, critical features for decoding subtle mental states such as attention, confusion, or fatigue. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic, inference-time refinement framework designed to enhance the output of existing event-based gaze estimation models without modifying their architecture or requiring retraining. Our method comprises two key post-processing modules: (i) Motion-Aware Median Filtering, which suppresses blink-induced spikes while preserving natural gaze dynamics, and (ii) Optical Flow-Based Local Refinement, which aligns gaze predictions with cumulative event motion to reduce spatial jitter and temporal discontinuities. To complement traditional spatial accuracy metrics, we propose a novel Jitter Metric that captures the temporal smoothness of predicted gaze trajectories based on velocity regularity and local signal complexity. Together, these contributions significantly improve the consistency of event-based gaze signals, making them better suited for downstream tasks such as micro-expression analysis and mind-state decoding. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple baseline models on controlled datasets, laying the groundwork for future integration with multimodal affect recognition systems in real-world environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu, Selene Ledain, Helge Aasen</p>
            <p>Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons, where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD), based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time. By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain, the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically, produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaolei Zhang, Shoutao Guo, Qingkai Fang, Yan Zhou, Yang Feng</p>
            <p>The emergence of GPT-4o-like large multimodal models (LMMs) has raised the exploration of integrating text, vision, and speech modalities to support more flexible multimodal interaction. Existing LMMs typically concatenate representation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a large language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is straightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on large-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model the relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more efficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose Stream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality alignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various modality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the vision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is semantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension concatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically consistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension mapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve modality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer of text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual understanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction tasks. Owing to the layer-dimensional mapping, Stream-Omni can simultaneously provide intermediate text outputs (such as ASR transcriptions and model responses) during speech interaction, offering users a comprehensive multimodal experience.</p>

            <p>An oligopoly is a market in which the price of a goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.</p>

            <p>Fully re-orientable small spacecraft are now supported by commercial technologies, allowing them to point their instruments in any direction and capture images, with short notice. When combined with improved onboard processing, and implemented on a constellation of inter-communicable satellites, this intelligent agility can significantly increase responsiveness to transient or evolving phenomena. We demonstrate a ground-based and onboard algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control, inter-satellite communication, intelligent prediction and planning to schedule the time-varying, re-orientation of agile, small satellites in a constellation. Planner intelligence is improved by updating the predictive value of future space-time observations based on shared observations of evolving episodic precipitation and urban flood forecasts. Reliable inter-satellite communication within a fast, dynamic constellation topology is modeled in the physical, access control and network layer. We apply the framework on a representative 24-satellite constellation observing 5 global regions. Results show appropriately low latency in information exchange (average within 1/3rd available time for implicit consensus), enabling the onboard scheduler to observe ~7% more flood magnitude than a ground-based implementation. Both onboard and offline versions performed ~98% better than constellations without agility.</p>

            <h2>Pixel-wise Modulated Dice Loss for Medical Image Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Mohsen Hosseini</p>
            <p>Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance. Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous Trajectory Optimization for UAVs in Disaster Zone Using Henry Gas Optimization Scheme</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zakria Qadir, Muhammad Bilal, Guoqiang Liu, Xiaolong Xu</p>
            <p>The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a disaster-prone environment plays important role in assisting the rescue services and providing the internet connectivity with the outside world. However, in such a complex environment the selection of optimum trajectory of UAVs is of utmost importance. UAV trajectory optimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time. In this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry gas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path having minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical model is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and barnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the proposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient environment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex environment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO algorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8% reduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the HGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in smart cities.</p>

            <h2>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part I: Noise-Aware Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed Razavikia, Carlo Fischione</p>
            <p>Over-the-air computation (OAC) leverages the physical superposition property of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute functions while communication occurs, enabling scalable and low-latency processing in distributed networks. While analog OAC methods suffer from noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, existing digital approaches are often limited in design complexity, which may hinder scalability and fail to exploit spectral efficiency fully. This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp framework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued functions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation design approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the encoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance metrics. Our design supports noise models, including Gaussian, Laplace, and heavy-tailed distributions. We further demonstrate that, for heavy-tailed noise, the optimal ChannelComp setup coincides with the solution to the corresponding max-min criterion for the channel noise with heavy-tailed distributions. Numerical experiments confirm that our noise-aware design achieves a substantially lower mean-square error than leading digital OAC methods over noisy MACs. In Part II, we consider a constellation design with a quantization-based sampling scheme to enhance modulation scalability and computational accuracy for large-scale digital OAC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyang Miao, Jianhua Zhang, Pan Tang, Heng Wang, Lei Tian, Guangyi Liu</p>
            <p>With the increase of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) array size and carrier frequency, near-field MIMO communications will become crucial in 6G wireless networks. Due to the increase of MIMO near-field range, the research of near-field MIMO capacity has aroused wide interest. In this paper, we focus on the theoretical analysis and empirical study of near-field MIMO capacity. First, the near-field channel model is characterized from the electromagnetic information perspective. Second, with the uniform planar array (UPA), the channel capacity based on effective degree of freedom (EDoF) is analyzed theoretically, and the closed-form analytical expressions are derived in detail. Finally, based on the numerical verification of near-field channel measurement experiment at 13 GHz band, we reveal that the channel capacity of UPA-type MIMO systems decreases continuously with the communication distance increasing. It can be observed that the near-field channel capacity gain is relatively obvious when large-scale MIMO is adopted at both receiving and transmitter ends, but the near-field channel capacity gain may be limited in the actual communication system with the small antenna array at receiving end. This work will give some reference to the near-field communication systems.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting Both Pilots and Data Payloads for Integrated Sensing and Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Xu, Xianghao Yu, Fan Liu, Shi Jin</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is one of the key enabling technologies in future sixth-generation (6G) networks. Current ISAC systems predominantly rely on deterministic pilot signals within the signal frame to accomplish sensing tasks. However, these pilot signals typically occupy only a small portion, e.g., 0.15% to 25%, of the time-frequency resources. To enhance the system utility, a promising solution is to repurpose the extensive random data payload signals for sensing tasks. In this paper, we analyze the ISAC performance of a multi-antenna system where both deterministic pilot and random data symbols are employed for sensing tasks. By capitalizing on random matrix theory (RMT), we first derive a semi-closed-form asymptotic expression of the ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE). Then, we formulate an ISAC precoding optimization problem to minimize the ELMMSE, which is solved via a specifically tailored successive convex approximation (SAC) algorithm. To provide system insights, we further derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic ELMMSE at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis reveals that, compared with conventional sensing implemented by deterministic signals, the sensing performance degradation induced by random signals is critically determined by the ratio of the transmit antenna size to the data symbol length. Based on this result, the ISAC precoding optimization problem at high SNRs is transformed into a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived asymptotic expressions of ELMMSE and the performance of the proposed precoding schemes. Particularly, by leveraging data payload signals for sensing tasks, the sensing error is reduced by up to 5.6 dB compared to conventional pilot-based sensing.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Domain Optimization Framework for ISAC: From Electromagnetic Shaping to Network Cooperation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rang Liu, Ming Li, Mehdi Zafari, Bjorn Ottersten, A. Lee Swindlehurst</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key feature for sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing an opportunity to meet the dual demands of communication and sensing. Existing ISAC research primarily focuses on baseband optimization at individual access points, with limited attention to the roles of electromagnetic (EM) shaping and network-wide coordination. The intricate interdependencies between these domains remain insufficiently explored, leaving their full potential for enhancing ISAC performance largely untapped. To bridge this gap, we consider multi-domain ISAC optimization integrating EM shaping, baseband processing, and network cooperation strategies that facilitate efficient resource management and system-level design. We analyze the fundamental trade-offs between these domains and offer insights into domain-specific and cross-domain strategies contributing to ISAC performance and efficiency. We then conduct a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of joint multi-domain optimization. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions to connect theoretical advancements and practical ISAC deployments. This work paves the way for intelligent and scalable ISAC architectures, providing critical insights for their seamless integration into next-generation wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun Liu, Xiaobin Wu, Jiaqi He, Rajan Das Gupta</p>
            <p>This study explores the effectiveness of predictive maintenance models and the optimization of intelligent Operation and Maintenance (O&M) systems in improving wind power generation efficiency. Through qualitative research, structured interviews were conducted with five wind farm engineers and maintenance managers, each with extensive experience in turbine operations. Using thematic analysis, the study revealed that while predictive maintenance models effectively reduce downtime by identifying major faults, they often struggle with detecting smaller, gradual failures. Key challenges identified include false positives, sensor malfunctions, and difficulties in integrating new models with older turbine systems. Advanced technologies such as digital twins, SCADA systems, and condition monitoring have significantly enhanced turbine maintenance practices. However, these technologies still require improvements, particularly in AI refinement and real-time data integration. The findings emphasize the need for continuous development to fully optimize wind turbine performance and support the broader adoption of renewable energy.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a detailed small-signal stability analysis of a modified version of the Cigré European high-voltage network, where one of the synchronous generators is replaced by a grid-following inverter-based resource (IBR). The analysis focuses on the influence of the parameters defining the grid-following IBR control scheme on the stability of the system. Given a set of potential grid configurations and the value of the IBR control parameters, stability is verified by the direct eigenvalue analysis of a high-detailed linearized model of the overall Cigré network. Starting from this procedure, we propose an adaptive sampling method for training a support vector machine classifier able to estimate the probability of stability of the power system over a domain defined by candidate intervals of the considered parameters. The training of the classifier is refined to identify with more accuracy the boundaries of the parameters' stability regions. The obtained results are then compared with those obtained by representing the grid with the classical Thévenin equivalent. Results suggest that, when the Thévenin equivalent is accurate, the predicted stability region is conservative yet contained within that of the full network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haotian Yao, Vahid Hakimian, Mostafa Farrokhabadi, Hamidreza Zareipour</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of this century, there has been a growing body of research and developments supporting the participation of energy storage systems (ESS) in the emission reduction mandates. However, regardless of these efforts and despite the need for an accelerated energy transition, we have yet to see a practical framework for operational carbon accounting and credit trading for energy storage systems. In this context, this paper proposes an emission performance credits (EPCs) framework that allows ESS, down to the prosumer level, to participate in the carbon market. Thus, a mechanism is proposed, for the first time, to calculate the grid's real-time marginal emission intensity (MEI). The MEI is then used to optimize the cumulative operational emission of ESS through carbon-aware dispatch. Consequently, the framework tracks the operational emissions and converts them into EPCs, which are then sold to regulated entities under compliance programs. Simulation results support the potential of ESS, regardless of their size, to participate in the broader carbon mitigation objectives.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a universal power synchronization controller for grid-side control of the wind turbine conversion systems in an offshore wind farm with a diode rectifier in the offshore substation of the HVDC link. The controller incorporates voltage-power droop controllers in the outer loop to enable the operation of this setup. To effectively handle the impact of large delays during black start and power ramp phases, virtual active and reactive power quantities are defined. These quantities are computed based on the current references prior to any modifications that might be needed to meet converter current and voltage limits or source constraints. Utilizing them in the outer loop ensures a balanced power sharing and a stable operation whenever the original (unmodified) current references are not realized. Case studies confirm the robustness of the proposed controller.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the synergistic potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to enhance the energy efficiency and performance of next-generation wireless networks. We delve into the design of energy-efficient passive beamforming (PBF) strategies within RIS-assisted coordinated multi-point (CoMP)-NOMA networks. Two distinct RIS configurations, namely, enhancement-only PBF (EO) and enhancement & cancellation PBF (EC), are proposed and analyzed. Our findings demonstrate that RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks offer significant efficiency gains compared to traditional CoMP-NOMA systems. Furthermore, we formulate a PBF design problem to optimize the RIS phase shifts for maximizing energy efficiency. Our results reveal that the optimal PBF design is contingent upon several factors, including the number of cooperating base stations (BSs), the number of RIS elements deployed, and the RIS configuration. This study underscores the potential of RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks as a promising solution for achieving superior energy efficiency and overall performance in future wireless networks.</p>

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of IRSs-aided THz communications, covering hardware designs, advanced signal processing techniques, and practical deployment strategies. It first examines key THz reconfigurable metasurface architectures, including electronic, optical, phase-change material, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based implementations, highlighting their reconfiguration mechanisms and challenges. Then, fundamental effects including near field and beam squint in wideband THz systems are analyzed, along with their impacts on system performance. The paper further explores conventional and beam-squint-assisted channel estimation methods, innovative beam management strategies, and deployment considerations across large- and small-scale scenarios. Practical experiments at 220 gigahertz (GHz) validate the effectiveness of IRS in improving signal strength and communication reliability for both single-user and multi-user setups.</p>

            <p>Adaptive track initiation remains a crucial component of many modern multi-target tracking systems. For labeled random finite sets multi-object filters, prior work has been established to construct a labeled multi-object birth density using measurements from multiple sensors. A naive construction of this adaptive birth set density results in an exponential number of newborn components in the number of sensors. A truncation procedure was provided that leverages a Gibbs sampler to truncate the birth density, reducing the complexity to quadratic in the number of sensors. However, only a limited discussion has been provided on additional algorithmic techniques that can be employed to substantially reduce the complexity in practical tracking applications. In this paper, we propose five efficiency enhancements for the labeled random finite sets multi-sensor adaptive birth procedure. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate their computational benefits and show that they result in a negligible change to the multi-target tracking performance.</p>

            <p>The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers, effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in 4D generation have demonstrated its remarkable capability in synthesizing photorealistic renderings of dynamic 3D scenes. However, despite achieving impressive visual performance, almost all existing methods overlook the generation of spatial audio aligned with the corresponding 4D scenes, posing a significant limitation to truly immersive audiovisual experiences. To mitigate this issue, we propose Sonic4D, a novel framework that enables spatial audio generation for immersive exploration of 4D scenes. Specifically, our method is composed of three stages: 1) To capture both the dynamic visual content and raw auditory information from a monocular video, we first employ pre-trained expert models to generate the 4D scene and its corresponding monaural audio. 2) Subsequently, to transform the monaural audio into spatial audio, we localize and track the sound sources within the 4D scene, where their 3D spatial coordinates at different timestamps are estimated via a pixel-level visual grounding strategy. 3) Based on the estimated sound source locations, we further synthesize plausible spatial audio that varies across different viewpoints and timestamps using physics-based simulation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method generates realistic spatial audio consistent with the synthesized 4D scene in a training-free manner, significantly enhancing the immersive experience for users.

            <p>Modern two and four legged robots exhibit impressive mobility on complex terrain, largely attributed to advancement in learning algorithms. However, these systems often rely on high-bandwidth sensing and onboard computation to perceive/respond to terrain uncertainties. Further, current locomotion strategies typically require extensive robot-specific training, limiting their generalizability across platforms. Building on our prior research connecting robot-environment interaction and communication theory, we develop a new paradigm to construct robust and simply controlled multi-legged elongate robots (MERs) capable of operating effectively in cluttered, unstructured environments. In this framework, each leg-ground contact is thought of as a basic active contact (bac), akin to bits in signal transmission. Reliable locomotion can be achieved in open-loop on "noisy" landscapes via sufficient redundancy in bacs. In such situations, robustness is achieved through passive mechanical responses. We term such processes as those displaying mechanical intelligence (MI) and analogize these processes to forward error correction (FEC) in signal transmission. To augment MI, we develop feedback control schemes, which we refer to as computational intelligence (CI) and such processes analogize automatic repeat request (ARQ) in signal transmission. Integration of these analogies between locomotion and communication theory allow analysis, design, and prediction of embodied intelligence control schemes (integrating MI and CI) in MERs, showing effective and reliable performance (approximately half body lengths per cycle) on complex landscapes with terrain "noise" over twice the robot's height. Our work provides a foundation for systematic development of MER control, paving the way for terrain-agnostic, agile, and resilient robotic systems capable of operating in extreme environments.</p>

            <p>Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been identified as a new disruptive technology for future wireless systems to support a large number of users with only a few antennas. However, the intricate relationships between the signal carrier wavelength and the transceiver region size lead to inaccuracies in traditional far-field 6DMA channel model, causing discrepancies between the model predictions and the hybrid-field channel characteristics in practical 6DMA systems, where users might be in the far-field region relative to the antennas on the same 6DMA surface, while simultaneously being in the near-field region relative to different 6DMA surfaces. Moreover, due to the high-dimensional channel and the coupled position and rotation constraints, the estimation of the 6DMA channel and the joint design of the 6DMA positions and rotations and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) incur extremely high computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid-field generalized 6DMA channel model, which accounts for planar-wave propagation within individual 6DMA surfaces and spherical-wave propagation among different 6DMA surfaces. Furthermore, by leveraging directional sparsity, we propose a low-overhead channel estimation algorithm that efficiently constructs a complete channel map for all potential antenna position-rotation pairs while limiting the training overhead incurred by antenna movement. In addition, we propose a low-complexity design leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which facilitates the joint design of the 6DMA positions, rotations, and beamforming in a unified manner. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid-field channel model and channel estimation algorithm outperform existing approaches and that the DRL-enhanced 6DMA system significantly surpasses flexible antenna systems.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal. In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization. Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method, highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.</p>

            <h2>Pieceformer: Similarity-Driven Knowledge Transfer via Scalable Graph Transformer in VLSI</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Yang, Yusheng Hu, Yong Liu, Cong (Callie)Hao</p>
            <p>Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design, enabling the reuse of prior solutions to reduce engineering effort and turnaround time. We propose Pieceformer, a scalable, self-supervised similarity assessment framework, equipped with a hybrid message-passing and graph transformer encoder. To address transformer scalability, we incorporate a linear transformer backbone and introduce a partitioned training pipeline for efficient memory and parallelism management. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world CircuitNet datasets show that Pieceformer reduces mean absolute error (MAE) by 24.9% over the baseline and is the only method to correctly cluster all real-world design groups. We further demonstrate the practical usage of our model through a case study on a partitioning task, achieving up to 89% runtime reduction. These results validate the framework's effectiveness for scalable, unbiased design reuse in modern VLSI systems.</p>

            <h2>Early Attentive Sparsification Accelerates Neural Speech Transcription</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zifei Xu, Sayeh Sharify, Hesham Mostafa, Tristan Webb, Wanzin Yazar, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible, here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders. With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under 1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.</p>

            <h2>MoiréXNet: Adaptive Multi-Scale Demoiréing with Linear Attention Test-Time Training and Truncated Flow Matching Prior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liangyan Li, Yimo Ning, Kevin Le, Wei Dong, Yunzhe Li, Jun Chen, Xiaohong Liu</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoiréing by integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning techniques. Demoiréing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes, which pose significant challenges for existing methods. Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moiré patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoiréing and often introduce artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT) modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoiréing. The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration performance.</p>

            <h2>HybridRAG-based LLM Agents for Low-Carbon Optimization in Low-Altitude Economy Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinbo Wen, Cheng Su, Jiawen Kang, Jiangtian Nie, Yang Zhang, Jianhang Tang, Dusit Niyato, Chau Yuen</p>
            <p>Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) are emerging as a promising paradigm to support various low-altitude services through integrated air-ground infrastructure. To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Connor Ding, Abhiram Rao Gorle, Jiwon Jeong, Naomi Sagan, Tsachy Weissman</p>
            <p>In this work, we explore the interplay between information and computation in non-linear transform-based compression for broad classes of modern information-processing tasks. We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact, resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) "transform", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints and performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Frohmann, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, Markus Schedl, Elena V. Epure</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders, and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability. Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world scenarios. Our code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>The rapid advancement of the metaverse, digital twins, and robotics underscores the demand for low-cost, portable mapping systems for reality capture. Current mobile solutions, such as the Leica BLK2Go and lidar-equipped smartphones, either come at a high cost or are limited in range and accuracy. Leveraging the proliferation and technological evolution of mobile devices alongside recent advancements in lidar technology, we introduce a novel, low-cost, portable mobile mapping system. Our system integrates a lidar unit, an Android smartphone, and an RTK-GNSS stick. Running on the Android platform, it features lidar-inertial odometry built with the NDK, and logs data from the lidar, wide-angle camera, IMU, and GNSS. With a total bill of materials (BOM) cost under 2,000 USD and a weight of about 1 kilogram, the system achieves a good balance between affordability and portability. We detail the system design, multisensor calibration, synchronization, and evaluate its performance for tracking and mapping.

            <h2>Dual-Objective Reinforcement Learning with Novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Formulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Sharpless, Dylan Hirsch, Sander Tonkens, Nikhil Shinde, Sylvia Herbert</p>
            <p>Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance. Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.</p>

            <p>To explore the potential advantages of utilizing spatial cues from images for generating stereo singing voices with room reverberation, we introduce VS-Singer, a vision-guided model designed to produce stereo singing voices with room reverberation from scene images. VS-Singer comprises three modules: firstly, a modal interaction network integrates spatial features into text encoding to create a linguistic representation enriched with spatial information. Secondly, the decoder employs a consistency Schrödinger bridge to facilitate one-step sample generation. Moreover, we utilize the SFE module to improve the consistency of audio-visual matching. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine stereo singing voice synthesis with visual acoustic matching within a unified framework. Experimental results demonstrate that VS-Singer can effectively generate stereo singing voices that align with the scene perspective in a single step.</p>

            <h2>A Scalable Factorization Approach for High-Order Structured Tensor Recovery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Qin, Michael B. Wakin, Zhihui Zhu</p>
            <p>Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold. Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably, both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker and tensor-train format tensors.</p>

            <h2>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiko Ueda, Shoma Yagi, Genki Ichinose</p>
            <p>An oligopoly is a market in which the price of a goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shrinivas Chimmalgi, Laurent Schmalen, Vahid Aref</p>
            <p>Probabilistic constellation shaping enables easy rate adaption and has been proven to reduce the gap to Shannon capacity. Constellation point probabilities are optimized to maximize either the mutual information or the bit-wise mutual information. The optimization problem is however challenging even for simple channel models. While autoencoder-based machine learning has been applied successfully to solve this problem [1], it requires manual computation of additional terms for the gradient which is an error-prone task. In this work, we present novel loss functions for autoencoder-based learning of probabilistic constellation shaping for coded modulation systems using automatic differentiation and importance sampling. We show analytically that our proposed approach also uses exact gradients of the constellation point probabilities for the optimization. In simulations, our results closely match the results from [1] for the additive white Gaussian noise channel and a simplified model of the intensity-modulation direct-detection channel.</p>

            <p>Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation. Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based approaches.</p>

            <p>Accurately estimating sound source positions is crucial for robot audition. However, existing sound source localization methods typically rely on a microphone array with at least two spatially preconfigured microphones. This requirement hinders the applicability of microphone-based robot audition systems and technologies. To alleviate these challenges, we propose an online sound source localization method that uses a single microphone mounted on a mobile robot in reverberant environments. Specifically, we develop a lightweight neural network model with only 43k parameters to perform real-time distance estimation by extracting temporal information from reverberant signals. The estimated distances are then processed using an extended Kalman filter to achieve online sound source localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve online sound source localization using a single microphone on a moving robot, a gap that we aim to fill in this work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach. To benefit the broader research community, we have open-sourced our code at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Aerospace engines, as critical components in aviation and aerospace industries, require continuous and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure operational safety and prevent catastrophic failures. While deep learning techniques have been extensively studied in this context, they output logits or confidence scores, necessitating post-processing to derive actionable insights. Furthermore, the potential of large-scale audio models in this domain remains largely untapped. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AeroGPT, a novel framework that transfers knowledge from general audio domain to aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis. AeroGPT is a framework based on large-scale audio model that incorporates Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to adapt general audio knowledge to domain-specific vibration patterns, and combines Generative Fault Classification (GFC) to directly output interpretable fault labels. This approach eliminates the need for post-processing of fault labels, supports interactive, interpretable, and actionable fault diagnosis, thereby greatly enhancing industrial applicability. Through comprehensive experimental validation on two aero-engine bearing datasets, AeroGPT achieved exceptional performance with 98.94% accuracy on the DIRG dataset and perfect 100% classification on the HIT bearing dataset, surpassing traditional deep learning approaches. Additional Qualitative analysis validates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights the potential of large-scale models to revolutionize fault diagnosis.</p>

            <p>The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems, particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi, Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as SONAR and SeamlessM4T.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyi Wang, Jemil Avers Butt, Shengyu Huang, Tomislav Medic, Andreas Wieser</p>
            <p>Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features. These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks.

            <p>Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted relevance module integrates question and the associated image content, exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking assessment.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising approaches.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents (especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste, let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement, with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.</p>

            <p>In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features, substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models. Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play, including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total) paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.</p>

            <h2>State-Space Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Interpretable Nonlinear System Identification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonçalo Granjal Cruz, Balazs Renczes, Mark C Runacres, Jan Decuyper</p>
            <p>While accurate, black-box system identification models lack interpretability of the underlying system dynamics. This paper proposes State-Space Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (SS-KAN) to address this challenge by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within a state-space framework. The proposed model is validated on two benchmark systems: the Silverbox and the Wiener-Hammerstein benchmarks. Results show that SS-KAN provides enhanced interpretability due to sparsity-promoting regularization and the direct visualization of its learned univariate functions, which reveal system nonlinearities at the cost of accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art black-box models, highlighting SS-KAN as a promising approach for interpretable nonlinear system identification, balancing accuracy and interpretability of nonlinear system dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Berk Yilmaz, Daniel Fidel Harvey, Prajit Dhuri</p>
            <p>This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations -- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image classification. The primary objective is to assess the trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and classification accuracy during training and inference. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74% accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late layers achieved 79% accuracy, with an average energy consumption of only 39 kJ per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient and effective approach for energy-constrained CNN applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Hachem, Clément Roos, Thierry Miquel, Murat Bronz</p>
            <p>This paper presents a robust cascaded control architecture for over-actuated multirotors. It extends the Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) control combined with structured H_inf control, initially proposed for under-actuated multirotors, to a broader range of multirotor configurations. To achieve precise and robust attitude and position tracking, we employ a weighted least-squares geometric guidance control allocation method, formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, enabling full-pose tracking. The proposed approach effectively addresses key challenges, such as preventing infeasible pose references and enhancing robustness against disturbances, as well as considering multirotor's actual physical limitations. Numerical simulations with an over-actuated hexacopter validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse mission scenarios and its potential for real-world aerial applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vlad Cnejevici, Matthias Ponfick, Raul C. Sîmpetru, Alessandro Del Vecchio</p>
            <p>Restoring movement of a paralyzed foot is a key challenge in helping individuals with neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury (SCI) to improve their quality of life. Neuroprostheses based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) can restore the physiological range of motion by stimulating the affected muscles using surface electrodes. We have previously shown that, despite chronic motor-complete SCI, it is possible to capture paralyzed hand movements in individuals with tetraplegia using spared and modulated motor unit (MU) activity decoded with non-invasive electromyography (EMG) sensors. This study investigated whether a wearable high-density surface EMG system could capture and control paralyzed foot kinematics in closed-loop control with an FES system. We found that all our participants with SCI (2 with chronic SCI and 3 with acute SCI) retained distinct spared EMG activity for at least three ankle movements, which allowed them to reliably control a digital cursor using their spared tibialis anterior and triceps surae MU activity. Movement separability was further reconfirmed by extracting task-modulated MU activity during foot flexion/extension (3-7 modulated MUs/participant). Three participants were further able to modulate and maintain their foot flexion/extension EMG levels with an accuracy of >70%. Lastly, we show that real-time control of a FES system using EMG from the affected limb can restore foot movements in a highly intuitive way, significantly improving the lost or pathological foot range of motion. Our system provides an intuitive approach for closed-loop control of FES that has the potential to assist individuals with SCI in regaining lost motor functions.</p>

            <h2>Manifold Learning for Personalized and Label-Free Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmias</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Reza Vazifeh, Jason W. Fleischer</p>
            <p>Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail. Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96% and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond cardiology.</p>

            <p>As autonomous vehicles edge closer to widespread adoption, enhancing road safety through collision avoidance and minimization of collateral damage becomes imperative. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, which include vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-cloud (V2C), are being proposed as mechanisms to achieve this safety improvement. Simulation-based testing is crucial for early-stage evaluation of Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) control systems, offering a safer and more cost-effective alternative to real-world tests. However, simulating large 3D environments with many complex single- and multi-vehicle sensors and controllers is computationally intensive. There is currently no evaluation framework that can effectively evaluate realistic scenarios involving large numbers of autonomous vehicles. We propose eCAV -- an efficient, modular, and scalable evaluation platform to facilitate both functional validation of algorithmic approaches to increasing road safety, as well as performance prediction of algorithms of various V2X technologies, including a futuristic Vehicle-to-Edge control plane and correspondingly designed control algorithms. eCAV can model up to 256 vehicles running individual control algorithms without perception enabled, which is $8\times$ more vehicles than what is possible with state-of-the-art alternatives. %faster than state-of-the-art alternatives that can simulate $8\times$ fewer vehicles. With perception enabled, eCAV simulates up to 64 vehicles with a step time under 800ms, which is $4\times$ more and $1.5\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art OpenCDA framework.</p>

            <p>Fully re-orientable small spacecraft are now supported by commercial technologies, allowing them to point their instruments in any direction and capture images, with short notice. When combined with improved onboard processing, and implemented on a constellation of inter-communicable satellites, this intelligent agility can significantly increase responsiveness to transient or evolving phenomena. We demonstrate a ground-based and onboard algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control, inter-satellite communication, intelligent prediction and planning to schedule the time-varying, re-orientation of agile, small satellites in a constellation. Planner intelligence is improved by updating the predictive value of future space-time observations based on shared observations of evolving episodic precipitation and urban flood forecasts. Reliable inter-satellite communication within a fast, dynamic constellation topology is modeled in the physical, access control and network layer. We apply the framework on a representative 24-satellite constellation observing 5 global regions. Results show appropriately low latency in information exchange (average within 1/3rd available time for implicit consensus), enabling the onboard scheduler to observe ~7% more flood magnitude than a ground-based implementation. Both onboard and offline versions performed ~98% better than constellations without agility.</p>

            <h2>Towards Bitrate-Efficient and Noise-Robust Speech Coding with Variable Bitrate RVQ</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunkee Chae, Kyogu Lee</p>
            <p>Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) has become a dominant approach in neural speech and audio coding, providing high-fidelity compression. However, speech coding presents additional challenges due to real-world noise, which degrades compression efficiency. Standard codecs allocate bits uniformly, wasting bitrate on noise components that do not contribute to intelligibility. This paper introduces a Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) framework for noise-robust speech coding, dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs. Unlike constant bitrate (CBR) RVQ, our method prioritizes critical speech components while suppressing residual noise. Additionally, we integrate a feature denoiser to further improve noise robustness. Experimental results show that VRVQ improves rate-distortion trade-offs over conventional methods, achieving better compression efficiency and perceptual quality in noisy conditions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyang Yu, Tianyi Wang, Junfeng Jiao, Fengwu Shan, Hongqing Chu, Bingzhao Gao</p>
            <p>In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs, but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety, efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.</p>

            <h2>An Optimization-Augmented Control Framework for Single and Coordinated Multi-Arm Robotic Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melih Özcan, Ozgur S. Oguz</p>
            <p>Robotic manipulation demands precise control over both contact forces and motion trajectories. While force control is essential for achieving compliant interaction and high-frequency adaptation, it is limited to operations in close proximity to the manipulated object and often fails to maintain stable orientation during extended motion sequences. Conversely, optimization-based motion planning excels in generating collision-free trajectories over the robot's configuration space but struggles with dynamic interactions where contact forces play a crucial role. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-modal control framework that combines force control and optimization-augmented motion planning to tackle complex robotic manipulation tasks in a sequential manner, enabling seamless switching between control modes based on task requirements. Our approach decomposes complex tasks into subtasks, each dynamically assigned to one of three control modes: Pure optimization for global motion planning, pure force control for precise interaction, or hybrid control for tasks requiring simultaneous trajectory tracking and force regulation. This framework is particularly advantageous for bimanual and multi-arm manipulation, where synchronous motion and coordination among arms are essential while considering both the manipulated object and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through a range of long-horizon manipulation tasks, including single-arm, bimanual, and multi-arm applications, highlighting its ability to handle both free-space motion and contact-rich manipulation with robustness and precision.</p>

            <p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.</p>

            <h2>Online Feedback Optimization for Monotone Systems without Timescale Separation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mattia Bianchi, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) steers a dynamical plant to a cost-efficient steady-state, only relying on input-output sensitivity information, rather than on a full plant model. Unlike traditional feedforward approaches, OFO leverages real-time measurements from the plant, thereby inheriting the robustness and adaptability of feedback control. Unfortunately, existing theoretical guarantees for OFO assumes that the controller operates on a slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and transient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale separation'' assumption. Specifically, we consider the class of monotone systems, and we prove that OFO can achieve an optimal operating point, regardless of the time constants of controller and plant. By leveraging a small gain theorem for monotone systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for global convergence. Notably, these conditions depend only on the steady-state behavior of the plant, and they are entirely independent of the transient dynamics.</p>

            <p>Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free, multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.</p>

            <p>Off-road autonomous navigation is a challenging task as it is mainly dependent on the accuracy of the motion model. Motion model performances are limited by their ability to predict the interaction between the terrain and the UGV, which an onboard sensor can not directly measure. In this work, we propose using the DRIVE protocol to standardize the collection of data for system identification and characterization of the slip state space. We validated this protocol by acquiring a dataset with two platforms (from 75 kg to 470 kg) on six terrains (i.e., asphalt, grass, gravel, ice, mud, sand) for a total of 4.9 hours and 14.7 km. Using this data, we evaluate the DRIVE protocol's ability to explore the velocity command space and identify the reachable velocities for terrain-robot interactions. We investigated the transfer function between the command velocity space and the resulting steady-state slip for an SSMR. An unpredictability metric is proposed to estimate command uncertainty and help assess risk likelihood and severity in deployment. Finally, we share our lessons learned on running system identification on large UGV to help the community.</p>

            <p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models. Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD, KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD, 0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721 to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunshan Li, Wenwu Gong, Qianqian Wang, Chao Wang, Lili Yang</p>
            <p>Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however, existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode, neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep) model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction (i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

            <p>With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization, and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz. Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform baselines on text-to-speech tasks.</p>

            <p>Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2 (sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force). Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7% on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways, quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers, highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides mechanistic insights of human muscle activities.

Current research efforts focus primarily on text description augmentation and architectural innovations, yet the potential of integrating pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) audio models and Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) frameworks, capable of extracting cross-modal audio-text relationships, remains underexplored. To address this, we present HybridSep, a two-stage LASS framework that synergizes SSL-based acoustic representations with CLAP-derived semantic embeddings. Our framework introduces Adversarial Consistent Training (ACT), a novel optimization strategy that treats diffusion as an auxiliary regularization loss while integrating adversarial training to enhance separation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that HybridSep achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., AudioSep, FlowSep) across multiple metrics, establishing new benchmarks for LASS tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junghyun Koo, Marco A. Martinez-Ramirez, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Giorgio Fabbro, Michele Mancusi, Yuki Mitsufuji</p>
            <p>Music mastering style transfer aims to model and apply the mastering characteristics of a reference track to a target track, simulating the professional mastering process. However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.</p>

            <h2>Reversing Flow for Image Restoration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haina Qin, Wenyang Luo, Libin Wang, Dandan Zheng, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang, Bing Li, Weiming Hu</p>
            <p>Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p>

            <h2>Unsupervised Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Real-World Degradation Patterns</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyang Tie, Hong Zhu, Yunyun Luo, Jing Shi</p>
            <p>The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charilaos Papaioannou, Emmanouil Benetos, Alexandros Potamianos</p>
            <p>Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for future progress.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ezzat Elokda, Andrea Censi, Emilio Frazzoli, Florian Dörfler, Saverio Bolognani</p>
            <p>Control systems will play a pivotal role in addressing societal-scale challenges as they drive the development of sustainable future smart cities. At the heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy, transportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that monetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity -- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this vision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary mechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of many socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and efficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting resource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we review related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a case for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and static to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as the formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts. We show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize long-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart city built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different socio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single karma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new flexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx, David Vargas</p>
            <p>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique. We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA, namely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA which splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding, CS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into common and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and private streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance analysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in mismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can better capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under finite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to maximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed. The numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than conventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a physical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through link-level simulations. Aside performance benefits, we also demonstrate that CS-RSMA brings significant benefits on the encoding/decoding, control signaling, and retransmission process compared to conventional RSMA.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in parallel simulation and successful robotic applications are spurring a resurgence in sampling-based model predictive control. To build on this progress, however, the robotics community needs common tooling for prototyping, evaluating, and deploying sampling-based controllers.

To facilitate rapid prototyping and evaluation, Judo provides robust implementations of common sampling-based MPC algorithms and standardized benchmark tasks. It further emphasizes usability with simple but extensible interfaces for controller and task definitions, asynchronous execution for straightforward simulation-to-hardware transfer, and a highly customizable interactive GUI for tuning controllers interactively. While written in Python, the software leverages MuJoCo as its physics backend to achieve real-time performance, which we validate across both consumer and server-grade hardware.

            <h2>Worst-Case Services and State-Based Scheduling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yike Xu, Mark S. Andersland</p>
            <p>In this paper, we shed new light on a classical scheduling problem: given a slot-timed, constant-capacity server, what short-run scheduling decisions must be made to provide long-run service guarantees to competing flows of unit-sized tasks? We model each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that maps each queued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals, including those initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector lower-bounding its cumulative served tasks. We show that these maps are states that can be updated as tasks arrive and are served, introduce state-based scheduling, find the schedulability condition necessary and sufficient to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and use this condition to identify all short-run scheduling decisions that preserve schedulability. Our framework is general but computationally complex. To reduce complexity, we consider three specializations. First, we show that when satisfactory short-run scheduling decisions exist, at least one can be efficiently identified by maximizing the server's capacity slack, a generalization of the earliest-deadline-first rule. Second, we show that a special class of worst-case services, min-plus services, can be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus algebra. Finally, we show that efficiency can be further improved by restricting attention to a min-plus service subclass, dual-curve services. This last specialization turns out to be a dynamic extension of service curves that maintains all essential features of our framework while approaching near practical viability.</p>

            <h2>Model Reduction of a Flexible Nonsmooth Oscillator Recovers its Entire Bifurcation Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suparno Bhattacharyya, Joseph. P. Cusumano</p>
            <p>We study the reduced order modeling of a piecewise-linear, globally nonlinear flexible oscillator in which a Bernoulli-Euler beam is subjected to a position-triggered kick force and a piecewise restoring force at its tip. The nonsmooth boundary conditions, which determine different regions of a hybrid phase space, can generally be expected to excite many degrees of freedom. With kick strength as parameter, the system's bifurcation diagram is found to exhibit a range of periodic and chaotic behaviors. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to obtain a single set of global basis functions spanning all of the hybrid regions. The reduced order model (ROM) dimension is chosen using previously developed energy closure analysis, ensuring approximate energy balance on the reduced subspace. This yields accurate ROMs with 8 degrees of freedom. Remarkably, we find that ROMs formulated using using data from individual periodic steady states can nevertheless be used to reconstruct the entire bifurcation structure of the original system without updating. This demonstrates that, despite being constructed with steady state data, the ROMs model sufficiently small transients with enough accuracy to permit using simple continuation for the bifurcation diagram. We also find ROM subspaces obtained for different values of the bifurcation parameter are essentially identical. Thus, POD augmented with energy closure analysis is found to reliably yield effective dimension estimates and ROMs for this nonlinear, nonsmooth system that are robust across stability transitions, including even period doubling cascades to chaos, thereby greatly reducing data requirements and computational costs.</p>

            <p>Safely exploring environments with a-priori unknown constraints is a fundamental challenge that restricts the autonomy of robots. While safety is paramount, guarantees on sufficient exploration are also crucial for ensuring autonomous task completion. To address these challenges, we propose a novel safe guaranteed exploration framework using optimal control, which achieves first-of-its-kind results: guaranteed exploration for non-linear systems with finite time sample complexity bounds, while being provably safe with arbitrarily high probability. The framework is general and applicable to many real-world scenarios with complex non-linear dynamics and unknown domains. We improve the efficiency of this general framework by proposing an algorithm, SageMPC, SAfe Guaranteed Exploration using Model Predictive Control. SageMPC leverages three key techniques: i) exploiting a Lipschitz bound, ii) goal-directed exploration, and iii) receding horizon style re-planning, all while maintaining the desired sample complexity, safety and exploration guarantees of the framework. Lastly, we demonstrate safe efficient exploration in challenging unknown environments using SageMPC with a car model.</p>

            <h2>Driving Towards Stability and Efficiency: A Variable Time Gap Strategy for Adaptive Cruise Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaimaa K. El-Baklish, Anastasios Kouvelas, Michail A. Makridis</p>
            <p>Automated vehicle technologies offer a promising avenue for enhancing traffic efficiency, safety, and energy consumption. Among these, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems stand out as a prevalent form of automation on today's roads, with their time gap settings holding paramount importance. While decreasing the average time headway tends to enhance traffic capacity, it simultaneously raises concerns regarding safety and string stability. This study introduces a novel variable time gap feedback control policy aimed at striking a balance between maintaining a minimum time gap setting under equilibrium car-following conditions, thereby improving traffic capacity, while ensuring string stability to mitigate disturbances away from the equilibrium flow. Leveraging nonlinear $H_\infty$ control technique, the strategy employs a variable time gap component as the manipulated control signal, complemented by a constant time gap component that predominates during car-following equilibrium. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is evaluated against its constant time-gap counterpart calibrated using field platoon data from the OpenACC dataset. Through numerical and traffic simulations, our findings illustrate that the proposed algorithm effectively dampens perturbations within vehicle platoons, leading to a more efficient and safer mixed traffic flow.</p>

            <p>3D medical image segmentation is a challenging task with crucial implications for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced fully supervised medical image segmentation. However, this approach heavily relies on labor-intensive and time-consuming fully annotated ground-truth labels, particularly for 3D volumes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel probabilistic-aware weakly supervised learning pipeline, specifically designed for 3D medical imaging. Our pipeline integrates three innovative components: a Probability-based Pseudo Label Generation technique for synthesizing dense segmentation masks from sparse annotations, a Probabilistic Multi-head Self-Attention network for robust feature extraction within our Probabilistic Transformer Network, and a Probability-informed Segmentation Loss Function to enhance training with annotation confidence. Demonstrating significant advances, our approach not only rivals the performance of fully supervised methods but also surpasses existing weakly supervised methods in CT and MRI datasets, achieving up to 18.1% improvement in Dice scores for certain organs.

            <h2>Conservative Linear Envelopes for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional, Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Will Sharpless, Yat Tin Chow, Sylvia Herbert</p>
            <p>Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) provides a value function that encodes the set of states from which a system with bounded control inputs can reach or avoid a target despite any bounded disturbance, and the corresponding robust, optimal control policy. Though powerful, traditional methods for HJR rely on dynamic programming (DP) and suffer from exponential computation growth with respect to state dimension. The recently favored Hopf formula mitigates this ``curse of dimensionality'' by providing an efficient and space-parallelizable approach for solving the reachability problem. However, the Hopf formula can only be applied to linear time-varying systems. To overcome this limitation, we show that the error between a nonlinear system and a linear model can be transformed into an adversarial bounded artificial disturbance. One may then solve the dimension-robust generalized Hopf formula for a linear game with this ``antagonistic error" to perform guaranteed conservative reachability analysis and control synthesis of nonlinear systems; this can be done for problem formulations in which no other HJR method is both computationally feasible and guaranteed. In addition, we offer several technical methods for reducing conservativeness in the analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our results through one illustrative example (the controlled Van der Pol system) that can be compared to standard DP, and one higher-dimensional 15D example (a 5-agent pursuit-evasion game with Dubins cars).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Will Sharpless, Yat Tin Chow, Sylvia Herbert</p>
            <p>Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) is a popular method for analyzing the liveness and safety of a dynamical system with bounded control and disturbance. The corresponding HJ value function offers a robust controller and characterizes the reachable sets, but is traditionally solved with Dynamic Programming (DP) and limited to systems of dimension less than six. Recently, the space-parallelizeable, generalized Hopf formula has been shown to also solve the HJ value with a nearly three-log increase in dimension limit, but is limited to linear systems. To extend this potential, we demonstrate how state-augmented (SA) spaces, which are well-known for their improved linearization accuracy, may be used to solve tighter, conservative approximations of the value function with any linear model in this SA space. Namely, we show that with a representation of the true dynamics in the SA space, a series of inequalities confirms that the value of a SA linear game with antagonistic error is a conservative envelope of the true value function. It follows that if the optimal controller for the HJ SA linear game with error may succeed, it will also succeed in the true system. Unlike previous methods, this result offers the ability to safely approximate reachable sets and their corresponding controllers with the Hopf formula in a non-convex manner. Finally, we demonstrate this in the slow manifold system for clarity, and in the controlled Van der Pol system with different lifting functions.</p>

            <p>Traditional cameras face a trade-off between low-light performance and high-speed imaging: longer exposure times to capture sufficient light results in motion blur, whereas shorter exposures result in Poisson-corrupted noisy images. While burst photography techniques help mitigate this tradeoff, conventional cameras are fundamentally limited in their sensor noise characteristics. Event cameras and single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional cameras due to their desirable properties. SPADs are capable of single-photon sensitivity with microsecond temporal resolution, and event cameras can measure brightness changes up to 1 MHz with low bandwidth requirements. We show that these properties are complementary, and can help achieve low-light, high-speed image reconstruction with low bandwidth requirements. We introduce a sensor fusion framework to combine SPADs with event cameras to improves the reconstruction of high-speed, low-light scenes while reducing the high bandwidth cost associated with using every SPAD frame. Our evaluation, on both synthetic and real sensor data, demonstrates significant enhancements ( > 5 dB PSNR) in reconstructing low-light scenes at high temporal resolution (100 kHz) compared to conventional cameras. Event-SPAD fusion shows great promise for real-world applications, such as robotics or medical imaging.</p>

Although traditional machine learning algorithms have been valuable, they exhibit limitations in handling complex sample data. The recent emergence of deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, driving substantial advancements in this field. This review focuses on recent progress in deep learning for pulmonary nodule detection, segmentation, and classification. Traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, have shown limitations, paving the way for advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinze Lyu, Sundar Aditya, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>A canonical use case of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involves a multi-antenna transmitter communicating with $K$ users and sensing targets in its vicinity. For this setup, precoder and multiple access designs are of utmost importance, as the limited transmit power budget must be efficiently directed towards the desired directions (users and targets) to maximize both communications and sensing performance. This problem has been widely investigated analytically under various design choices, in particular (a) whether or not a dedicated sensing signal is needed, and (b) for different MIMO multiple access techniques, such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA). However, a conclusive answer on which design choice achieves the best ISAC performance, backed by experimental results, remains elusive. We address this vacuum by experimentally evaluating and comparing RSMA and SDMA for communicating with two users $(K = 2)$ and sensing (ranging) one target. Over three scenarios that are representative of \emph{vehicular} ISAC, covering different levels of inter-user interference and separation/integration between sensing and communications, we show that RSMA without a dedicated sensing signal achieves better ISAC performance -- i.e., higher sum throughput (up to $50\%$ peak throughput gain) for similar radar SNR (between $20$ to $24{\rm dB}$) -- than SDMA with a dedicated sensing signal. This first-ever experimental study of RSMA ISAC demonstrates the feasibility and the superiority of RSMA for future multi-functional wireless systems.</p>

            <h2>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tierui Gong, Chau Yuen, Chong Meng Samson See, Mérouane Debbah, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided wireless receiver for multi-target DOA detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Our model reveals that the presence of the radio-frequency local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA creates sensor gain mismatches, which degrade the DOA estimation significantly by employing the classical Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). To solve this sensor gain mismatch problem, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum ESPRIT (RAQ-ESPRIT) relying on our model. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations, where the results exhibit that it is capable of reducing the estimation error of its classical counterpart on the order of $> 400$-fold and $> 9000$-fold in the PSL and SQL, respectively.</p>

            <h2>DualGuard MPPI: Safe and Performant Optimal Control by Combining Sampling-Based MPC and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Borquez, Luke Raus, Yusuf Umut Ciftci, Somil Bansal</p>
            <p>Designing controllers that are both safe and performant is inherently challenging. This co-optimization can be formulated as a constrained optimal control problem, where the cost function represents the performance criterion and safety is specified as a constraint. While sampling-based methods, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have shown great promise in tackling complex optimal control problems, they often struggle to enforce safety constraints. To address this limitation, we propose DualGuard-MPPI, a novel framework for solving safety-constrained optimal control problems. Our approach integrates Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis within the MPPI sampling process to ensure that all generated samples are provably safe for the system. On the one hand, this integration allows DualGuard-MPPI to enforce strict safety constraints; at the same time, it facilitates a more effective exploration of the environment with the same number of samples, reducing the effective sampling variance and leading to better performance optimization. Through several simulations and hardware experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves much higher performance compared to existing MPPI methods, without compromising safety.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zefan Yang, Xuanang Xu, Jiajin Zhang, Ge Wang, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Pingkun Yan</p>
            <p>Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most frequently ordered imaging test, supporting diverse clinical tasks from thoracic disease detection to postoperative monitoring. However, task-specific classification models are limited in scope, require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a self-supervised vision foundation model that learns robust CXR representations and generalizes effectively across a wide range of downstream tasks. We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40 disease findings across different prevalence levels on the CXR-LT 24 dataset and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular disease risk estimation and mortality prediction. These results highlight CheXFound's strong generalization capabilities, enabling diverse adaptations with improved label efficiency.

            <h2>Physics-Informed Recurrent Network for State-Space Modeling of Gas Pipeline Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siyuan Wang, Wenchuan Wu, Chenhui Lin, Qi Wang, Shuwei Xu, Binbin Chen</p>
            <p>As a part of the integrated energy system (IES), gas pipeline networks can provide additional flexibility to power systems through coordinated optimal dispatch. An accurate pipeline network model is critical for the optimal operation and control of IESs. However, inaccuracies or unavailability of accurate pipeline parameters often introduce errors in the state-space models of such networks. This paper proposes a physics-informed recurrent network (PIRN) to identify the state-space model of gas pipelines. It fuses sparse measurement data with fluid-dynamic behavior expressed by partial differential equations. By embedding the physical state-space model within the recurrent network, parameter identification becomes an end-to-end PIRN training task. The model can be realized in PyTorch through modifications to a standard RNN backbone. Case studies demonstrate that our proposed PIRN can accurately estimate gas pipeline models from sparse terminal node measurements, providing robust performance and significantly higher parameter efficiency. Furthermore, the identified state-space model of the pipeline network can be seamlessly integrated into optimization frameworks.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we introduce a multi-talker distant automatic speech recognition (DASR) system we designed for the DASR task 1 of the CHiME-8 challenge. Our system performs speaker counting, diarization, and ASR. It handles various recording conditions, from diner parties to professional meetings and from two to eight speakers. We perform diarization first, followed by speech enhancement, and then ASR as the challenge baseline. However, we introduced several key refinements. First, we derived a powerful speaker diarization relying on end-to-end speaker diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC), multi-channel speaker counting using enhanced embeddings from EEND-VC, and target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD). For speech enhancement, we introduced a novel microphone selection rule to better select the most relevant microphones among the distributed microphones and investigated improvements to beamforming. Finally, for ASR, we developed several models exploiting Whisper and WavLM speech foundation models. We present the results we submitted to the challenge and updated results we obtained afterward. Our strongest system achieves a 63% relative macro tcpWER improvement over the baseline and outperforms the challenge best results on the NOTSOFAR-1 meeting evaluation data among geometry-independent systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Strässer, Manuel Schaller, Julian Berberich, Karl Worthmann, Frank Allgöwer</p>
            <p>We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

            <p>We consider a patch-based learning approach defined in terms of neural networks to estimate spatially adaptive regularisation parameter maps for image denoising with weighted Total Variation (TV) and test it to situations when the noise distribution is unknown. As an example, we consider situations where noise could be either Gaussian or Poisson and perform preliminary model selection by a standard binary classification network. Then, we define a patch-based approach where at each image pixel an optimal weighting between TV regularisation and the corresponding data fidelity is learned in a supervised way using reference natural image patches upon optimisation of SSIM and in a sliding window fashion. Extensive numerical results are reported for both noise models, showing significant improvement w.r.t. results obtained by means of optimal scalar regularisation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Luo, Luping Xiang, Jie Hu, Kun Yang</p>
            <p>Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</p>

            <p>Advanced diagnostic instruments are crucial for the accurate detection and treatment of lung diseases, which affect millions of individuals globally. This study examines the effectiveness of deep learning and transfer learning models using a hybrid dataset, created by merging four individual datasets from Bangladesh and global sources. The hybrid dataset significantly enhances model accuracy and generalizability, particularly in detecting COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal lung conditions from chest X-ray images. A range of models, including CNN, VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50V2, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121, were applied to both individual and hybrid datasets. The results showed superior performance on the hybrid dataset, with VGG16, Xception, ResNet50V2, and DenseNet121 each achieving an accuracy of 99%. This consistent performance across the hybrid dataset highlights the robustness of these models in handling diverse data while maintaining high accuracy. To understand the models implicit behavior, explainable AI techniques were employed to illuminate their black-box nature. Specifically, LIME was used to enhance the interpretability of model predictions, especially in cases of misclassification, contributing to the development of reliable and interpretable AI-driven solutions for medical imaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Buyi Yu, Wenyuan Tang</p>
            <p>Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve the statistical characterization of peak demand. Due to the stationarity assumption of classical extreme value analysis (EVA), existing approaches in the industry apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monte-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monte-Carlo experiments become intractable, and state-of-the-art generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)-based nonstationary EVA is often impractical due to convergence issues on high-dimensional covariates. This article explores uncharted territories and proposes a novel nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. Compared to GAMLSS, our method automatically discovers and robustly models complex relationships between the covariate and the peak demand density. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a 38% reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</p>

            <p>Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility, the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial flexibility planning under uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Multilingual speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to directly convert spoken utterances from multiple source languages into fluent and intelligible speech in a target language. Despite recent progress, several critical challenges persist: 1) achieving high-quality S2ST remains a significant obstacle; 2) most existing S2ST methods rely heavily on large-scale parallel speech corpora, which are difficult and resource-intensive to obtain. To tackle these challenges, we introduce S2ST-Omni, a novel, efficient, and scalable framework tailored for multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Specifically, we decompose S2ST into speech-to-text translation (S2TT) and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). To enable high-quality S2TT while mitigating reliance on large-scale parallel speech corpora, we leverage powerful pretrained models: Whisper for robust audio understanding and Qwen 3.0 for advanced text comprehension. A lightweight speech adapter is introduced to bridge the modality gap between speech and text representations, facilitating effective utilization of pretrained multimodal knowledge. To ensure both translation accuracy and real-time responsiveness, we adopt a streaming speech generation model in the TTS stage, which generates the target speech in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments conducted on the CVSS benchmark demonstrate that S2ST-Omni consistently surpasses several state-of-the-art S2ST baselines in translation quality, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navid Hasanzadeh, Shahrokh Valaee</p>
            <p>The newly established IEEE 802.11bf Task Group aims to amend the WLAN standard to support advanced sensing applications such as human activity recognition (HAR). Although studies have demonstrated the potential of sub-7 GHz Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for HAR, no method currently performs reliably in real-world scenarios. This work tackles the poor generalization of Wi-Fi-based HAR by introducing an innovative approach to extracting and utilizing movement-related representations, which makes it robust to noise and static environmental properties. This is achieved by transforming CSI signals into the delay profile space and decomposing them into various Doppler velocities, which serve as informative projections of a mobile point's velocity from different unknown random angles. To mitigate the impact of this randomness, MORIC is introduced as a novel time series classification model based on random convolutional kernels, designed to be invariant to the random order and repetition of input representations, thereby enabling robust Wi-Fi CSI-based activity classification. Experimental results on the collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization accuracy for hand motion recognition, particularly for challenging gestures. Furthermore, incorporating a small number of calibration samples leads to a significant improvement in accuracy, enhancing the practicality of the method for real-world deployment.</p>

            <p>Existing large-scale zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models deliver high speech quality but suffer from slow inference speeds due to massive parameters. To address this issue, this paper introduces ZipVoice, a high-quality flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS model with a compact model size and fast inference speed. Key designs include: 1) a Zipformer-based flow-matching decoder to maintain adequate modeling capabilities under constrained size; 2) Average upsampling-based initial speech-text alignment and Zipformer-based text encoder to improve speech intelligibility; 3) A flow distillation method to reduce sampling steps and eliminate the inference overhead associated with classifier-free guidance. Experiments on 100k hours multilingual datasets show that ZipVoice matches state-of-the-art models in speech quality, while being 3 times smaller and up to 30 times faster than a DiT-based flow-matching baseline.

            <p>Satellite communications are crucial for the evolution beyond fifth-generation networks. However, the dynamic nature of satellite channels and their inherent impairments present significant challenges. In this paper, a novel post-compensation scheme that combines the complex-valued extreme learning machine with augmented hidden layer (CELMAH) architecture and widely linear processing (WLP) is developed to address these issues by exploiting signal impropriety in satellite communications. Although CELMAH shares structural similarities with WLP, it employs a different core algorithm and does not fully exploit the signal impropriety. By incorporating WLP principles, we derive a tailored formulation suited to the network structure and propose the CELM augmented by widely linear least squares (CELM-WLLS) for post-distortion. The proposed approach offers enhanced communication robustness and is highly effective for satellite communication scenarios characterized by dynamic channel conditions and non-linear impairments. CELM-WLLS is designed to improve signal recovery performance and outperform traditional methods such as least square (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE). Compared to CELMAH, CELM-WLLS demonstrates approximately 0.8 dB gain in BER performance, and also achieves a two-thirds reduction in computational complexity, making it a more efficient solution.</p>

            <h2>Local Differential Privacy for Distributed Stochastic Aggregative Optimization with Guaranteed Optimality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqin Chen, Yongqiang Wang</p>
            <p>Distributed aggregative optimization underpins many cooperative optimization and multi-agent control systems, where each agent's objective function depends both on its local optimization variable and an aggregate of all agents' optimization variables. Existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective functions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications. For example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two main sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the additional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to the issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which could breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that can solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization approaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square convergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to noise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the cumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of iterations tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm able to guarantee both accurate convergence and rigorous differential privacy in distributed aggregative optimization. Besides characterizing the convergence rates under nonconvex/convex/strongly convex conditions, we also rigorously quantify the cost of differential privacy in terms of convergence rates. Experimental results on personalized machine learning using benchmark datasets confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonghun Kim, Gyeongdeok Jo, Sinyoung Ra, Hyunjin Park</p>
            <p>Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images</p>

            <p>For neuromorphic engineering to emulate the human brain, improving memory density with low power consumption is an indispensable but challenging goal. In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes.

            <h2>Discrete nonlinear elastodynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp L. Kinon, Tobias Thoma, Peter Betsch, Paul Kotyczka</p>
            <p>We provide a fully nonlinear port-Hamiltonian formulation for discrete elastodynamical systems as well as a structure-preserving time discretization. The governing equations are obtained in a variational manner and represent index-1 differential algebraic equations. Performing an index reduction one obtains the port-Hamiltonian state space model, which features the nonlinear strains as an independent state next to position and velocity. Moreover, hyperelastic material behavior is captured in terms of a nonlinear stored energy function. The model exhibits passivity and losslessness and has an underlying symmetry yielding the conservation of angular momentum. We perform temporal discretization using the midpoint discrete gradient, such that the beneficial properties are inherited by the developed time stepping scheme in a discrete sense. The numerical results obtained in a representative example are demonstrated to validate the findings.</p>

            <h2>Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kailas Dayanandan, Nikhil Kumar, Anand Sinha, Brejesh Lall</p>
            <p>The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.</p>

            <h2>Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G-V2X HetNets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Shao, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Qiang Fan, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>This letter proposes a semantic-aware resource allocation (SARA) framework with flexible duty cycle (DC) coexistence mechanism (SARADC) for 5G-V2X Heterogeneous Network (HetNets) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proximal policy optimization (PPO). Specifically, we investigate V2X networks within a two-tiered HetNets structure. In response to the needs of high-speed vehicular networking in urban environments, we design a semantic communication system and introduce two resource allocation metrics: high-speed semantic transmission rate (HSR) and semantic spectrum efficiency (HSSE). Our main goal is to maximize HSSE. Additionally, we address the coexistence of vehicular users and WiFi users in 5G New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) networks. To tackle this complex challenge, we propose a novel approach that jointly optimizes flexible DC coexistence mechanism and the allocation of resources and base stations (BSs). Unlike traditional bit transmission methods, our approach integrates the semantic communication paradigm into the communication system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms traditional bit transmission methods with traditional DC coexistence mechanism in terms of HSSE and semantic throughput (ST) for both vehicular and WiFi users.</p>

            <h2>Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Based AoI-Aware Resource Allocation for RIS-Aided IoV Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Wen Chen, Jiangzhou Wang, Khaled B. Letaief</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a pivotal technology in communication, offering an alternative path that significantly enhances the link quality in wireless communication environments. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted internet of vehicles (IoV) network, considering the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication method. In addition, in order to improve the timeliness of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and the stability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we introduce the age of information (AoI) model and the payload transmission probability model. Therefore, with the objective of minimizing the AoI of V2I links and prioritizing transmission of V2V links payload, we construct this optimization problem as an Markov decision process (MDP) problem in which the BS serves as an agent to allocate resources and control phase-shift for the vehicles using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which gradually converges and maintains a high stability. A AoI-aware joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control scheme based on SAC algorithm is proposed and simulation results show that its convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance, and payload transmission probability outperforms those of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and stochastic algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kangwei Qi, Qiong Wu, Pingyi Fan, Nan Cheng, Qiang Fan, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology that enables vehicles to perform high-intensity tasks by executing tasks locally or offloading them to nearby edge devices. However, obstacles such as buildings may degrade the communications and incur communication interruptions, and thus the vehicle may not meet the requirement for task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is introduced to support vehicle communication and provide an alternative communication path. The system performance can be improved by flexibly adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS. For RIS-assisted VEC system where tasks arrive randomly, we design a control scheme that considers offloading power, local power allocation and phase-shift optimization. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that employs modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize the power allocation for vehicle users (VUs) and block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the phase-shift of the RIS. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme and random scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shulin Song, Zheng Zhang, Qiong Wu, Qiang Fan, Pingyi Fan</p>
            <p>Autonomous driving may be the most important application scenario of next generation, the development of wireless access technologies enabling reliable and low-latency vehicle communication becomes crucial. To address this, 3GPP has developed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) specifications based on 5G New Radio (NR) technology, where Mode 2 Side-Link (SL) communication resembles Mode 4 in LTE-V2X, allowing direct communication between vehicles. This supplements SL communication in LTE-V2X and represents the latest advancement in cellular V2X (C-V2X) with improved performance of NR-V2X. However, in NR-V2X Mode 2, resource collisions still occur, and thus degrade the age of information (AOI). Therefore, a interference cancellation method is employed to mitigate this impact by combining NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. In NR-V2X, when vehicles select smaller resource reservation interval (RRI), higher-frequency transmissions take ore energy to reduce AoI. Hence, it is important to jointly consider AoI and communication energy consumption based on NR-V2X communication. Then, we formulate such an optimization problem and employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to compute the optimal transmission RRI and transmission power for each transmitting vehicle to reduce the energy consumption of each transmitting vehicle and the AoI of each receiving vehicle. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the performance of our proposed algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and Optimal Control of State-Triggered Affine Hybrid Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William A. Clark</p>
            <p>A study of the dynamics and control for linear and affine hybrid systems subjected to either temporally- or spatially-triggered resets is presented. Hybrid trajectories are capable of degeneracies not found in continuous-time systems namely beating, blocking, and Zeno. These pathologies are commonly avoided by enforcing a lower bound on the time between events. While this constraint is straightforward to implement for temporally-triggered resets, it is impossible to do so for spatially-triggered systems. In particular, linear spatially-triggered hybrid systems always posses trajectories that are beating and blocking while affine systems may also include Zeno trajectories. The hybrid Pontryagin maximum principle is studied in the context of affine hybrid systems. The existence/uniqueness of the induced co-state jump conditions is studied which introduces the notion of strongly and weakly actuated resets. Finally, optimal control in the context of beating and Zeno is discussed. This work concludes with numerical examples.</p>

            <h2>Using Confidence Scores to Improve Eyes-free Detection of Speech Recognition Errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadia Nowrin, Keith Vertanen</p>
            <p>Conversational systems rely heavily on speech recognition to interpret and respond to user commands and queries. Despite progress on speech recognition accuracy, errors may still sometimes occur and can significantly affect the end-user utility of such systems. While visual feedback can help detect errors, it may not always be practical, especially for people who are blind or low-vision. In this study, we investigate ways to improve error detection by manipulating the audio output of the transcribed text based on the recognizer's confidence level in its result. Our findings show that selectively slowing down the audio when the recognizer exhibited uncertainty led to a 12% relative increase in participants' ability to detect errors compared to uniformly slowing the audio. It also reduced the time it took participants to listen to the recognition result and decide if there was an error by 11%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Qian, Tangyou Liu, Liao Wu</p>
            <p>Follow-the-leader (FTL) motion is essential for continuum robots operating in fragile and confined environments. It allows the robot to exert minimal force on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements, allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ inspection.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces the Raw Natural Image Noise Dataset (RawNIND), a diverse collection of paired raw images designed to support the development of denoising models that generalize across sensors, image development workflows, and styles. Two denoising methods are proposed: one operates directly on raw Bayer data, leveraging computational efficiency, while the other processes linear RGB images for improved generalization to different sensors, with both preserving flexibility for subsequent development. Both methods outperform traditional approaches which rely on developed images. Additionally, the integration of denoising and compression at the raw data level significantly enhances rate-distortion performance and computational efficiency. These findings suggest a paradigm shift toward raw data workflows for efficient and flexible image processing.</p>

            <h2>Online Neural Model Fine-Tuning in Massive MIMO CSI Feedback: Taming The Communication Cost of Model Updates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Sattari, Deniz Gündüz, Tommy Svensson</p>
            <p>Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression is essential in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to the significant feedback overhead. Recently, deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types, including CSI. However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when the data distribution shifts, primarily due to limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose an online model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. We consider full-model fine-tuning, where both the encoder and decoder are jointly updated using recent CSI samples. A key challenge in this setup is the transmission of updated decoder parameters, which introduces additional feedback overhead. To mitigate this bottleneck, we incorporate the bit-rate of model updates into the fine-tuning objective and entropy code the updates jointly with the compressed CSI. To reduce the bit-rate, we design an efficient prior distribution that encourages the network to update only the most significant weights, thereby minimizing the overall model update cost. Our results show that full-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance of neural CSI compression despite the additional communication cost of model updates. Moreover, we investigate the impact of update frequency in dynamic wireless environments and identify an optimal fine-tuning interval that achieves the best RD trade-off.</p>

            <p>In high-noise environments such as factories, subways, and busy streets, capturing clear speech is challenging. Throat microphones can offer a solution because of their inherent noise-suppression capabilities; however, the passage of sound waves through skin and tissue attenuates high-frequency information, reducing speech clarity. Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in enhancing throat microphone recordings, but further progress is constrained by the lack of a standard dataset. Here, we introduce the Throat and Acoustic Paired Speech (TAPS) dataset, a collection of paired utterances recorded from 60 native Korean speakers using throat and acoustic microphones. Furthermore, an optimal alignment approach was developed and applied to address the inherent signal mismatch between the two microphones. We tested three baseline deep learning models on the TAPS dataset and found mapping-based approaches to be superior for improving speech quality and restoring content. These findings demonstrate the TAPS dataset's utility for speech enhancement tasks and support its potential as a standard resource for advancing research in throat microphone-based applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piyushi Manupriya, Himanshu, SakethaNath Jagarlapudi, Ganesh Ghalme</p>
            <p>We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem, a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible expected reward. Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the optimal fair policy and that of the given policy. We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between fairness and social welfare regrets.</p>

This collaborative design empowers EmoAgent to model \emph{one-to-many} emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling semantically diverse and emotionally faithful this http URL quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that EmoAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, effectively generating multiple distinct visual edits that convey the same target emotion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zubair Shaban, Nazreen Shah, Ranjitha Prasad</p>
            <p>In 6G wireless networks, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven applications demand the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) to enable efficient and privacy-preserving model training across distributed devices. Over-The-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) exploits the superposition property of multiple access channels, allowing edge users in 6G networks to efficiently share spectral resources and perform low-latency global model aggregation. However, these advantages come with challenges, as traditional OTA-FL techniques suffer due to the joint effects of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at the server, fading, and both data and system heterogeneity at the participating edge devices. In this work, we propose the novel Noise Resilient Over-the-Air Federated Learning (NoROTA-FL) framework to jointly tackle these challenges in federated wireless networks. In NoROTA-FL, the local optimization problems find controlled inexact solutions, which manifests as an additional proximal constraint at the clients. This approach provides robustness against straggler-induced partial work, heterogeneity, noise, and fading. From a theoretical perspective, we leverage the zeroth- and first-order inexactness and establish convergence guarantees for non-convex optimization problems in the presence of heterogeneous data and varying system capabilities. Experimentally, we validate NoROTA-FL on real-world datasets, including FEMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating its robustness in noisy and heterogeneous environments. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as COTAF and FedProx, NoROTA-FL achieves significantly more stable convergence and higher accuracy, particularly in the presence of stragglers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nahshon Mokua Obiri, Kristof Van Laerhoven</p>
            <p>Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with 2 to 5 components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyao Cui, Qunsong Zeng, Zhanwei Wang, Kaibin Huang</p>
            <p>Harnessing multi-level electron transitions, Rydberg Atomic REceivers (RAREs) can detect wireless signals across a wide range of frequency bands, from Megahertz to Terahertz, enabling multi-band communications and sensing (CommunSense). Current research on multi-band RAREs primarily focuses on experimental demonstrations, lacking a tractable model to mathematically characterize their mechanisms. This issue leaves the multi-band RARE as a black box, posing challenges in its practical CommunSense applications. To fill in this gap, this paper investigates the underlying mechanism of multi-band RAREs and explores their optimal performance. For the first time, the closed-form expression of the transfer function of a multi-band RARE is derived by solving the quantum response of Rydberg atoms excited by multi-band signals. The function reveals that a multi-band RARE simultaneously serves as both a multi-band atomic mixer for down-converting multi-band signals and a multi-band atomic amplifier that reflects its sensitivity to each band. Further analysis of the atomic amplifier unveils that the gain factor at each frequency band can be decoupled into a global gain term and a Rabi attention term. The former determines the overall sensitivity of a RARE to all frequency bands of wireless signals. The latter influences the allocation of the overall sensitivity to each frequency band, representing a unique attention mechanism of multi-band RAREs. The optimal design of the global gain is provided to maximize the overall sensitivity of multi-band RAREs. Subsequently, the optimal Rabi attentions are also derived to maximize the practical multi-band CommunSense performance. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the derived transfer function and the superiority of multi-band RAREs.</p>

            <p>The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

To further reduce cutoff errors, we introduce a novel label delay training scheme. At a fixed median latency of 160 ms, our combined NAC and label delay approach achieves significant relative cutoff error reductions: 42.7% for a single-stream endpointer and 37.5% for a two-stream configuration, compared to baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate efficient integration with a codec-based pretrained speech large language model, improving its median response time by 1200 ms and reducing its cutoff error by 35%.</p>

            <p>With the increasing prevalence of distributed generators, islanded operation based on distributed generation is considered a vital means to enhance the reliability and resilience of smart grids. This paper investigates the main factors in islanding partition of smart grids and establishes a mathematical model for islanding division. A method to determine the maximum power supply range of distributed energy resources (DERs) based on the reachability matrix and power circle algorithm is proposed to improve computational efficiency. A dynamic programming method based on breadth-first search (BFS) is used to solve the islanding partition scheme, and a region correction method is applied to modify the maximum power supply area by considering controllable loads and prioritizing critical load restoration, thereby enhancing system resilience. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving smart grid resilience.</p>

            <p>Modern low-carbon power systems come with many challenges, such as increased inverter penetration and increased uncertainty from renewable sources and loads. In this context, the microgrid concept is a promising approach, which is based on a segmentation of the grid into independent smaller cells that can run either in grid-connected or standalone this http URL microgrids, droop control is widely used for primary control. It enables proportional power sharing, depending on the droop gains. Operation control schemes considering droop control often assume fixed droop gains. However, using adaptive droop gains for grid-forming units allow to shape power sharing in presence of fluctuations, enhancing flexibility while maintaining a safe microgrid operation, particularly under uncertainty. This work introduces a bilinear formulation for microgrid operation control that finds optimal power setpoints and droop gains on a timescale of minutes by solving a finite horizon optimization problem. In detail, a robust minmax model predictive control scheme is designed for a standalone microgrid, comprising a fuel cell, a photovoltaic system and an energy storage. Closed-loop simulations are performed with and without variable droop gains. The results show an increase in renewable utilization of up to 7.5 % while reducing the power output of the fuel cell by 6 %, when allowing variable droop gains.</p>

            <p>As traditional large hydropower has been extensively exploited, micro-hydro systems have caught research increasing interest. New engineering challenges arise in developing micro-hydro systems in areas with significant elevation but prohibitive horizontal distances between primary reservoirs. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a cascade-pumped micro-hydro storage (CPMHS) system that leverages intermediate reservoirs to bridge long horizontal distances, enabling efficient energy transfer and storage. The methodology utilizes naturally occurring lakes with substantial head heights but limited feasibility for direct pumped storage due to horizontal separations. Integrating smaller, strategically placed intermediate reservoirs maximizes energy capture along the cascading path, making pumped storage viable in geographically constrained locations. The proposed system will enhance energy generation potential and provide additional benefits for water management. Using geographical data and a detailed case study focused on Mountain Lake and surrounding lakes, this paper demonstrates the energy efficiency and viability of cascade-based micro-hydro storage. A practical methodology for implementing CPMHS systems is proposed and validated by case studies. An optimization framework is developed for efficient energy capture in regions with challenging topography.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Piansky, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.</p>

            <p>Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as the core of intelligent transportation system, enables comprehensive interconnection between vehicles and their surroundings through multiple communication modes, which is significant for autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.</p>

            <p>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the limitations of centralised machine learning (ML) in oncology, particularly in overcoming privacy concerns and harnessing the power of diverse, multi-center data. This systematic review synthesises current knowledge on the state-of-the-art FL in oncology, focusing on breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Distinct from previous surveys, our comprehensive review critically evaluates the real-world implementation and impact of FL on cancer care, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing ML generalisability, performance and data privacy in clinical settings and data. We evaluated state-of-the-art advances in FL, demonstrating its growing adoption amid tightening data privacy regulations. FL outperformed centralised ML in 15 out of the 25 studies reviewed, spanning diverse ML models and clinical applications, and facilitating integration of multi-modal information for precision medicine. Despite the current challenges identified in reproducibility, standardisation and methodology across studies, the demonstrable benefits of FL in harnessing real-world data and addressing clinical needs highlight its significant potential for advancing cancer research. We propose that future research should focus on addressing these limitations and investigating further advanced FL methods, to fully harness data diversity and realise the transformative power of cutting-edge FL in cancer care.</p>

            <p>Despite recent advancements in music generation systems, their application in film production remains limited, as they struggle to capture the nuances of real-world filmmaking, where filmmakers consider multiple factors-such as visual content, dialogue, and emotional tone-when selecting or composing music for a scene.

To address this gap, we introduce Open Screen Sound Library (OSSL), a dataset consisting of movie clips from public domain films, totaling approximately 36.5 hours, paired with high-quality soundtracks and human-annotated mood information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset in improving the performance of pre-trained models on film music generation tasks, we introduce a new video adapter that enhances an autoregressive transformer-based text-to-music model by adding video-based conditioning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively enhances MusicGen-Medium in terms of both objective measures of distributional and paired fidelity, and subjective compatibility in mood and genre.

            <p>The large-scale access of electric vehicles to the power grid not only provides flexible adjustment resources for the power system, but the temporal uncertainty and distribution complexity of their energy interaction pose significant challenges to the economy and robustness of the micro-energy network. In this paper, we propose a multi-time scale rolling optimization scheduling method for micro-energy networks considering the access of electric vehicles. In order to solve the problem of evaluating the dispatchable potential of electric vehicle clusters, a charging station aggregation model was constructed based on Minkowski summation theory, and the scattered electric vehicle resources were aggregated into virtual energy storage units to participate in system scheduling. Integrate price-based and incentive-based demand response mechanisms to synergistically tap the potential of source-load two-side regulation; On this basis, a two-stage optimal scheduling model of day-ahead and intra-day is constructed. The simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the scale of "preventive curtailment" due to more accurate scheduling, avoids the threat of power shortage to the safety of the power grid, and has more advantages in the efficiency of new energy consumption. At the same time, intra-day scheduling significantly reduces economic penalties and operating costs by avoiding output shortages, and improves the economy of the system in an uncertain forecasting environment.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the economic viability and optimal configuration of a hybrid industrial energy system combining an electrode boiler, steam accumulator, and battery energy storage system (BESS). This study optimizes system operation for a specific configuration to minimize net energy costs, defined as energy costs minus profits from price arbitrage and reserve markets. The optimization uses load shifting, peak shaving, and frequency containment reserve market participation with hourly 2024 data from Norway and Germany. Net present value (NPV) analysis was performed to determine the most cost-efficient energy storage configurations. The results show that current investment costs favor steam accumulators over BESS in both countries. However, a reduction in BESS cost will make batteries economically competitive, particularly in Germany, where high price volatility and power-based grid tariffs provide stronger incentives for load shifting and peak shaving. Participation in the FCR market accounted for a 17% and 7% reduction of the net energy costs in Norway and Germany, respectively. Utilization of excess heat, through inlet water preheating, further reduced the net energy costs. Sensitivity analyses confirm that investment costs, especially for BESS, strongly influence optimal system design. These findings offer guidance for industrial flexibility investments across diverse electricity markets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Miller, Maitraya Avadhut Desai, Xiuqiang He, Roy S. Smith, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Grid-forming inverters control the power transfer between the AC and DC sides of an electrical grid while maintaining the frequency and voltage of the AC side. This paper focuses on ensuring large-signal stability of an electrical grid with inverter-interfaced renewable sources. We prove that the Hybrid-Angle Control (HAC) scheme for grid-forming inverters can exhibit incremental passivity properties between current and voltage at both the AC and DC ports. This incremental passivity can be certified through decentralized conditions. Inverters operating under HAC can, therefore, be connected to other passive elements (e.g. transmission lines) with an immediate guarantee of global transient stability regardless of the network topology or parameters. Passivity of Hybrid Angle Control is also preserved under small-signal (linearized) analyses, in contrast to conventional proportional droop laws that are passivity-short at low frequencies. Passivity and interconnected-stability properties are demonstrated through an example case study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Min-Seung Ko, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>A sustainable electricity infrastructure requires the explicit integration of carbon emissions into power system modeling and optimization paradigms. However, existing open-source datasets for power system R&D lack generator-level carbon emission profiling, limiting the ability to benchmark and compare various carbon-aware grid operational strategies. To address this gap, this work introduces PGLib-CO2, an open-source extension to the widely adopted PGLib-OPF test case library. PGLib-CO2 enriches standard network cases with CO2 and CO2-equivalent emission intensity factors by expanding the fuel-type categorization used by PGLib-OPF, attaining a realistic generator-level carbon profiling. It is also packaged for both Python's pandapower and Julia's this http URL, for a seamless, user-friendly integration of emission modeling into grid computation and optimization tasks. The dataset produced by PGLib-CO2 can support grid-based carbon accounting, emission metric evaluation, and integration into AC optimal power flow (OPF) and optimal load shifting (OLS) formulations. We demonstrate PGLib-CO2's utility through case studies that quantify cost-emission trade-offs and optimize a carbon-aware objective function. By standardizing carbon-enhanced test cases, PGLib-CO2 provides an open-source, reproducible foundation for benchmarking carbon-aware computation, facilitating future research in sustainable power system operation.</p>

            <p>The paper focuses on the numerical stability and accuracy of implicit time-domain integration (TDI) methods when applied for the solution of a power system model impacted by time delays. Such a model is generally formulated as a set of delay differential algebraic equations (DDAEs) in non index-1 Hessenberg form. In particular, the paper shows that numerically stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) methods, such as the trapezoidal and the Theta method, can become unstable when applied to a power system that includes a significant number of delayed variables. Numerical stability is discussed through a scalar test delay differential equation, as well as through a matrix pencil approach that accounts for the DDAEs of any given dynamic power system model. Simulation results are presented in a case study based on the IEEE 39-bus system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Liu, Meng Hua, Guangji Chen, Xinyi Wang, Zesong Fei</p>
            <p>In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.</p>

            <p>Wi-Fi technology has evolved from simple communication routers to sensing devices. Wi-Fi sensing leverages conventional Wi-Fi transmissions to extract and analyze channel state information (CSI) for applications like proximity detection, occupancy detection, activity recognition, and health monitoring. By leveraging existing infrastructure, Wi-Fi sensing offers a privacy-preserving, non-intrusive, and cost-effective solution which, unlike cameras, is not sensitive to lighting conditions. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the Wi-Fi standardization activities, this tutorial-cum-survey first introduces fundamental concepts related to Wi-Fi CSI, outlines the CSI measurement methods, and examines the impact of mobile objects on CSI. The mechanics of a simplified testbed for CSI extraction are also described. Then, we present a qualitative comparison of the existing Wi-Fi sensing datasets, their specifications, and pin-point their shortcomings. Next, a variety of preprocessing techniques are discussed that are beneficial for feature extraction and explainability of machine learning (ML) algorithms. We then provide a qualitative review of recent ML approaches in the domain of Wi-Fi sensing and present the significance of self-supervised learning (SSL) in that context. Specifically, the mechanics of contrastive and non-contrastive learning solutions is elaborated in detail and a quantitative comparative analysis is presented in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, the article concludes by highlighting emerging technologies that can be leveraged to enhance the performance of Wi-Fi sensing and opportunities for further research in this domain</p>

            <h2>C2PO: Coherent Co-packaged Optics using offset-QAM-16 for Beyond PAM-4 Optical I/O</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Sturm, Marzieyh Rezaei, Alana Dee, Sajjad Moazeni</p>
            <p>Co-packaged optics (CPO) has emerged as a promising solution for achieving the ultra-high bandwidths, shoreline densities, and energy efficiencies required by future GPUs and network switches for AI. Microring modulators (MRMs) are well suited for transmitters due to their compact size, high energy efficiency, and natural compatibility with dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM). However, extending beyond the recently demonstrated 200 Gb/s will require more advanced modulation formats, such as higher-order coherent modulation (e.g., QAM-16). In this work, we show how microring resonators (MRMs) can be efficiently used to implement phase-constant amplitude modulators and form the building blocks of a transmitter for offset QAM-16, which has been shown to simplify carrier-phase recovery relative to conventional QAM. We simulate and evaluate the performance of our proposed MRM-based coherent CPO (C2PO) transmitters using a foundry-provided commercial silicon photonics process, demonstrating an input-normalized electric field amplitude contrast of 0.64 per dimension. Through full link-level bit error rate modeling, we show that our design achieves 400 Gb/s using offset QAM-16 at a total optical laser power of 9.65 dBm-comparable to that required by conventional QAM-16 MZI-based links, despite using 10-100x less area. We further conduct a thermal simulation to assess the transmitter's thermal stability at the MRM input optical power required to meet a target BER at the desired data rates. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate 25 Gb/s MRM-based offset QAM-4 modulation with a chip fabricated in the GlobalFoundries 45 nm monolithic silicon photonics process.</p>

            <p>Digital predistortion (DPD) is essential for mitigating nonlinearity in RF power amplifiers, particularly for wideband applications. This paper presents TCN-DPD, a parameter-efficient architecture based on temporal convolutional networks, integrating noncausal dilated convolutions with optimized activation functions. Evaluated on the OpenDPD framework with the DPA_200MHz dataset, TCN-DPD achieves simulated ACPRs of -51.58/-49.26 dBc (L/R), EVM of -47.52 dB, and NMSE of -44.61 dB with 500 parameters and maintains superior linearization than prior models down to 200 parameters, making it promising for efficient wideband PA linearization.</p>

            <p>This brief proposes a distributed formation control strategy via matrix-weighted Laplacian that can achieve a similar formation in 2-D planar using inter-agent relative displacement measurement. Formation patterns that include translation, rotation, and scaling can be characterized by the null space of the matrix-weighted Laplacian associated with the topological graph. The main contribution of this brief is to extend the similar formation problem of undirected graphs to directed acyclic graphs and provide the necessary algebraic criteria for leader selection.

            <p>This paper presents experimental validation of a time-domain load parameter determination method for single-phase circuits. The verification is performed in a state-of-the-art smart grid laboratory equipped with power hardware and real-time emulators. The proposed method enables the identification of circuit parameters using only instantaneous voltage and current measurements at the point of common coupling. The experimental setup includes a range of test cases covering linear and non-sinusoidal single-phase conditions. Voltage and current waveforms are acquired, preprocessed, and used to calculate the relevant circuit parameters. The experimental results demonstrate a high degree of accuracy and robustness, with minimal percentage errors across all test cases. The identified parameters show excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations, confirming the validity and applicability of the proposed method to identify the load of single-phase systems. This validation highlights the potential of the method for improved monitoring, control, and protection of smart grids, paving the way for future extensions to three-phase systems and real-time implementations.</p>

            <h2>ECLIP: Energy-efficient and Practical Co-Location of ML Inference on Spatially Partitioned GPUs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan Quach, Yidi Wang, Ali Jahanshahi, Daniel Wong, Hyoseung Kim</p>
            <p>As AI inference becomes mainstream, research has begun to focus on improving the energy consumption of inference servers. Inference kernels commonly underutilize a GPU's compute resources and waste power from idling components. To improve utilization and energy efficiency, multiple models can co-locate and share the GPU. However, typical GPU spatial partitioning techniques often experience significant overheads when reconfiguring spatial partitions, which can waste additional energy through repartitioning overheads or non-optimal partition configurations. In this paper, we present ECLIP, a framework to enable low-overhead energy-efficient kernel-wise resource partitioning between co-located inference kernels. ECLIP minimizes repartitioning overheads by pre-allocating pools of CU masked streams and assigns optimal CU assignments to groups of kernels through our resource allocation optimizer. Overall, ECLIP achieves an average of 13% improvement to throughput and 25% improvement to energy efficiency.</p>

            <p>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into sub-transmission systems has enabled new opportunities for flexibility provision in ancillary services such as frequency and voltage support, as well as congestion management. This paper investigates the stability and performance of Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controllers in ensuring reliable flexibility provision. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed, emphasizing safe transitions between system states within the Feasible Operating Region (FOR). We evaluate the controller's stability and performance through simulations of transitions to the vertices of the FOR, analyzing the impact of tuning parameters. The study demonstrates that controller stability is sensitive to parameter tuning, particularly gain and sensitivity approximations. Results demonstrate that improper tuning can lead to oscillatory or unstable behavior, highlighting the need for systematic parameter selection to ensure reliable operation across the full flexibility range.</p>

            <h2>Aggregating Inverter-Based Resources for Fast Frequency Response: A Nash Bargaining Game-Based Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhu, Hua Geng, Hongyang Qing, Xin Zou</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach for grid-level frequency regulation by aggregating inverter-based resources (IBRs). Virtual power plants (VPPs), acting as aggregators, can efficiently respond to dynamic response requirements from the grid. Through parametric modeling, grid-level frequency regulation requirements are accurately quantified and translated into a feasible parameter region defined by device-level parameters. Based on this feasible region, an MOO model is developed to address the conflicting demands of IBRs during frequency response. A Nash bargaining game-based approach is then employed to optimally allocate regulation requirements within the VPP, balancing the various demands of the IBRs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing frequency stability and improving coordination among IBRs.</p>

            <h2>Voltage Stability of Inverter-Based Systems: Impact of Parameters and Irrelevance of Line Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sushobhan Chatterjee, Sijia Geng</p>
            <p>This paper investigates voltage stability in inverter-based power systems concerning fold and saddle-node bifurcations. An analytical expression is derived for the sensitivity of the stability margin using the normal vector to the bifurcation hypersurface. Such information enables efficient identification of effective control parameters in mitigating voltage instability. Comprehensive analysis reveals that reactive loading setpoint and current controller's feedforward gain are the most influential parameters for enhancing voltage stability in a grid-following (GFL) inverter system, while the voltage controller's feedforward gain plays a dominant role in a grid-forming (GFM) inverter. Notably, both theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that transmission line dynamics have no impact on fold/saddle-node bifurcations in these systems. Results in this paper provide insights for efficient analysis and control in future inverter-dominated power systems through reductions in parameter space and model complexity.</p>

            <p>We consider trajectory tracking for minimum-phase nonlinear systems in Byrnes-Isidori form using the model-following control (MFC) architecture. The tracking problem is motivated by a hierarchical control concept where a higher-level instance provides the reference trajectory at run-time. We present a computational efficient implementation of the feedback linearisation MFC design, and apply high-gain feedback in the process control loop (PCL) to achieve practical tracking in presence of Lipschitz perturbations. Our main results establish ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and give a constructive bound for the high-gain scaling parameter to achieve arbitrary tracking precision. Further we establish that the peaking phenomenon can be attenuated using MFC. We demonstrate the results via an automotive case study considering advanced engine-based cruise control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjin Lv, Chenggang Cui, Shaodi Zhang, Hui Chen, Chunyang Gong, Jiaming Liu</p>
            <p>The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a classic challenge in the optimal scheduling of power systems. Years of research and practice have shown that formulating reasonable unit commitment plans can significantly improve the economic efficiency of power systems' operations. In recent years, with the introduction of technologies such as machine learning and the Lagrangian relaxation method, the solution methods for the UC problem have become increasingly diversified, but still face challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. This paper proposes a Function Space Search (FunSearch) method based on large language models. This method combines pre-trained large language models and evaluators to creatively generate solutions through the program search and evolution process while ensuring their rationality. In simulation experiments, a case of unit commitment with \(10\) units is used mainly. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the results show that FunSearch performs better in terms of sampling time, evaluation time, and total operating cost of the system, demonstrating its great potential as an effective tool for solving the UC problem.</p>

            <p>Accurately modeling consumer behavior in energy operations remains challenging due to inherent uncertainties, behavioral complexities, and limited empirical data. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging generative agents--artificial agents powered by large language models--to realistically simulate customer decision-making in dynamic energy operations. We demonstrate that these agents behave more optimally and rationally in simpler market scenarios, while their performance becomes more variable and suboptimal as task complexity rises. Furthermore, the agents exhibit heterogeneous customer preferences, consistently maintaining distinct, persona-driven reasoning patterns. Our findings highlight the potential value of integrating generative agents into energy management simulations to improve the design and effectiveness of energy policies and incentive programs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pantelis Dogoulis, Karim Tit, Maxime Cordy</p>
            <p>In the modern context of power systems, rapid, scalable, and physically plausible power flow predictions are essential for ensuring the grid's safe and efficient operation. While traditional numerical methods have proven robust, they require extensive computation to maintain physical fidelity under dynamic or contingency conditions. In contrast, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved computational speed; however, they often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws during real-world contingencies, resulting in physically implausible predictions. In this work, we introduce KCLNet, a physics-informed graph neural network that incorporates Kirchhoff's Current Law as a hard constraint via hyperplane projections. KCLNet attains competitive prediction accuracy while ensuring zero KCL violations, thereby delivering reliable and physically consistent power flow predictions critical to secure the operation of modern smart grids.</p>

            <h2>Distributed Attack-Resilient Platooning Against False Data Injection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Lyons, Manuel Boldrer, Laura Ferranti</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel distributed vehicle platooning control and coordination strategy. We propose a distributed predecessor-follower CACC scheme that allows to choose an arbitrarily small inter-vehicle distance while guaranteeing no rear-end collisions occur, even in the presence of undetected cyber-attacks on the communication channels such as false data injection. The safety guarantees of the CACC policy are derived by combining a sensor-based ACC policy that explicitly accounts for actuator saturation, and a communication-based predictive term that has state-dependent limits on its control authority, thus containing the effects of an unreliable communication channel. An undetected attack may still however be able to degrade platooning performance. To mitigate it, we propose a tailored Kalman observer-based attack detection algorithm that initially triggers a switch from the CACC policy to the ACC policy. Subsequently, by relying on a high-level coordinator, our strategy allows to isolate a compromised vehicle from the platoon formation by reconfiguring the platoon topology itself. The coordinator can also handle merging and splitting requests. We compare our algorithm in an extensive simulation study against a state of the art distributed MPC scheme and a robust control scheme. We additionally extensively test our full method in practice on a real system, a team of scaled-down car-like robots. Furthermore, we share the code to run both the simulations and robotic experiments.</p>

            <p>We propose a self-refining framework that enhances ASR performance with only unlabeled datasets. The process starts with an existing ASR model generating pseudo-labels on unannotated speech, which are then used to train a high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) system. Then, synthesized speech text pairs are bootstrapped into the original ASR system, completing the closed-loop self-improvement cycle. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework on Taiwanese Mandarin speech. Leveraging 6,000 hours of unlabeled speech, a moderate amount of text data, and synthetic content from the AI models, we adapt Whisper-large-v2 into a specialized model, Twister. Twister reduces error rates by up to 20% on Mandarin and 50% on Mandarin-English code-switching benchmarks compared to Whisper. Results highlight the framework as a compelling alternative to pseudo-labeling self-distillation approaches and provides a practical pathway for improving ASR performance in low-resource or domain-specific settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Yang, Xiaoyu Peng, Xi Ru, Hua Geng, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>Traditional centralized stability analysis struggles with scalability in large complex modern power grids. This two-part paper proposes a compositional and equilibrium-free approach to analyzing power system stability. In Part I, we prove that using equilibrium-free local conditions we can certificate system-wide stability of power systems with heterogeneous nonlinear devices and structure-preserving lossy networks. This is built on a recently developed notion of delta dissipativity, which yields local stability conditions without knowing the system-wide equilibrium. As a consequence, our proposed theory can certificate stability of equilibria set rather than single equilibrium. In Part I, we verify our theory and demonstrate promising implications by the single machine single load benchmark, which helps to better explain the compositional and equilibrium-set-oriented stability analysis. Part II of this paper will provide methods for applying our theory to complex power grids, together with case studies across a wide range of system scales. Our results enable a more scalable and adaptable approach to stability analysis. It also sheds light on how to regulate grid-connected devices to guarantee system-wide stability.</p>

            <p>The rapid integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into power systems has identified frequency security challenges due to reduced inertia and increased load volatility. This paper proposes a robust power reserve decision-making approach for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPPs) to address these challenges, especially under temporally sequential and uncertain disturbances. An analytical model is developed to characterize the system's frequency response dynamics, enabling the quantification of virtual inertia and virtual damping requirements to meet rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), frequency nadir, and steady-state deviation constraints. By analytically deriving the regulation power dynamics, the required virtual inertia and damping parameters for the DVPP are determined in a robust way. Then, the total power reserve decision is made by optimally allocating the parameters and calculating the actual power reserves for IBRs, fully considering their economic diversity. Finally, case studies conducted on an IEEE nine-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results indicate the high reliability of the proposed approach in ensuring frequency security.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur Brigatto, Alexandre Street, Cristiano Fernandes, Davi Valladao, Guilherme Bodin, Joaquim Dias Garcia</p>
            <p>Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 61.4% of Brazil's total generation in 2024 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, inflow forecasting plays a critical role in the operation, planning, and market in this country, as well as in any other hydro-dependent power system. These forecasts influence generation schedules, reservoir management, and market pricing, shaping the dynamics of the entire electricity sector. The objective of this paper is to measure and present empirical evidence of a systematic optimistic bias in the official inflow forecast methodology, which is based on the PAR(p)-A model. Additionally, we discuss possible sources of this bias and recommend ways to mitigate it. By analyzing 14 years of historical data from the Brazilian system through rolling-window multistep (out-of-sample) forecasts, results indicate that the official forecast model exhibits statistically significant biases of 6%, 14%, 20%, and 24% for 1-, 6-, 12-, and 24-step-ahead forecasts in the Southeast subsystem, and 19%, 57%, 81%, and 109% in the Northeast subsystem. These findings uncover the limitations of current inflow forecasting methodologies used in Brazil and call for new governance and monitoring policies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanthan Kumar Padisala, Satadru Dey</p>
            <p>In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongfei Li, Francis Assadian</p>
            <p>Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.</p>

            <p>This work proposes an automatic control solution for the operation of conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as energy-autonomous water resource recovery facilities. We first conceptualize a classification of the quality of treated water for three resource recovery applications (environmental, industrial, and agricultural water reuse). We then present an output-feedback model predictive controller (Output MPC) that operates a plant to produce water of specific quality class, while also producing sufficient biogas to ensure nonpositive energy costs. The controller is demonstrated in the long-term operation of a full-scale WWTP subjected to typical influent loads and periodically changing quality targets. Our results provide a proof-of-concept on the energy-autonomous operation of existing wastewater treatment infrastructure with control strategies that are general enough to accommodate a wide range of resource recovery objectives.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility, the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial flexibility planning under uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Various domains such as power system stability analysis, electric machine modeling, and control of power electronic converters have significantly benefited from the application of coordinate transformations. One of the main benefits is the dimensional reduction, which reduces the complexity of the problems. This paper introduces a novel general transformation based on a geometric framework that directly identifies the plane containing the locus for unbalanced quantities through bivector analysis using Geometric Algebra. The proposed method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems. The transformation requires only two measurements (voltage or current) taken at different time instants, making it computationally efficient. Moreover, we demonstrate through pure geometric reasoning that our approach is general and encompasses other techniques, such as the classical Clarke transformation. Numerical simulations and experimental validation using a real-time digital simulator and a physical laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This generalization to multi-dimensional systems, combined with the reduced measurement requirements, represents a significant advancement over existing approaches that are typically restricted to three-phase applications or suffer from computational limitations.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Voltage Control Using Online Exponential Barrier Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhang, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper address the optimal voltage control problem of distribution systems with high penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources, under inaccurate model information. We propose the online exponential barrier method that explicitly leverages the online feedback from grids to enhance the robustness to model inaccuracy and incorporates the voltage constraints to maintain the safety requirements. We provide analytical results on the optimal barrier parameter selection and sufficient conditions for the safety guarantee of converged voltages. We also establish theoretical results on the exponential convergence rate with proper step-size. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 56-bus radial network, where we significantly improve the robustness against model inaccuracy compared to existing methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Latif U. Khan, Maher Guizani, Sami Muhaidat, Choong Seon Hong</p>
            <p>The rapid advancement of wireless networks has resulted in numerous challenges stemming from their extensive demands for quality of service towards innovative quality of experience metrics (e.g., user-defined metrics in terms of sense of physical experience for haptics applications). In the meantime, large language models (LLMs) emerged as promising solutions for many difficult and complex applications/tasks. These lead to a notion of the integration of LLMs and wireless networks. However, this integration is challenging and needs careful attention in design. Therefore, in this article, we present a notion of rational wireless networks powered by \emph{telecom LLMs}, namely, \emph{LLM-native wireless systems}. We provide fundamentals, vision, and a case study of the distributed implementation of LLM-native wireless systems. In the case study, we propose a solution based on double deep Q-learning (DDQN) that outperforms existing DDQN solutions. Finally, we provide open challenges.</p>

            <h2>Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Ramírez-Espinosa, David Morales-Jiménez, Beatriz Soret</p>
            <p>Motivated by the stringent and challenging need for `greener communications' in increasingly power-hungry 5G networks, this paper presents a detailed energy efficiency analysis for three different multi-antenna architectures, namely fully-digital arrays, hybrid arrays, and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). By leveraging a circuital model, which captures mutual coupling, insertion losses, propagation through the waveguides in DMAs and other electromagnetic phenomena, we design a transmit Wiener filter solution for the three systems. We then use these results to analyze the energy efficiency, considering different consumption models and supplied power, and with particular focus on the impact of the physical phenomena. DMAs emerge as an efficient alternative to classical arrays across diverse tested scenarios, most notably under low transmission power, strong coupling, and scalability requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Aboudonia, Johannes Estermann, Keith Moffat, Manfred Morari, John Lygeros</p>
            <p>We aim to improve the energy efficiency of train climate control architectures, with a focus on a specific class of regional trains operating throughout Switzerland, especially in Zurich and Geneva. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems represent the second largest energy consumer in these trains after traction. The current architecture comprises a high-level rule-based controller and a low-level tracking controller. To improve train energy efficiency, we propose adding a middle data-driven predictive control layer aimed at minimizing HVAC energy consumption while maintaining passenger comfort. The scheme incorporates a multistep prediction model developed using real-world data collected from a limited number of train coaches. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we conduct multiple experiments on a separate set of train coaches; our results suggest energy savings between 10% and 35% with respect to the current architecture.</p>

            <p>Electrified transportation leads to a tighter integration between transportation and energy distribution systems. In this work, we develop scalable optimization models to co-design hydrogen and battery electric vehicle (EV) fleets, distributed energy resources, and fast-charging and hydrogen-fueling infrastructure to efficiently meet transportation demands. A novel integer-clustering formulation is used for optimizing fleet-level EV operation while maintaining accurate individual vehicle dispatch, which significantly improves the computation efficiency with guaranteed performance. We apply the optimization model to Boston's public transit bus network using real geospatial data and cost parameters. Realistic insights are provided into the future evolution of coupled electricity-transportation-hydrogen systems, including the effects of electricity price structure, hydrogen fuel cost, carbon emission constraint, temperature effects on EV range, and distribution system upgrade cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Tönges, Philipp Härtel, Martin Braun</p>
            <p>An approach is proposed to identify optimal asset protection strategies based on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Traditional bilevel attacker-defender models emphasize worstcase scenarios but offer limited defensive guidance. In contrast, trilevel models introduce high computational complexity and rely on fixed network configurations. The proposed critical-components method leverages vulnerability assessment results to determine protection strategies, effectively outsourcing the upper-level defense decision. This enables adaptability to diverse network topologies, assessment techniques, and cyber-physical energy systems without the overhead of multi-level optimization. Case studies demonstrate the potential for improved system resilience across varying operational conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asad Mahmood, Thang X. Vu, Wali Ullah Khan, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten</p>
            <p>This work proposes a framework for the robust design of UAV-assisted wireless networks that combine 3D trajectory optimization with user mobility prediction to address dynamic resource allocation challenges. We proposed a sparse second-order prediction model for real-time user tracking coupled with heuristic user clustering to balance service quality and computational complexity. The joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum rate. It is then decomposed into user association, 3D trajectory design, and resource allocation subproblems, which are solved iteratively via successive convex approximation (SCA). Extensive simulations demonstrate: (1) near-optimal performance with $\epsilon \approx 0.67\%$ deviation from upper-bound solutions, (2) $16\%$ higher minimum rates for distant users compared to non-predictive 3D designs, and (3) $10-30\%$ faster outage mitigation than time-division benchmarks. The framework's adaptive speed control enables precise mobile user tracking while maintaining energy efficiency under constrained flight time. Results demonstrate superior robustness in edge-coverage scenarios, making it particularly suitable for $5G/6G$ networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Pierron, Michel Barbeau, Luca De Cicco, Jose Rubio-Hernan, Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.</p>

            <p>Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy.

Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.</p>

            <p>The ability to flexibly leverage limbs for loco-manipulation is essential for enabling autonomous robots to operate in unstructured environments. Yet, prior work on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or predetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement Learning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile loco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our approach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of manipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands. Through the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns each limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to achieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation, ReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals in the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to interface the learned controller with different types of task specifications, including target trajectories, contact points, and natural language instructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex coordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by achieving a success rate of 78.9% on average.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huy Truong-Ba, Jacky Chin, Michael E. Cholette, Pietro Borghesani</p>
            <p>Track geometry monitoring is essential for maintaining the safety and efficiency of railway operations. While Track Recording Cars (TRCs) provide accurate measurements of track geometry indicators, their limited availability and high operational costs restrict frequent monitoring across large rail networks. Recent advancements in on-board sensor systems installed on in-service trains offer a cost-effective alternative by enabling high-frequency, albeit less accurate, data collection. This study proposes a method to enhance the reliability of track geometry predictions by integrating low-accuracy sensor signals with degradation models through a Kalman filter framework. An experimental campaign using a low-cost sensor system mounted on a TRC evaluates the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that incorporating frequent sensor data significantly reduces prediction uncertainty, even when the data is noisy. The study also investigates how the frequency of data recording influences the size of the credible prediction interval, providing guidance on the optimal deployment of on-board sensors for effective track monitoring and maintenance planning.</p>

            <p>The decarbonization goals worldwide drive the energy transition of power distribution grids, which operate under increasingly volatile conditions and closer to their technical limits. In this context, localized operational data with high temporal and spatial resolution is essential for their effective planning and regulation. Nevertheless, information on grid-connected distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and heat pumps, is often fragmented, inconsistent, and unavailable. This work introduces a comprehensive database of distributed energy resources and non-controllable loads allocated in Switzerland's medium- and low-voltage distribution grid models, covering over 2 million points of connection. Remarkably, this data specifies the flexibility capabilities of the controllable devices, with a set of projections aligned with national forecasts for 2030, 2040, and 2050. The database supports studies on flexibility provision of distributed energy resources, distribution grid resilience, and national energy policy, among other topics. Importantly, its modular structure allows users to extract national- and local-scale information across medium- and low-voltage systems, enabling broad applicability across locations.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative Indices for Improving Metro Load Curve, Using Distributed Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masoud Behbahani, Alireza Fereidunian</p>
            <p>This paper promises the idea of using DG (Distributed Generation) to improve the Metro load curve. Public transportation systems are often based on gasoline and diesel. However, with the gradual development in usage of the Metro and monorail, a new load with heavy demand, inappropriate load curve and middle LF (Load factor) is added to the electricity grid. In addition to supply problem of this massive consumer, the Metro load curve is another problem, which has a relatively low LF. Furthermore, Metro load peak hours coincide with the peaks of national grid. Improvement of the load curve is well-known in electrical engineering literature, which depending on the type of load curve, offers general recommendations in three approaches; DSM (Demand Side Management), DS (Distributed Storage) and DG. In this paper, to achieve quantitative indices of improvement for Metro load curve using DG, firstly based on the analysis of volume and consumption pattern of the main loads in Metro, the typical load curve has been extracted. Using this curve, the result of using DG is shown by quantitative parameters which represent the significant improvement in load curve. These parameters can be used to calculate economic indicators such as initial cost and ROI (Return of Investment).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiya Gada, Rupamathi Jaddivada, Marija Ilic</p>
            <p>The widespread deployment of power electronic-based technologies is transforming modern power systems into fast, nonlinear, and heterogeneous systems. Conventional modeling and control approaches, rooted in quasi-static analysis and centralized control, are inadequate for these converter-dominated systems, which operate on fast timescales and involve proprietary models of diverse components. This paper adopts and extends a previously introduced energy space modeling framework grounded in energy conservation principles to address these challenges. We generalize the notion of a port interaction variable, which encodes energy exchange between interconnected, heterogeneous components in a unified and physically intuitive manner. A multilayered distributed control architecture is proposed, wherein the nonlinear physical dynamics of each component are lifted to a higher-level linear energy space through well-defined mappings. Distributed controllers are designed in this energy space using only local states and minimal neighbor information via port interaction variables. Two control designs, energy-based feedback linearizing control (FBLC) and sliding mode control (SMC), are proven to achieve asymptotic convergence to reference outputs. The approach is validated on two systems: an inverter-controlled RLC circuit and a synchronous generator connected to a load. In both cases, energy-based control improves transient response and reduces control effort.</p>

            <h2>Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA) for Enabled Flexible PONs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Lian, Xiao Han, Xinmao Deng</p>
            <p>With the commercial deployment of 5G and the in-depth research of 6G, the demand for high-speed data services in the next-generation fiber optic access systems is growing increasingly. Passive optical networks (PONs) have become a research hotspot due to their characteristics of low loss, high bandwidth, and low cost. However, the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA-PON) has difficulty meeting the requirements of the next-generation PON for high spectral efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, a novel transmission technology, namely power-domain sparse dimension constellation multiple access (PD-SDCMA), is proposed for the first time. Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy) in the high-dimensional signal space, the low-dimensional constellation is sparsely superimposed into the high-dimensional space, thereby reducing multi-user interference and enhancing the system capacity. PD-SDCMA supports higher-order modulation formats and more access groups, and is also compatible with the existing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture. The simulation results show that in a 25 km single-mode fiber system, compared with PD-NOMA and 3D-NOMA, PD-SDCMA can support more users and significantly reduce BER. This technology provides an efficient and low-cost solution for the evolution of Flexible PONs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex D. Hayes, Ryan J. Caverly</p>
            <p>This paper presents an estimation and control framework that enables the targeted reentry of a drag-modulated spacecraft in the presence of atmospheric density uncertainty. In particular, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate the in-flight density errors relative to the atmospheric density used to generate the nominal guidance trajectory. This information is leveraged within a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to improve tracking performance, reduce control effort, and increase robustness to actuator saturation compared to the state-of-the-art approach. The estimation and control framework is tested in a Monte Carlo simulation campaign with historical space weather data. These simulation efforts demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to stay within 100 km of the guidance trajectory at all points in time for 98.4% of cases. The remaining 1.6% of cases were pushed away from the guidance by large density errors, many due to significant solar storms and flares, that could not physically be compensated for by the drag control device. For the successful cases, the proposed framework was able to guide the spacecraft to the desired location at the entry interface altitude with a mean error of 12.1 km and 99.7% of cases below 100 km.</p>

            <p>A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. Here we review 24 papers that document field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</p>

In this work, we consider a wireless communication system with secret-key generation, in which the secret-key bits are added to and used from a pool of available key bits. We propose novel physical layer resilience metrics for the survivability of such systems. In addition, we propose multiple power allocation schemes and analyze their trade-off between resilience and power consumption. In particular, we investigate and compare constant power allocation, an adaptive analytical algorithm, and a reinforcement learning-based solution. It is shown how the transmit power can be minimized such that a specified resilience is guaranteed. These results can be used directly by designers of such systems to optimize the system parameters for the desired performance in terms of reliability, security, and resilience.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maurizio Clemente, Prapti Maharjan, Mauro Salazar, Theo Hofman</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the environmental impact of Li-Ion batteries by quantifying manufacturing-related emissions and analyzing how electricity mix and production scale affect emission intensity. To this end, we conduct a meta-analysis of life cycle assessments on lithium-ion batteries published over the past two decades, categorizing them by year, battery chemistry, functional unit, system boundaries, and electricity mix. We then carry out a cradle-to-gate assessment for a nickel manganese cobalt 811 battery with a silicon-coated graphite anode, analyzing how variations in the carbon intensity of the electricity mix affect emissions, with case studies for China, South Korea, and Sweden. Finally, we develop a set of regression models that link annual battery production and the carbon intensity of China's electricity mix to the average mass-specific emissions observed each year. The meta-analysis shows a median global warming potential of 17.63 kg CO2-eq./kg of battery, with a standard deviation of 7.34. Differences in electricity mix mainly influence emissions from the energy-intensive cell production, particularly from cathode material processing. We found that a multivariate linear regression using production volume and the carbon intensity of the Chinese electricity mix as predictors explains emissions with moderate accuracy. The environmental impact of battery manufacturing can be reduced by using clean energy sources in production processes. However, achieving substantial reductions requires clean energy throughout the entire supply chain, as importing materials from regions with carbon-intensive electricity mixes can undermine these efforts. Our findings also highlight the emission-reducing effect of learning associated with increased production scale, supporting the integration of learning effects in future life cycle assessment models.</p>

The objective is to achieve more accurate, intelligent, and efficient maintenance in industrial applications. Two realistic implementations, involving the maintenance of telecommunication equipment rooms and the intelligent servicing of energy storage power stations, demonstrate that the framework significantly enhances maintenance efficiency.</p>

            <p>In the context of building electrification, the operation of distributed energy resources integrating multiple energy carriers (electricity, heat, mobility) poses a significant challenge due to the nonlinear device dynamics, uncertainty, and computational issues. As such, energy management systems seek to decide set points for the primary control layer in the best way possible. The objective is to minimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with user requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). This paper presents a novel aging-aware day-ahead algorithm for electrified buildings. The proposed energy management algorithm incorporates physics-based battery aging models to enhance the operational performance, making explicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation. The proposed day-ahead algorithm can either cut-down on grid costs or extend battery lifetime (electric vehicle or static packs). Moreover, it exploits the differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25\% when using LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells. Finally the performance using aged batteries is also enhanced, with respect to the benchmarks.</p>

            <h2>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Guo, Harsha Nagarajan, Merve Bodur</p>
            <p>The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</p>

            <h2>NILMFormer: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring that Accounts for Non-Stationarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrien Petralia, Philippe Charpentier, Youssef Kadhi, Themis Palpanas</p>
            <p>Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches. Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's (Electricité De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power consumption.

            <h2>Experience Paper: Scaling WiFi Sensing to Millions of Commodity Devices for Ubiquitous Home Monitoring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guozhen Zhu, Yuqian Hu, Chenshu Wu, Wei-Hsiang Wang, Beibei Wang, K. J. Ray Liu</p>
            <p>WiFi-based home monitoring has emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional camera- and sensor-based solutions, offering wide coverage with minimal intrusion by leveraging existing wireless infrastructure. This paper presents key insights and lessons learned from developing and deploying a large-scale WiFi sensing solution, currently operational across over 10 million commodity off-the-shelf routers and 100 million smart bulbs worldwide. Through this extensive deployment, we identify four real-world challenges that hinder the practical adoption of prior research: 1) Non-human movements (e.g., pets) frequently trigger false positives; 2) Low-cost WiFi chipsets and heterogeneous hardware introduce inconsistencies in channel state information (CSI) measurements; 3) Motion interference in multi-user environments complicates occupant differentiation; 4) Computational constraints on edge devices and limited cloud transmission impede real-time processing. To address these challenges, we present a practical and scalable system, validated through comprehensive two-year evaluations involving 280 edge devices, across 16 scenarios, and over 4 million motion samples. Our solutions achieve an accuracy of 92.61% in diverse real-world homes while reducing false alarms due to non-human movements from 63.1% to 8.4% and lowering CSI transmission overhead by 99.72%. Notably, our system integrates sensing and communication, supporting simultaneous WiFi sensing and data transmission over home WiFi networks. While focused on home monitoring, our findings and strategies generalize to various WiFi sensing applications. By bridging the gaps between theoretical research and commercial deployment, this work offers practical insights for scaling WiFi sensing in real-world environments.</p>

            <h2>DAS-MAE: A self-supervised pre-training framework for universal and high-performance representation learning of distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyi Duan, Jiageng Chen, Zuyuan He</p>
            <p>Distributed fiber-optic acoustic sensing (DAS) has emerged as a transformative approach for distributed vibration measurement with high spatial resolution and long measurement range while maintaining cost-efficiency. However, the two-dimensional spatial-temporal DAS signals present analytical challenges. The abstract signal morphology lacking intuitive physical correspondence complicates human interpretation, and its unique spatial-temporal coupling renders conventional image processing methods suboptimal. This study investigates spatial-temporal characteristics and proposes a self-supervised pre-training framework that learns signals' representations through a mask-reconstruction task. This framework is named the DAS Masked AutoEncoder (DAS-MAE). The DAS-MAE learns high-level representations (e.g., event class) without using labels. It achieves up to 1% error and 64.5% relative improvement (RI) over the semi-supervised baseline in few-shot classification tasks. In a practical external damage prevention application, DAS-MAE attains a 5.0% recognition error, marking a 75.7% RI over supervised training from scratch. These results demonstrate the high-performance and universal representations learned by the DAS-MAE framework, highlighting its potential as a foundation model for analyzing massive unlabeled DAS signals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Vanin, Frederik Geth, Rahmat Heidari, Dirk Van Hertem</p>
            <p>The impedances of cables and lines used in (multi-conductor) distribution networks are usually unknown or approximated, and may lead to problematic results for any physics-based power system calculation, e.g., (optimal) power flow. Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.</p>

            <p>As distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV, batteries and electric vehicles become increasingly prevalent at the edge, maintaining grid stability requires advanced monitoring and control mechanisms. This paper presents a scalable smart grid gateway architecture that enables interoperability between Modbus-based inverters and IEEE 2030.5 cloud-based control systems. The proposed solution leverages Azure cloud services and edge-computing gateway devices to support dynamic configuration, telemetry ingestion, remote control and Volt-VAR Curve deployment. A microservice-based architecture ensures flexibility and scalability across diverse deployment scenarios, including both gateway-mediated and direct-to-cloud device communication. Results demonstrate the successful mapping of a Fronius Primo inverter's Modbus registers to IEEE 2030.5-compliant telemetry and control functions. Additionally, we evaluate real-time VVC updates and their impact on local voltage regulation, showcasing dynamic cloud-to-edge control with minimal latency. This work highlights the potential of virtualised, standards-based control infrastructures to support DER integration and active grid participation, while remaining adaptable to evolving smart grid architectures.</p>

            <h2>Bilevel Optimization for Improved Flexibility Aggregation Models of Electric Vehicle Fleets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Härtel, Michael von Bonin</p>
            <p>Electric vehicle (EV) fleets are expected to become an increasingly important source of flexibility for power system operations. However, accurately capturing the flexibility potential of numerous and heterogeneous EVs remains a significant challenge. We propose a bilevel optimization formulation to enhance flexibility aggregations of electric vehicle fleets. The outer level minimizes scheduling deviations between the aggregated and reference EV units, while the inner level maximizes the aggregated unit's profits. Our approach introduces hourly to daily scaling factor mappings to parameterize the aggregated EV units. Compared to simple aggregation methods, the proposed framework reduces the root-mean-square error of charging power by 78~per cent, providing more accurate flexibility representations. The proposed framework also provides a foundation for several potential extensions in future work.</p>

            <h2>A Causation-Based Framework for Pricing and Cost Allocation of Energy, Reserves, and Transmission in Modern Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luiza Ribeiro, Alexandre Street, Jose Manuel Arroyo, Rodrigo Moreno</p>
            <p>The increasing vulnerability of power systems has heightened the need for operating reserves to manage contingencies such as generator outages, line failures, and sudden load variations. Unlike energy costs, driven by consumer demand, operating reserve costs arise from addressing the most critical credible contingencies - prompting the question: how should these costs be allocated through efficient pricing mechanisms? As an alternative to previously reported schemes, this paper presents a new causation-based pricing framework for electricity markets based on contingency-constrained energy and reserve scheduling models. Major salient features include a novel security charge mechanism along with the explicit definition of prices for up-spinning reserves, down-spinning reserves, and transmission services. These features ensure more comprehensive and efficient cost-reflective market operations. Moreover, the proposed nodal pricing scheme yields revenue adequacy and neutrality while promoting reliability incentives for generators based on the cost-causation principle. An additional salient aspect of the proposed framework is the economic incentive for transmission assets, which are remunerated based on their use to deliver energy and reserves across all contingency states. Numerical results from two case studies illustrate the performance of the proposed pricing scheme.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sonia Martin, Obidike Nnorom Jr., Philip Levis, Ram Rajagopal</p>
            <p>Residential electric vehicle charging causes large spikes in electricity demand that risk violating neighborhood transformer power limits. Battery energy storage systems reduce these transformer limit violations, but operating them individually is not cost-optimal. Instead of individual optimization, aggregating, or sharing, these batteries leads to cost-optimal performance, but homeowners must relinquish battery control. This paper leverages virtualization to propose battery sharing optimization schemes to reduce electricity costs, extend the lifetime of a residential transformer, and maintain homeowner control over the battery. A case study with simulated home loads, solar generation, and electric vehicle charging profiles demonstrates that joint, or shared, optimization reduces consumer bills by 56% and transformer aging by 48% compared to individual optimization. Hybrid and dynamic optimization schemes that provide owners with autonomy have similar transformer aging reduction but are slightly less cost-effective. These results suggest that controlling shared batteries with virtualization is an effective way to delay transformer upgrades in the face of growing residential electric vehicle charging penetration.</p>

            <p>CubeSats offer a low-cost platform for space research, particularly for Earth observation. However, their resource-constrained nature and being in space, challenge the flexibility and complexity of the deployed image processing pipelines and their orchestration.

DIPP is a modular and configurable image processing pipeline framework that allows for adaptability to changing mission goals even after deployment, while preserving robustness. DISH is a domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime system designed to schedule complex imaging workloads on low-power and memory-constrained processors. Our experiments demonstrate that DIPP's decomposition of the processing pipelines adds negligible overhead, while significantly reducing the network requirements of updating pipelines and being robust against erroneous module uploads. Furthermore, we compare DISH to Lua, a general purpose scripting language, and demonstrate its comparable expressiveness and lower memory requirement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel O. Badmus, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>This paper presents a \textit{physics-based} steady-state equivalent circuit model of a two-stage bidirectional inverter. These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses, ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power, and iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose a physics-first model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components based on circuit-level principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems.

            <h2>Nonlinear Optimal Control of DC Microgrids with Safety and Stability Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muratkhan Abdirash, Xiaofan Cui</p>
            <p>A DC microgrid is a promising alternative to the traditional AC power grid, since it can efficiently integrate distributed and renewable energy resources. However, as an emerging framework, it lacks the rigorous theoretical guarantees of its AC counterpart. In particular, safe stabilization of the DC microgrid has been a non-trivial task in power electronics. To address that, we take a control theoretic perspective in designing the feedback controller with provable guarantees. We present a systematic way to construct Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF) to stabilize the microgrid, and, independently, Control Barrier Functions (CBF) to enforce its safe operation at all times. The safety-critical controller (SCC) proposed in this work integrates the two control objectives, with safety prioritized, into a quadratic program (QP) as linear constraints, which allows for its online deployment using off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers. The SCC is compared against a robust version of the conventional droop control through numerical experiments whose results indicate the SCC outperforms the droop controller in guaranteeing safety and retaining stability at the same time.</p>

            <p>Traditional optimization-based techniques for time-synchronized state estimation (SE) often suffer from high online computational burden, limited phasor measurement unit (PMU) coverage, and presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. Although conventional learning-based models have been developed to overcome these challenges, they are negatively impacted by topology changes and real-time data loss. This paper proposes a novel deep geometric learning approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate the states of PMU-unobservable power systems. The proposed approach combines graph convolution and multi-head graph attention layers inside a customized end-to-end learning framework to handle topology changes and real-time data loss. An upper bound on SE error as a function of topology change is also derived. Experimental results for different test systems demonstrate superiority of the proposed customized GNN-SE (CGNN-SE) over traditional optimization-based techniques as well as conventional learning-based models in presence of topology changes, PMU failures, bad data, non-Gaussian measurement noise, and large system implementation.</p>

            <p>The rapid growth of EVs and the subsequent increase in charging demand pose significant challenges for load grid scheduling and the operation of EV charging stations. Effectively harnessing the spatiotemporal correlations among EV charging stations to improve forecasting accuracy is complex. To tackle these challenges, we propose EV-LLM for EV charging loads based on LLMs in this paper. EV-LLM integrates the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in spatiotemporal feature extraction with the generalization capabilities of fine-tuned generative LLMs. Also, EV-LLM enables effective data mining and feature extraction across multimodal and multidimensional datasets, incorporating historical charging data, weather information, and relevant textual descriptions to enhance forecasting accuracy for multiple charging stations. We validate the effectiveness of EV-LLM by using charging data from 10 stations in California, demonstrating its superiority over the other traditional deep learning methods and potential to optimize load grid scheduling and support vehicle-to-grid interactions.</p>

            <p>The optimal transmission switching problem (OTSP) is an established problem of changing a power grid's topology to obtain an improved operation by controlling the switching status of transmission lines. This problem was proven to be NP-hard. Proposed solution techniques based on mixed-integer formulations can guarantee globally optimal solutions but are potentially intractable in realistic power grids. Heuristics methods cannot guarantee global optimality but can provide tractable solution approaches. This paper proposes solving the OTSP using exact formulations alongside parallel heuristics that generate good candidate solutions to speed up conventional branch-and-bound algorithms. The innovative aspect of this work is a new asynchronous parallel algorithmic architecture. A solver instance solving the full OTSP formulation is run in parallel to another process that asynchronously generates solutions to be injected into the full OTSP solution procedure during run time. Our method is tested on 14 instances of the pglib-opf library: The largest problem consisting of 13659 buses and 20467 branches. Our results show a good performance for large problem instances, with consistent improvements over off-the-shelf solver performance. We find that the method scales well with an increase in parallel processors.</p>

            <p>We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</p>

            <p>Local electricity markets offer a promising solution for integrating renewable energy sources and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks. These markets enable the effective utilization of flexible resources by facilitating coordination among various agents. Beyond technical and economic considerations, addressing social equity within these local communities is critical and requires dedicated attention in market-clearing frameworks. This paper proposes a social equity-based market-clearing framework for the optimal management of DERs' energy and flexibility within local communities. The proposed framework incorporates consumers' energy burden to ensure fair pricing in energy market clearance. Furthermore, to ensure equity during unbalanced operating conditions, flexible resources are managed in the local flexibility market, ensuring that all participants can trade power fairly under network disturbances. The model is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) optimization and validated on the IEEE 33-bus test distribution network.</p>

            <h2>Second-Order-Cone Formulations of Power Flow for Topology Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Rhodes, James Luedkte, Line Roald</p>
            <p>Optimization problems that involve topology optimization in scenarios with large scale outages, such as post-disaster restoration or public safety power shutoff planning, are very challenging to solve. Using simple power flow representations such as DC power flow or network flow models results in low quality solutions which requires significantly higher-than-predicted load shed to become AC feasible. Recent work has shown that formulations based on the Second Order Cone (SOC) power flow formulation find very high quality solutions with low load shed, but the computational burden of these formulations remains a significant challenge. With the aim of reducing computational time while maintaining high solution quality, this work explores formulations which replace the conic constraints with a small number of linear cuts. The goal of this approach is not to find an exact power flow solution, but rather to identify good binary decisions, where the power flow can be resolved after the binary variables are fixed. We find that a simple reformulation of the Second Order Cone Optimal Power Shutoff problem can greatly improve the solution speed, but that a full linearization of the SOC voltage cone equation results in an overestimation of the amount of power that can be delivered to loads.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyi Tao, Ran Li, Salvador Pineda</p>
            <p>Time-adaptive unit commitment (UC) has recently been investigated to reduce the scheduling costs by flexibly varying the temporal resolution, which is usually determined by clustering the net load patterns. However, there exists a misalignment between cost and net load patterns due to the discrete start-up costs and out-of-merit-order dispatch triggered by ramping and other constraints. The optimal time-adaptive resolution cannot be completely captured by clustering-based method. This paper proposes a cost-oriented method to address this misalignment by a novel bilevel optimization approach that is efficiently solved through a heuristic greedy algorithm. The impact of varying temporal resolution on the final scheduling costs are tested, based on which the temporal resolution is heuristically updated, achieving significant cost reduction without increasing the number of temporal periods. Subsequently, an improved discretized Adam optimization method together with offline warm start and online refinement strategy is proposed to efficiently search for the better temporal resolution configuration. Results show that the proposed cost-oriented UC temporal resolution determination method achieves enhanced cost efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Probabilistic Net Load Forecasting for High-Penetration RES Grids Utilizing Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixiang Huang, Jianhua Pei, Luocheng Chen, Zhenchang Du, Jinfu Chen, Zirui Peng</p>
            <p>The proliferation of intermittent distributed renewable energy sources (RES) in modern power systems has fundamentally compromised the reliability and accuracy of deterministic net load forecasting. Generative models, particularly diffusion models, demonstrate exceptional potential in uncertainty quantification for scenario forecasting. Nevertheless, their probabilistic predictive capabilities and conditional bootstrapping mechanisms still remain underexplored. In this paper, a day-ahead probabilistic net load forecasting framework is developed by systematically quantifying epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric variability using the feature-informed enhanced conditional diffusion model (ECDM). The ECDM architecture implements the net load distribution generation process using an imputation-based conditional diffusion model, where multi-modal conditional inputs, such as weather and calendar data, are fused via cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, historical net load profiles are utilized to guide the reverse diffusion trajectory through non-parametric imputation operators preserving spatial-temporal integrity. To capture periodic characteristics, a novel weekly arrangement method is also introduced, while an unconditional model is integrated to ensure diversity in the generated scenarios. Subsequently, the maximum probabilistic points and probability intervals of predicted net load are obtained by the adaptive kernel density estimation under RES intermittency. Moreover, ECDM is extented to multi-energy forecast framework, attempting to increase interpretability of the net load predictions. Numerical experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the superior forecasting performance of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p>

            <h2>DFRC Systems Co-existing in Licensed Spectrum: Cognitive Beamforming Designs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tuan Anh Le, Ivan Ku, Xin-She Yang, Christos Masouros, Tho Le-Ngoc</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) system with cognitive radio capability to tackle the spectral scarcity problem in wireless communications. Particularly, a cognitive DFRC system operates on a spectrum owned by a primary system to simultaneously perform data communication and target tracking with the condition that its interference to the primary users (PUs) is below a certain threshold. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly design the beamforming vectors for both the radar and communication functions in such a way that the mean square error (MSE) of the beam pattern between the designed and desired waveforms is minimized. The optimization problem has the following three constraints: i) the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each data communication user is above a predetermined level; ii) the per-antenna transmit power is maintained at a given level; iii) the interference imposed on each PU is below a certain threshold. Both the semidefinite relaxation and nature-inspired firefly algorithms are proposed in order to search for the optimal solutions to the optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that our proposed algorithms can enable the DFRC system to protect the PUs while simultaneously performing its communication and radar functions.</p>

            <h2>Movable Antenna Enhanced Federated Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models via Hybrid Client Selection Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhao, Yue Xiu, Chengxiao Dai, Ning Wei, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Large language model (LLM) training in 6G networks faces stringent latency and energy constraints while operating over bandwidth-limited wireless links. A commonly adopted workflow separates training into a centralized pre-training phase and a federated fine-tuning phase on domain-specific data; however, over-the-air (OTA) gradient aggregation during fine-tuning remains vulnerable to fading and interference. This study explores the integration of movable antennas (MAs), whose element positions can be reconfigured in real time, to mitigate such channel impairments. An auxiliary channel representation embeds transmit power terms in the effective gain, thereby removing explicit power-control variables. We derive the convergence bound that determines the relationship between the final fine-tuning loss to OTA noise and the distribution shift between the two data stages, measured via the Wasserstein distance. These findings lead to a mixed integer, nonconvex resource allocation problem that jointly determines the numbers of global rounds, CPU frequencies, mini-batch sizes, positions of MAs, and beamformers under latency-energy constraints. We propose a hybrid successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm to solve the problem. Experiments with the OpenLLaMA v2 model with 3 billion parameters demonstrate up to $95\%$ faster convergence and over $90\%$ lower total energy consumption relative to the leading wireless federated learning baselines, underscoring the promise of MAs-assisted federated LLM fine-tuning for 6G edge intelligence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Na Xue, Xidong Mu, Yue Chen, Yuanwei Liu</p>
            <p>A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (STARS) assisted near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the radio sensors are installed on the STARS to directly conduct the distance-domain sensing by exploiting the characteristic spherical wavefront. A new squared position error bound (SPEB) expression is derived to reveal the dependence on beamforming (BF) design and sensor deployment. To balance the trade-off between the SPEB and the sensor deployment cost, a cost function minimization problem, a cost function minimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the sensor deployment, the active and passive BF, subject to communication and power consumption constraints. For the sensor deployment optimization, a joint sensor deployment algorithm is proposed by invoking the successive convex approximation. Under a specific relationship between the sensor numbers and BF design, we derive the optimal sensor interval in a closed-form expression. For the joint BF optimization, a penalty-based method is invoked. Simulation results validated that the derived SPEB expression is close to the exact SPEB, which reveals the Fisher information Matrix of position estimation in NF can be approximated as a diagonal matrix. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms achieve the best SPEB performance than the benchmark schemes accompanying the lowest deployment cost.</p>

            <h2>The Impact of Uniform Circular Array on Near-field ISAC</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Na Xue, Xidong Mu, Yue Chen, Yuanwei Liu</p>
            <p>A novel uniform circular array (UCA) based near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed, where the Cylindrical coordinate is invoked to evaluate the joint positioning performance. The joint squared position error bound (SPEB) of the sensing target (ST) is derived for the coplanar and non-coplanar cases. For the coplanar case, where the ST is located in the coplanar region of the UCA, the approximate Cram{é}r-Rao bound (CRB) expressions for the separate angle and distance estimation are given by exploiting the uniform spherical wavefront model. A SPEB minimization problem is formulated with the constraints of communication requirement and power budget, where the closed-form solution to minimize the CRB of the angle is derived. Inspired by the close-form expression, a low complexity vector-based quadratic transformation (VQF) algorithm is proposed by invoking the Rayleigh quotient. For the non-coplanar case, where the ST is located beyond the coplanar region of the UCA, the separate CRBs over three-dimensional coordinates and the joint SPEB approximations are derived. To minimize the SPEB performance, the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and extended low-complexity VQF algorithm are proposed. Numerical results validated that i) the Fisher Information Matrix about angle and distance in NF propagation can be approximated as a diagonal matrix with the trinity loss; ii) Compared with the uniform planar array, the UCA achieve better positioning performance when ST located in the coplanar of the antenna array; and iii) the proposed VQF algorithms reach higher solution precision than conventional SDR algorithm with much less computation complexity.</p>

            <h2>Power-of-Two (PoT) Weights in Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Elgenedy</p>
            <p>Complexity of Neural Networks is increasing rapidly due to the massive increase in model parameters. Specifically, in Large Language Models (LLMs), the number of model parameters has grown exponentially in the past few years, for example, from 1.5 billion parameters in GPT2 to 175 billion in GPT3. This raises a significant challenge for implementation, especially for Edge devices where memory and processing power are very limited. In this work, we investigate reducing LLM complexity with special type of quantization, power of two (PoT), for linear layers weights and transformer tables. PoT not only provides memory reduction but more importantly provides significant computational reduction through converting multiplication to bit shifting. We obtained preliminary results of PoT quantization on Nano-GPT implementation using Shakespeare dataset. We then extended results to 124-M GPT-2 model. The PoT quantization results are shown to be very promising with cross entropy loss degradation $\approx$[1.3-0.88] with number of bits range [4-6] to represent power levels.</p>

            <h2>Single-layer Circular SIW Filtenna With Beam Scanning Capability for 5G Millimeter Wave Communication Applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiawang Li</p>
            <p>In this communication, two novel low-cost single-layer filtering antennas (filtennas) are proposed for millimeter wave (mmWave) applications. The proposed filtennas consists of a compact circular substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity, a metal post close to the center of the cavity for power feeding, a metal post in the center for modes controlling, and a slot for radiating power. In the passband, the fundamental TM010 mode and the TM110 mode in the circular SIW cavity are excited by the feeding post. In addition, thanks to the high-pass characteristics of the cavity, it exhibits more than 20 dB suppression in the lower frequency band. There are three radiation nulls in Filtenna 1 and one radiation null in Filtenna 2 in the upper band which increase the suppression level as high as 18 dB. As a proof of concept, the proposed filtennas are fabricated and measured. It is shown that the Filtenna 1 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB impedance fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 7.1% (27.14 - 29.13 GHz) and 8.6% (27.62 - 30.11 GHz), respectively. While filtenna 2 can achieve simulated and measured -10 dB FBW of 7.4% (27.86 - 29.99 GHz) and 10.1% (28.11 - 31.09 GHz), respectively. The filtennas features stable radiation patterns with an average gain of 5.0 dBi. The lower and upper sideband suppression levels for both filtennas exceed 18 dB. These filtennas are good candidates for 5G mmWave applications, as they simultaneously provide beam scanning and filtering capability with a low cost, and single layer structure.</p>

            <h2>Neural Network-based Information-Theoretic Transceivers for High-Order Modulation Schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngoc Long Pham, Tri Nhu Do</p>
            <p>Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence (Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate. Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.</p>

            <h2>Physics-based Generative Models for Geometrically Consistent and Interpretable Wireless Channel Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyavrat Wagle, Akshay Malhotra, Shahab Hamidi-Rad, Aditya Sant, David J.Love, Christopher G. Brinton</p>
            <p>In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource-intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario being generated. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating established parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PPGC) modeling frameworks with generative methods to produce realistic channel matrices with interpretable representations in the parameter domain. We show that generative models converge to prohibitively suboptimal stationary points when learning the underlying prior directly over the parameters due to the non-convex PPGC model. To address this limitation, we propose a linearized reformulation of the problem to ensure smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also providing insights into the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated, scenario-specific samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through its utility when used for downstream compression tasks.</p>

            <h2>The Coupling Effect of Sensing Targets on the Environment for 3GPP ISAC Channels: Observation, Modeling, and Validation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yameng Liu, Jianhua Zhang, Yuxiang Zhang, Hongbo Xing, Yifeng Xiong, Zhiqiang Yuan, Guangyi Liu</p>
            <p>Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) has been identified as a key 6G application by ITU and 3GPP, with standardization efforts already underway. Sensing tasks, such as target localization, demand more precise characterization of the sensing target (ST) in ISAC channel modeling. The ST couples complexly with environmental scatterers, potentially blocking some multipaths and generating new ones, resulting in power variations compared to the original channel. To accurately model this effect, this paper proposes a coupled ISAC channel model based on measurements and validates it through similarity analysis between simulated and measured channels. In this work, we first conduct ISAC channel measurements in an indoor factory scenario at 105 GHz, where the multipath power variations caused by the ST's interaction with the environment are clearly observed. Then, we propose an ISAC channel modeling framework that incorporates two novel parameters: the Blockage-Region Coupling Factor (BR-CF) and the Forward-Scattering (FS)-CF, which characterize the spatial region and intensity of the coupling effect, respectively. Finally, the proposed model is validated through similarity comparison with measured data, demonstrating higher accuracy for both LoS and NLoS scenarios compared to the non-coupled model. This realistic ISAC channel model provides an effective framework for capturing the ST-environment coupling effect, supporting the design and evaluation of ISAC technologies.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel framework for integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (ISCSC) within vehicular networks comprising a roadside unit (RSU) and multiple autonomous vehicles. Both the RSU and the vehicles are equipped with local knowledge bases to facilitate semantic communication. The framework incorporates a secure communication design to ensure that messages intended for specific vehicles are protected against interception. In this model, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed by the RSU to accurately track all vehicles. We formulate a joint optimization problem that balances maximizing the probabilistically constrained semantic secrecy rate for each vehicle while minimizing the sum of the posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB), subject to the RSU's computing capabilities. This non-convex optimization problem is addressed using Bernstein-type inequality (BTI) and alternating optimization (AO) techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its advantages in reliable sensing, high data throughput, and secure communication.</p>

            <h2>Near-Field Multiuser Localization Based on Extremely Large Antenna Array with Limited RF Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyu Teng, Xiaojun Yuan, Rui Wang, Ying-Chang Liang</p>
            <p>Extremely large antenna array (ELAA) not only effectively enhances system communication performance but also improves the sensing capabilities of communication systems, making it one of the key enabling technologies in 6G wireless networks. This paper investigates the multiuser localization problem in an uplink Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with an ELAA to receive signals from multiple single-antenna users. We exploit analog beamforming to reduce the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. We first develop a comprehensive near-field ELAA channel model that accounts for the antenna radiation pattern and free space path loss. Due to the large aperture of the ELAA, the angular resolution of the array is high, which improves user localization accuracy. However, it also makes the user localization problem highly non-convex, posing significant challenges when the number of RF chains is limited. To address this issue, we use an array partitioning strategy to divide the ELAA channel into multiple subarray channels and utilize the geometric constraints between user locations and subarrays for probabilistic modeling. To fully exploit these geometric constraints, we propose the array partitioning-based location estimation with limited measurements (APLE-LM) algorithm based on the message passing principle to achieve multiuser localization. We derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) as the theoretical performance lower bound for our formulated near-field multiuser localization problem. Extensive simulations under various parameter configurations validate the proposed APLE-LM algorithm. The results demonstrate that APLE-LM achieves superior localization accuracy compared to baseline algorithms and approaches the BCRB at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</p>

            <p>This letter proposes an Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL)-based energy management method for a smart home, which incorporates an implicit thermal dynamics model. In the proposed method, historical optimal decisions are first generated using a neural network-assisted Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (HMPC) framework. These decisions are then used as expert demonstrations in the AIRL module, which aims to train a discriminator to distinguish expert demonstrations from transitions generated by a reinforcement learning agent policy, while simultaneously updating the agent policy that can produce transitions to confuse the discriminator. The proposed HMPC-AIRL method eliminates the need for explicit thermal dynamics models, prior or predictive knowledge of uncertain parameters, or manually designed reward functions. Simulation results based on real-world traces demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaochun Ge, Wenqian Shen, Chengwen Xing, Lian Zhao, Jianping An</p>
            <p>Training beam design for channel estimation with infinite-resolution and low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) in hybrid analog-digital milimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is considered in this paper. By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave channels, the optimization of the sensing matrices (corresponding to training beams) is formulated according to the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Under the condition of infinite-resolution PSs, we propose relevant algorithms to construct the sensing matrix, where the theory of convex optimization and the gradient descent in Riemannian manifold is used to design the digital and analog part, respectively. Furthermore, a block-wise alternating hybrid analog-digital algorithm is proposed to tackle the design of training beams with low-resolution PSs, where the performance degeneration caused by non-convex constant modulus and discrete phase constraints is effectively compensated to some extent thanks to the iterations among blocks. Finally, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based estimator is adopted for achieving an effective recovery of the sparse mmWave channel. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of proposed algorithms compared with some existing schemes.</p>

            <p>Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-based robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) enables enhanced robustness against model uncertainties, such as steering vector mismatches and interference-plus-noise covariance matrix estimation errors. Existing DRO-based RAB methods primarily rely on uncertainty sets characterized by the first- and second-order moments. In this work, we propose a novel Wasserstein DRO-based beamformer, using the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization formulation. The proposed method leverages the Wasserstein metric to define uncertainty sets, offering a data-driven characterization of uncertainty. We show that the choice of the Wasserstein cost function plays a crucial role in shaping the resulting formulation, with norm-based and Mahalanobis-like quadratic costs recovering classical norm-constrained and ellipsoidal robust beamforming models, respectively. This insight highlights the Wasserstein DRO framework as a unifying approach, bridging deterministic and distributionally robust beamforming methodologies.</p>

            <p>Planning and scheduling activities in the electrical power system, such as the commitment of reserve generation, often involve statistical characterization of peak demand. Extreme Value Analysis (EVA)-based probabilistic assessments of annual peaks are widely adopted by energy regulatory and oversight agencies to determine the likelihood and severity of potential energy shortfalls. Due to the inability of classical EVA to account for peak distributions that change with annual extreme temperatures, popular existing approaches apply EVA on simulated annual peaks created by weather-dependent surrogate models using Monté-Carlo simulations on a per-scenario basis. In higher time resolutions such as day-ahead scheduling, the daily peak demand changes upon various factors besides temperature, Monté-Carlo experiments become intractable, and EVA-based modeling manifests as a methodological vacuum. This article explores uncharted territories and pioneers an unparalleled nonstationary EVA estimator that predicts the probable peaks of high-resolution time intervals and their corresponding conditional probability densities based on calendar information and weather conditions where historical peaks are observed. We present a case study on the determination of day-ahead scheduling capacity and demonstrate that compared to the industry approach, our approach results in a $38\%$ reduction in the yearly total committed capacity while maintaining the given risk requirement.</p>
