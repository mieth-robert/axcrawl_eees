            <h2>Mean-Field Learning for Storage Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingguan Liu, Cong Chen, Xiaomeng Ai, Jiakun Fang, Jinsong Wang, Jinyu Wen</p>
            <p>Distributed energy storage devices can be pooled and coordinated by aggregators to participate in power system operations and market clearings. This requires representing a massive device population as a single, tractable surrogate that is computationally efficient, accurate, and compatible with market participation requirements. However, surrogate identification is challenging due to heterogeneity, nonconvexity, and high dimensionality of storage devices. To address these challenges, this paper develops a mean-field learning framework for storage aggregation. We interpret aggregation as the average behavior of a large storage population and show that, as the population grows, aggregate performance converges to a unique, convex mean-field limit, enabling tractable population-level modeling. This convexity further yields a price-responsive characterization of aggregate storage behavior and allows us to bound the mean-field approximation error. Leveraging these results, we construct a convex surrogate model that approximates the aggregate behavior of large storage populations and can be embedded directly into power system operations and market clearing. Surrogate parameter identification is formulated as an optimization problem using historical market price-response data, and we adopt a gradient-based algorithm for efficient learning procedure. Case studies validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in approximation accuracy, data efficiency, and profit outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Resilient Grid Hardening against Multiple Hazards: An Adaptive Two-Stage Stochastic Optimization Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sifat Chowdhury, Yihsu Chen, Yu Zhang</p>
            <p>The growing prevalence of extreme weather events driven by climate change poses significant challenges to power system resilience. Infrastructure damage and prolonged power outages highlight the urgent need for effective grid-hardening strategies. While some measures provide long-term protection against specific hazards, they can become counterproductive under conflicting threats. In this work, we develop an adaptive two-stage stochastic optimization framework to support dynamic decision-making for hardening critical grid components under multiple hazard exposures. Unlike traditional approaches, our model adapts to evolving climate conditions, enabling more resilient investment strategies. Furthermore, we integrate long-term (undergrounding) and short-term (vegetation management) hardening actions to jointly minimize total system costs. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing outage and repair costs while enhancing the adaptability and robustness of grid infrastructure planning.</p>

            <h2>Surrogate model of a HVAC system for PV self-consumption maximisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. da Costa Paulo, N. Aginako, J. Ugartemendia, I. Landa del Barrio, M. Quartulli, H. Camblong</p>
            <p>In the last few years, energy efficiency has become a challenge. Not only mitigating environmental impact but reducing energy waste can lead to financial advantages. Buildings play an important role in this: they are among the biggest consumers. So, finding manners to reduce energy consumption is a way to minimise energy waste, and a technique for that is creating Demand Response (DR) strategies. This paper proposes a novel way to decrease computational effort of simulating the behaviour of a building using surrogate models based on active learning. Before going straight to the problem of a building, which is complex and computationally costly, the paper proposes the approach of active learning to a smaller problem: with reduced simulations, regress the curve of voltage versus current of a thermo-resistor. Then, the paper implements a surrogate model of energy consumption of a building. The goal is to be able to learn the consumption pattern based on a limited number of simulations. The result given by the surrogate can be used to set the reference temperature, maximising the PV self-consumption, and reducing energy usage from the grid. Thanks to the surrogate, the total time spent to map all possible consumption scenarios is reduced around 7 times.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Analysis Approach for Oscillation Damping in Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Heterogeneous Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Zhu, Xiuqiang He, Hongyang Qing, Hua Geng</p>
            <p>This letter proposes a decentralized local gain condition (LGC) to guarantee oscillation damping in inverter-based resource (IBR)-dominated power systems. The LGC constrains the dynamic gain between each IBR and the network at its point of connection. By satisfying the LGC locally, the closed-loop poles are confined to a desired region, thereby yielding system-wide oscillation damping without requiring global information. Notably, the LGC is agnostic to different IBR dynamics, well-suited for systems with heterogeneous IBRs, and flexible to various damping requirements. Moreover, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to parameterize LGC, providing scalable and damping-constrained parameter tuning guidance for IBRs.</p>

            <h2>A Thermal-Electrical Co-Optimization Framework for Active Distribution Grids with Electric Vehicles and Heat Pumps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Savvas Panagi, Chrysovalantis Spanias, Petros Aristidou</p>
            <p>The growing electrification of transportation and heating through Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Heat Pumps (HPs) introduces both flexibility and complexity to Active Distribution Networks (ADNs). These resources provide substantial operational flexibility but also create tightly coupled thermal-electrical dynamics that challenge conventional network management. This paper proposes a unified co-optimization framework that integrates a calibrated 3R2C grey-box building thermal model into a network-constrained Optimal Power Flow (OPF). The framework jointly optimizes EVs, HPs, and photovoltaic systems while explicitly enforcing thermal comfort, Distributed Energy Resource (DER) limits, and full power flow physics. To maintain computational tractability, Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) relaxations are evaluated on a realistic low-voltage feeder. The analysis shows that, despite network heterogeneity violating some theoretical exactness conditions, the relaxation remains exact in practice. Comparative assessments of convex DistFlow, bus injection, and branch flow formulations reveal that convex DistFlow achieves sub-second runtimes and near-optimal performance even at high DER penetration levels. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of coordinated scheduling, yielding reductions of 41% in transformer aging, 54% in losses, and complete elimination of voltage violations, demonstrating the value of integrated thermal-electrical coordination in future smart grids.</p>

            <h2>A Gradient-Based Capacity Accreditation Framework in Resource Adequacy: Formulation, Computation, and Practical Implications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zhang, Feng Zhao, Gord Stephen, Chanan Singh, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Probabilistic resource adequacy assessment is a cornerstone of modern capacity accreditation. This paper develops a gradient-based framework, in which capacity accreditation is interpreted as the directional derivative of a probabilistic resource adequacy metric with respect to resource capacity, that unifies two widely used accreditation approaches: Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) and Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI). Under mild regularity conditions, we show that marginal ELCC and MRI yield equivalent accreditation factors, while their numerical implementations exhibit markedly different computational characteristics. Building on this framework, we demonstrate how infinitesimal perturbation analysis enables up to a $1000\times$ speedup in gradient estimation for capacity accreditation, and we implement gradient-informed search algorithms that significantly accelerate ELCC computations relative to standard bisection methods. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments show that MRI achieves substantial runtime reductions compared to ELCC and exhibits greater robustness to perturbation step-size selection. These results provide practical guidance for implementing efficient and scalable capacity accreditation in large-scale power systems.</p>

            <h2>Reformulating Energy Storage Capacity Accreditation Problem with Marginal Reliability Impact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qian Zhang, Feng Zhao, Tongxin Zheng, Le Xie</p>
            <p>To enhance the efficiency of capacity markets, many electricity markets in the U.S. are adopting or planning to implement marginal capacity accreditation reforms. This paper provides new insights into energy storage capacity accreditation using Marginal Reliability Impact (MRI). We reformulate the commonly used reliability-based storage dispatch model as an optimization problem, enabling direct calculation of the MRI from the Lagrange multipliers, rather than using brute-force perturbation analysis. The analysis demonstrates that the EUE is a piecewise linear function and the storage MRI retains a non-negative property across various system scenarios. We further explore the influence of qualified capacity (QC), storage dispatch rules, and other key factors on storage accreditation, providing practical insights for system operators. Additionally, comparisons of storage capacity accreditation under different reliability criteria offer valuable guidance for policymakers in setting future standards. Numerical results from a modified California system validate our findings and highlight several important phenomena associated with the MRI-based accreditation scheme.</p>

            <h2>Volt/VAR Optimization in Transmission Networks with Discrete-Control Devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuaicheng Tong, Michael A. Boateng, Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>Voltage (Volt) and reactive-power (VAR) control in transmission networks is critical for reliability and increasingly needs fast, implementable decisions. This paper presents a transmission Volt/VAR Optimization (VVO) framework that co-optimizes discrete control of on-load tap-changing transformers (OLTCs) and capacitor banks (CBs) with AC power flow (ACPF) physics to improve voltage stability and minimize VAR generation. The framework follows a relax-round-resolve pipeline: a continuous relaxation proposes targets, a rounding step selects feasible discrete settings, and a final solve enforces AC power flow physics. Extensive experiments on IEEE, PEGASE, and RTE systems show consistent improvements in voltage and VAR quality metrics with modest generator redispatch while preserving economic operation and achieving compatible runtimes with real-time transmission operations.</p>

            <h2>Multi-threshold time series analysis enables characterization of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Kittel, Wolf-Peter Schill</p>
            <p>Variable renewable energy droughts, so called Dunkelflaute events, emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Next-Generation Grid Codes: Toward a New Paradigm for Dynamic Ancillary Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Kehao Zhuang, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Gabriela Hug, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>OptAgent: an Agentic AI framework for Intelligent Building Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Jiang, Weili Xu, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>The urgent need for building decarbonization calls for a paradigm shift in future autonomous building energy operation, from human-intensive engineering workflows toward intelligent agents that interact with physics-grounded digital environments. This study proposes an end-to-end agentic AI-enabled Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) environment for scalable building energy modeling, simulation, control, and automation. The framework consists of (1) a modular and physics-consistent PIML digital environment spanning building thermal dynamics, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and distributed energy resources (DER) for grid-interactive energy management; and (2) an agentic AI layer with 11 specialist agents and 72 Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that enable end-to-end execution of multi-step energy analytics. A representative case study demonstrates multi-domain, multi-agent coordination for assessing how system and control upgrades affect energy use, operating cost, thermal comfort, and flexibility. In addition, a large-scale benchmark (about 4000 runs) systematically evaluates workflow performance in terms of accuracy, token consumption, execution time, and inference cost. The results quantify the impacts of intelligence mode design, model size, task complexity, and orchestrator-specialist coordination, and provide key lessons for building future agentic AI systems in real-world building energy applications. This work establishes a scalable, physics-grounded foundation for deploying agentic AI in decarbonized and grid-interactive building operations.</p>

            <h2>Coverage Performance Analysis of FAS-enhanced LoRa Wide Area Networks under both Co-SF and Inter-SF Interference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaoze Mu, Yanzhao Hou, Mingjie Chen, Yuanyu Hu, Yongan Zheng, Qimei Cui, Xiaofeng Tao</p>
            <p>This paper presents an analytical framework for evaluating the coverage performance of the fluid antenna system (FAS)-enhanced LoRa wide-area networks (LoRaWANs). We investigate the effects of large-scale pathloss in LoRaWAN, small-scale fading characterized by FAS, and dense interference (i.e., collision in an ALOHA-based mechanism) arising from randomly deployed end devices (EDs). Both co-spreading factor (co-SF) interference (with the same SF) and inter-SF interference (with different SFs) are introduced into the network, and their differences in physical characteristics are also considered in the analysis. Additionally, simple yet accurate statistical approximations of the FAS channel envelope and power are derived using the extreme-value theorem. Based on the approximated channel expression, the theoretical coverage probability of the proposed FAS-enhanced LoRaWAN is derived. Numerical results validate our analytical approximations by exhibiting close agreement with the exact correlation model. Notably, it is revealed that a FAS with a normalized aperture of 1 times 1 can greatly enhance network performance, in terms of both ED numbers and coverage range.</p>

            <h2>C-AoEI-Aware Cross-Layer Optimization in Satellite IoT Systems: Balancing Data Freshness and Transmission Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhua Zhao, Tiejun Lv, Ke Wang</p>
            <p>Satellite-based Internet of Things (S-IoT) faces a fundamental trilemma: propagation delay, dynamic fading, and bandwidth scarcity. While Layer-coded Hybrid ARQ (L-HARQ) enhances reliability, its backtracking decoding introduces age ambiguity, undermining the standard Age of Information (AoI) metric and obscuring the critical trade-off between data freshness and transmission efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel cross-layer optimization framework centered on a new metric, the Cross-layer Age of Error Information (C-AoEI). We derive a closed-form expression for C-AoEI, explicitly linking freshness to system parameters, establishing an explicit analytical connection between freshness degradation and channel dynamics. Building on this, we develop a packet-level encoded L-HARQ scheme for multi-GBS scenarios and an adaptive algorithm that jointly optimizes coding and decision thresholds. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework: it achieves 31.8% higher transmission efficiency and 17.2% lower C-AoEI than conventional schemes. The framework also proves robust against inter-cell interference and varying channel conditions, providing a foundation for designing efficient, latency-aware next-generation S-IoT protocols.</p>

            <p>We investigate precoding for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) joint communications and sensing (JCAS) systems, taking into account the potential interference between sensing and communication channels. We derive indicators for the sensing and communication performance, i.e., the detection probability and the communication signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) for general input signals. Our results show that the use of the communication signal for sensing can prevent a loss in communication performance if channel interference occurs, while the kurtosis of the transmit alphabet of the communication signal limits the sensing performance.

            <p>In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) deployment scheme of pinching antenna array is proposed, aiming to enhances the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. To fully realize the potential of 3D deployment, a joint antenna positioning, time allocation and transmit power optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum communication rate with the constraints of target sensing rates and system energy. To solve the sum rate maximization problem, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network based reinforcement learning (HGRL) algorithm. Simulation results prove that 3D deployment of pinching antenna array outperforms 1D and 2D counterparts in ISAC systems. Moreover, the proposed HGRL algorithm surpasses other baselines in both performance and convergence speed due to the advanced observation construction of the environment.</p>

            <p>In this paper, a general ISAC system where the base station (BS) communicates with multiple users and performs target detection is considered. Then, a sum communication rate maximization problem is formulated, subjected to the constraints of transmit power and the minimum sensing rates of users. To solve this problem, we develop a framework that leverages deep learning algorithms to provide a three-stage solution for ISAC beamforming. The three-stage beamforming optimization solution includes three modules: 1) an unsupervised learning based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to extract fixed-size latent features while keeping its essential information from the variable channel state information (CSI); 2) a reinforcement learning (RL) based beampattern optimization algorithm is proposed to search the desired beampattern according to the extracted features; 3) a supervised learning based beamforming reconstruction algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the beamforming vector from beampattern given by the RL agent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed three-stage solution outperforms the baseline RL algorithm by optimizing the intuitional beampattern rather than beamforming.</p>

            <p>The efficient user scheduling policy in the massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) system remains a significant challenge in the field of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) due to its high computational complexity, scalability, and Channel State Information (CSI) overhead.

The QRL agent can explore the exponentially large scheduling space effectively by applying Grover's search to the reinforcement learning process. The model is implemented using our designed quantum-gate-based circuit, which imitates the layered architecture of reinforcement learning, where quantum operations act as policy updates and decision-making units. Moreover, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves proper convergence and significantly outperforms classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Quantum Deep Learning (QDL) benchmarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Gutierrez, Redouane Silvente</p>
            <p>We present two machine learning frameworks for forecasting aggregated curves and optimizing storage in the EPEX SPOT day-ahead market. First, a fast parametric model forecasts hourly demand and supply curves in a low-dimensional and grid-robust representation, with minimum and maximum volumes combined with a Chebyshev polynomial for the elastic segment. The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability. Second, for a more comprehensive analysis, though less suited to daily operation, we employ generative models that learn the joint distribution of 24-hour order-level submissions given weather and fuel variables. These models generate synthetic daily scenarios of individual buy and sell orders, which, once aggregated, yield hourly supply and demand curves. Based on these forecasts, we optimize a price-making storage strategy, quantify revenue distributions, and highlight the price-compression effect with lower peaks, higher off-peak levels, and diminishing returns as capacity expands.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Rate-Splitting and Sparse Code Multiple Access (RS-SCMA): Design and Performance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minerva Priyadarsini, Zilong Liu, Kuntal Deka, Sujit Kumar Sahoo, Sanjeev Sharma</p>
            <p>This paper proposes, for the first time, a hybrid multiple access framework that integrates the principles of rate-splitting (RS) and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) in an SISO downlink scenario. The proposed scheme, termed RS-SCMA, unifies the powerful interference management capability of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with the near-optimal multiuser detection of SCMA. A key feature of RS-SCMA is a tunable splitting factor $\alpha$, which governs the allocation between the generic $M$-ary modulated common messages and SCMA-encoded private messages. This enables dynamic control over the fundamental trade-off between system sum-rate, bit error rate (BER), and the overloading factor. We develop novel transmitter and receiver architectures based on soft successive interference cancellation (SIC), incorporating message passing algorithm (MPA) detection and soft-symbol reconstruction. Furthermore, a unified analytical expression for the achievable sum-rate is derived as a function of the splitting factor $\alpha$. The performance of the proposed RS-SCMA system is evaluated in terms of both BER and sum-rate. Simulation results confirm the superiority of RS-SCMA over conventional SCMA and multi-carrier RSMA, demonstrating its scalability and robustness even in the presence of channel estimation errors.</p>

            <h2>Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Andersson, Anubhab Chowdhury, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals. To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization. Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.</p>

            <h2>Spatiotemporal Semantic V2X Framework for Cooperative Collision Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Aisha Syed, Matthew Andrews, Sean Kennedy</p>
            <p>Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) demand real-time collision prediction to ensure road safety and reduce accident severity. Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints. In this work, we propose a semantic V2X framework in which RSU-mounted cameras generate spatiotemporal semantic embeddings of future frames using the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA). To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS.</p>

            <h2>Improving Stability Margins with Grid-Forming Damper Winding Emulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dahlia Saba, Dominic Groß</p>
            <p>This work presents (i) a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a power system with line dynamics and heterogeneous bus dynamics, (ii) a novel reduced-order model of damper windings in synchronous machines, and (iii) a proportional-derivative (PD) damper winding emulation control for voltage-source converters (VSCs). Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation.</p>

            <h2>Dual Analysis of Continuous-time Economic Dispatch and Its Price Implications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Menghan Zhang, Caisheng Wang</p>
            <p>As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven Predictive Control for Wide-Area Power Oscillation Damping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Mastroddi, Jan Poland, Mats Larsson, Keith Moffat</p>
            <p>We study damping of inter-area oscillations in transmission grids using voltage-source-converter-based high-voltage direct-current (VSC-HVDC) links. Conventional power oscillation damping controllers rely on system models that are difficult to obtain in practice. Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) addresses this limitation by replacing explicit models with data. We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.</p>

            <h2>DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>\textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib, available at \href{this https URL}{GitHub}, fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting Z Transform Laplace Inversion: To Correct flaws in Signal and System Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Chaojie Li, Xin Li, Yingyi Yan, Mingyang Zheng</p>
            <p>This paper revisits the classical formulation of the Z-transform and its relationship to the inverse Laplace transform (L-1), originally developed by Ragazzini in sampled-data theory. It identifies a longstanding mathematical oversight in standard derivations, which typically neglect the contribution from the infinite arc in the complex plane during inverse Laplace evaluation. This omission leads to inconsistencies, especially at discontinuities such as t = 0. By incorporating the full Bromwich contour, including all boundary contributions, we restore internal consistency between L-1 and the Z-transform, aligning the corrected L-1 with results from Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) aliasing theory. Consequently, this necessitates a structural revision of the Z-transform, inverse Laplace transform, and the behavior of the Heaviside step function at discontinuities, providing a more accurate foundation for modeling and analysis of sampled-data systems.</p>

            <h2>Data-Efficient Physics-Informed Learning to Model Synchro-Waveform Dynamics of Grid-Integrated Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivanshu Tripathi, Hossein Mohsenzadeh Yazdi, Maziar Raissi, Hamed Mohsenian-Rad</p>
            <p>Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.</p>

We formulate this task as an online resource allocation problem. We propose an algorithm, based on online mirror descent, that is no-regret in the stochastic i.i.d. setting and attains finite asymptotic competitive ratio in the adversarial setting (robustness). When untrusted advice about the opportunity cost of degradation is available, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm that performs well when the advice is accurate (consistency) while still retaining robustness properties when the advice is poor.</p>

            <p>This research study analyses different types of photovoltaic (PV) energy sharing in a collective self-consumption (CSC) real-case in the Izarbel technological park in France. The analysis is carried out above all from the point of view of the self-consumption rate (SCR) and the savings. After explaining the emergence of the self-consumption concept for the integration of renewable energies, the study case is described. The PV energy is produced in ESTIA1 building and consumed in ESTIA1, 2 and 4 buildings. The main IoT components used to implement the CSC are smart meters and the Tecsol TICs; devices based on the LoRa protocol to retrieve production and consumption data. Then, the characteristics of PV energy sharing in France are explained, in particular the three possible types of energy sharing/allocation (static, dynamic by default and customised dynamic) and the structure of the electricity bill. Finally, the three types of sharing are compared in four scenarios (without and with a data centre, for low and high solar radiation). The results show that the dynamic allocations lead to increases of the SCR and that the customised dynamic sharing increases savings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucu M., Martinez-Laserna E., Gandiaga I., Liu K., Camblong H., Widanage W.D., Marco J</p>
            <p>Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing. In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model. This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.</p>

            <h2>A Cherry-Picking Approach to Large Load Shaping for More Effective Carbon Reduction</h2>

            <p>Shaping multi-megawatt loads, such as data centers, impacts generator dispatch on the electric grid, which in turn affects system CO2 emissions and energy cost. Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that "cherry-picks" a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data. The cherry-picking approach to power load shaping is applicable to any large flexible consumer on the electricity grid, such as data centers, distributed energy resources and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).</p>

            <h2>Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Aditya Rangarajan, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper analyzes a method to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing by introducing consumer-based carbon costs and a carbon allocation mechanism. Specifically, consumers submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. The carbon allocation mechanism then assigns emissions from generation to consumers to minimize overall carbon costs. Our analysis starts from a previously proposed centralized market clearing formulation that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility, and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation that incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and demand reductions.</p>

            <p>Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.</p>

            <p>Modern buildings are increasingly interconnected with occupancy, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, distributed energy resources (DERs), and power grids. Modeling, control, and optimization of such multi-domain systems play a critical role in achieving building-sector decarbonization. However, most existing tools lack scalability and physical consistency for addressing these complex, multi-scale ecosystem problems. To bridge this gap, this study presents BESTOpt, a modular, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework that unifies building applications, including benchmarking, evaluation, diagnostics, control, optimization, and performance simulation. The framework adopts a cluster-domain-system/building-component hierarchy and a standardized state-action-disturbance-observation data typology. By embedding physics priors into data-driven modules, BESTOpt improves model accuracy and physical consistency under unseen conditions. Case studies on single-building and cluster scenarios demonstrate its capability for multi-level centralized and decentralized control. Looking ahead, BESTOpt lays the foundation for an open, extensible platform that accelerates interdisciplinary research toward smart, resilient, and decarbonized building ecosystems.</p>

            <p>Data centers are growing rapidly, creating the pressing need for the development of critical infrastructure build out to support these resource-intensive large loads. Their immense consumption of electricity and, often, freshwater, continues to stress an already constrained and aging power grid and water resources. This paper presents a comprehensive modeling approach to determine the optimal locations to construct such facilities by quantifying their resource use and minimizing associated costs. The interdisciplinary modeling approach incorporates a number of factors including the power grid, telecommunications, climate, water use, and collocated generation potential. This work establishes the base model whose functionality is shown through several test cases focusing on carbon-free generation collocation on a county-level in the United States. The results suggest that while capital costs are the biggest driver, having a longer future outlook and allowing more variable generation collocation influences the model to choose sites with higher renewable potential.</p>

The control parameters are designed for decoupling and pole placement. The proposed method exhibits strong robustness in stability and dynamical performance across varying and uncertain grid strengths. The robust control performance of the proposed method is first demonstrated by small-signal analysis, then validated by experiments on a 20 kVA power conversion system.</p>

It presents existing legal and normative requirements and scientific research directions regarding these meters. Selected test results are presented, which show that although the tested meters meet the normative and legal requirements because they have been approved for sale, numerous imperfections in the signal and measurement chains of the analyzed instruments are revealed for the selected test signal. On the basis of the presented research results, further directions of research in the field of smart energy meters have been determined.</p>

Using electromagnetic transient simulations of a representative offshore wind farm modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software, internal and external fault scenarios are assessed, varying fault types and resistances.

            <p>This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowen Ou, Bin Wang, Slava Maslennikov, Hanchao Liu, Jim Follum</p>
            <p>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) convert high-speed waveform data into low-speed phasor data, which are fundamental to wide-area monitoring and control in power systems, with oscillation detection and localization among their most prominent applications. However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Zhengmao Li, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>In low-carbon grids, system flexibility can be enhanced through mechanisms such as Demand Response (DR), enabling the efficient utilization of renewable energy. However, as Synchronous Generators (SGs) are being replaced by renewable energy sources characterized by Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), system stability is severely affected. Due to the limited overload capability of IBRs, their Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of SGs. As a result, protection devices may fail to trip during faults. Consequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in providing sufficient SCC. Since the commitment of SGs is closely related to system loading conditions, DR can indirectly affect their SCC provision, a relationship that has not yet been investigated in the literature. Therefore, this paper incorporates both DR and SCC constraints into a unit commitment problem and conducts case studies on an IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that although DR can reduce total costs by adjusting power demand, it may also lead to inadequate SCC levels. Nevertheless, when flexible loads are properly coordinated with SCC requirements, the total cost increases by only 0.3%, which is significantly lower than the cost of system dispatch without DR. This demonstrates that DR can facilitate stable system operation in a cost-effective manner.</p>

            <h2>All-Pass Fractional OPF: A Solver-Friendly, Physics-Preserving Approximation of AC OPF</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian, Javad Lavaei</p>
            <p>This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{this https URL}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.</p>

            <h2>Calibrated uncertainty quantification for prosumer flexibility aggregation in ancillary service markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar, S. Ali Pourmousavi, Jon A.R. Liisberg, Julian Lesmos-Vinasco</p>
            <p>Reliable forecasting of prosumer flexibility is critical for demand response aggregators participating in frequency controlled ancillary services market, where strict reliability requirements such as the P90 standard are enforced. Limited historical data, dependence on exogeneous factors, and heterogenous prosumer behaviour introduce significant epistemic uncertainty, making deterministic or poorly calibrated probabilistic models unsuitable for market bidding. This paper proposes the use of scalable uncertainty quantification framework that integrates Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) with conformal prediction (CP) to produce calibrated, finite sample prediction intervals for aggregated prosumer flexibility. The proposed framework is applied to a behind-the-meter aggregator participating in the Danish manual frequency restoration reserve capacity market. A large-scale synthetic dataset is generated using a modified industry-grade home energy management system, combined with publicly available load, solar, price, activation and device-level data. The resulting machine learning surrogate model captures aggregate prosumer price responsiveness and provides uncertainty-aware estimates suitable for market bidding. Multiple multivariate CP strategies are evaluated and benchmarked against conventional MCD-based methods. Results show that standalone MCD systematically overestimates available flexibility and violates P90 compliance, whereas the proposed MCD-CP framework achieves reliable coverage with controlled conservatism. When embedded in aggregator bidding model, conformalised methods substantially reduce overbidding risk and achieve upto 70% of perfect-information profit while satisfying regulatory reliability constraints, providing practical, computationally efficient, and market-compliant solution for aggregator flexibility forecasting under uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>A Two-Stage Risk-Averse DRO-MILP Methodological Framework for Managing AI/Data Center Demand Shocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sharaf K. Magableh, Caisheng Wang, Oraib Dawaghreh</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers is reshaping electricity demand patterns. This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads. This contributes a scalable planning tool for resilient, AI-integrated distribution grids.</p>

            <h2>Efficient reformulations of ReLU deep neural networks for surrogate modelling in power system optimisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Pipada Sunil Kumar, S. Ali Pourmousavi, Jon A.R. Liisberg, Julian Lesmos-Vinasco</p>
            <p>The ongoing decarbonisation of power systems is driving an increasing reliance on distributed energy resources, which introduces complex and nonlinear interactions that are difficult to capture in conventional optimisation models. As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.</p>

            <h2>Ramping-aware Enhanced Flexibility Aggregation of Distributed Generation with Energy Storage in Power Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongon Park, Daniel K. Molzahn, Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks are increasingly hosting controllable and flexible distributed energy resources (DERs) that, when aggregated, can provide ancillary support to transmission systems. However, existing aggregation schemes often ignore the ramping constraints of these DERs, which can render them impractical in real deployments. This work proposes a ramping-aware flexibility aggregation scheme, computed at the transmission-distribution boundary, that explicitly accounts for DER ramp limits and yields flexibility envelopes that are provably disaggregable. To further enhance the attainable flexibility region, we introduce a novel pre-ramping strategy, which proactively adjusts resource operating points to enlarge the aggregated flexibility envelope while preserving both network feasibility and disaggregation guarantees. The proposed method demonstrates a 5.2% to 19.2% improvement in flexibility relative to the baseline model, depending on system conditions. We validate the scheme on an IEEE-33 bus distribution system and provide formal proofs showing that both aggregation strategies are disaggregable for all feasible trajectories within the aggregate flexibility envelope.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Design of a Clean Offshore Heat and Power (CleanOFF) Hub</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maiken Borud Omtveit, Qian Long, Valentin Chabaud, Marte Ruud-Olsen, Steinar Halsne, Tor-Christian Ystgaard</p>
            <p>This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil & gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Wald, Amir Sajadi, Barry Mather, Giovanni De Carne</p>
            <p>This paper presents an integration study for a power electronic-based fast-frequency response technology, an asynchronous grid connection operating as an aggregator for behindthe-meter resources and distributed generators. Both technical feasibility and techno-economic viability studies are presented. The dynamic performance of the fast-frequency response enabled by the asynchronous grid connection is validated with Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments and transferred to an IEEE 9-bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for dynamic stability analysis. We demonstrate that droop-based control enhancements to the local distributed generators could allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the market for ancillary services. To this end, we performed a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon. Finally, the techno-economic analysis concludes with recommendations for enhancements to access the full potential of distributed generators on a technical and regulatory level.</p>

            <h2>Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khaled Bin Walid, Feng Ye, Jiaxiang Ji, Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, Travis Miles, Yazhou Leo Jiang</p>
            <p>This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</p>

            <h2>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunki Hong, Jisoo Lee</p>
            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics can mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce an operator-legible evaluation framework -- Under-Prediction Rate (UPR), tail Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$ requirements, and explicit inflation diagnostics (Bias$_{24h}$/OPR) -- to quantify one-sided reliability risk beyond MAPE. Using this framework, we evaluate state space models (Mamba variants) and strong baselines on a weather-aligned California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 regional transmission areas) under a rolling-origin walk-forward backtest. We develop and evaluate thermal-lag-aligned weather fusion strategies for these architectures. Our results demonstrate that standard accuracy metrics are insufficient proxies for operational safety: models with comparable MAPE can imply materially different tail reserve requirements (Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$). We show that explicit weather integration narrows error distributions, reducing the impact of temperature-driven demand spikes. Furthermore, while probabilistic calibration reduces large-error events, it can induce systematic schedule inflation. We introduce Bias/OPR-constrained objectives to enable auditable trade-offs between minimizing tail risk and preventing trivial over-forecasting.</p>

            <h2>Profit Maximization for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kun-Yan Jiang, Wei-Yu Chiu, Yuan-Po Tsai</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly integrated into power grids, offering economic and environmental benefits but introducing challenges due to uncoordinated charging. This study addresses the profit maximization problem for multiple EV charging stations (EVCSs) equipped with energy storage systems (ESS) and renewable energy sources (RES), with the capability for energy trading. We propose a Double Hypernetwork QMIX-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to optimize cooperative energy management under uncertainty in EV demand, renewable generation, and real-time electricity prices. The framework mitigates overestimation bias in value estimation, enables distributed decision-making, and incorporates an internal energy trading mechanism. Numerical experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to standard QMIX, the proposed method achieves approximately 5.3% and 12.7% higher total profit for the two regions, respectively, highlighting its economic and operational efficiency. Additionally, the approach maintains robust performance under varying levels of EV demand uncertainty and renewable energy fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Reachability Guarantees for Energy Arbitrage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomás Tapia, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a unified framework for battery energy arbitrage under uncertain market prices that integrates chance-constrained terminal state-of-charge requirements with online threshold policies. We first cast the multi-interval arbitrage problem as a stochastic dynamic program enhanced by a probabilistic end-of-horizon state-of-charge (SoC) constraint, ensuring with high confidence that the battery terminates within a prescribed energy band. We then apply a $k$-search algorithm to derive explicit charging (buying) and discharging (selling) thresholds with provable worst-case competitive ratio, and compute the corresponding action probabilities over the decision horizon. To compute exact distributions under operational limits, we develop a probability redistribution pruning method and use it to quantify the likelihood of meeting the terminal SoC band. Leveraging the resulting SoC distribution, we estimate the minimum stopping-time required to satisfy the SoC chance constraint. Computational experiments on historical real price data demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially improves the estimation of SoC evolution and supports chance-constraint satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing the Impact of EV Battery Charging on the Distribution Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahil Aziz, Wajid Ali, Khaliqur Rahman</p>
            <p>Many countries are rapidly adopting electric vehicles (EVs) due to their meager running cost and environment-friendly nature. EVs are likely to dominate the internal combustion (IC) engine cars entirely over the next few years. With the rise in popularity of EVs, adverse effects of EV charging loads on the grid system have been observed. Since the distribution system (DS) does not cope with the high overloading capacity, the negative impact of EV charging load on the distribution network (DN) cannot be neglected. A high level of EV penetration with uncoordinated charging is the primary cause of voltage instability, increased peak load demand, and reliability issues of the DN. In this paper, a detailed overview of all the notable impacts of EV charging on voltage profile, power quality, and DS performance is discussed. This work also reviews the different topologies of EV chargers and the issues introduced by power converters on the utility grid. Finally, the strategies for improving the charging of EVs proposed in the literature to consider the random nature of EVs charging, the management of peak loads, and bidirectional power flow are summarized.</p>

            <h2>Multiagent Reinforcement Learning in Enhancing Resilience of Microgrids under Extreme Weather Events</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Wu, Wei-Yu Chiu, Yuan-Po Tsai, Shangyuan Liu, Weiqi Hua</p>
            <p>Grid resilience is crucial in light of power interruptions caused by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Well-designed energy management systems (EMS) have made progress in improving microgrid resilience through the coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs), but still face significant challenges in addressing the uncertainty of load demand caused by extreme weather. The integration of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into EMS design enables optimized microgrid control strategies for coordinating DERs. Building on this, we proposed a cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based EMS framework to provide flexible scalability for microgrids, enhance resilience and reduce operational costs during power outages. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit with a gating mechanism was introduced to extract features from temporal data, which enables the EMS to coordinate DERs more efficiently. Next, the proposed MADRL method incorporating action masking techniques was evaluated in the IEEE 33-Bus system using real-world data on renewable generation and power load. Finally, the numerical results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in reducing operating costs as well as the effectiveness in enhancing microgrid resilience during power interruptions.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Based Cell Association in Nonuniform Renewable Energy-Powered Cellular Networks: Analysis and Optimization of Carbon Efficiency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxi Zhao, Vicente Casares-Giner, Vicent Pla, Luis Guijarro, Iztok Humar, Yi Zhong, Xiaohu Ge</p>
            <p>The increasing global push for carbon reduction highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy into the supply chain of cellular networks. However, due to the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and the uneven load distribution across base stations, the utilization rate of renewable energy remains low. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the trade-off between carbon emissions and downlink throughput in cellular networks, offering insights into optimizing both network performance and sustainability. The renewable energy state of base station batteries and the number of occupied channels are modeled as a quasi-birth-death process. We construct models for the probability of channel blocking, average successful transmission probability for users, downlink throughput, carbon emissions, and carbon efficiency based on stochastic geometry. Based on these analyses, an energy-based cell association scheme is proposed to optimize the carbon efficiency of cellular networks. The results show that, compared to the closest cell association scheme, the energy-based cell association scheme is capable of reducing the carbon emissions of the network by 13.0% and improving the carbon efficiency by 11.3%.</p>

            <h2>Convex Model Predictive Control for Safe Output Consensus of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Wang, Shuyuan Zhang, Lei Wang</p>
            <p>Nonlinear dynamics and safety constraints typically result in a nonlinear programming problem when applying model predictive control to achieve safe output consensus. To avoid the heavy computational burden of solving a nonlinear programming problem directly, this paper proposes a novel Convex Model Predictive Control (CMPC) approach based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) scheme. The core of our method lies in transforming the nonlinear constraints into linear forms: we linearize the system dynamics and convexify the discrete-time high-order control barrier functions using a proposed tangent-line projection method. Consequently, the original problem is reduced to a quadratic program that can be iteratively solved within the SQP scheme at each time step of CMPC. Furthermore, we provide the formal guarantee of the convergence of the SQP scheme, and subsequently guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of CMPC. Simulations on multi-agent systems with unicycle dynamics demonstrate a 35-52 times reduction in computation time compared with baseline methods, confirming the suitability of the proposed approach for real-time safe output consensus control.</p>

            <p>Power system outages expose market participants to significant financial risk unless promptly detected and hedged. We develop an outage identification method from public market signals grounded in the parametric quickest change detection (QCD) theory. Parametric QCD operates on stochastic data streams, distinguishing pre- and post-change regimes using the ratio of their respective probability density functions. To derive the density functions for normal and post-outage market signals, we exploit multi-parametric programming to decompose complex market signals into parametric random variables with a known density. These densities are then used to construct a QCD-based statistic that triggers an alarm as soon as the statistic exceeds an appropriate threshold. Numerical experiments on a stylized PJM testbed demonstrate rapid line outage identification from public streams of electricity demand and price data.</p>

            <p>We study the problem of non-parametric clustering of data sequences, where each data sequence comprises independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples generated from an unknown distribution. The true clusters are the clusters obtained using the Spectral clustering algorithm (SPEC) on the pairwise distance between the true distributions corresponding to the data sequences. Since the true distributions are unknown, the objective is to estimate the clusters by observing the minimum number of samples from the data sequences, given a specified error probability. To solve this problem, we propose the Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (SEQ-SPEC), and show that it stops in finite time almost surely and is exponentially consistent. We also propose a computationally more efficient algorithm called the Incremental Approximate Sequential Spectral clustering algorithm (IA-SEQ-SPEC). Through simulations, we show that both SEQ-SPEC and IA-SEQ-SPEC perform better than the fixed sample size SPEC, the Sequential $K$-Medoids clustering algorithm (SEQ-KMED), and the Sequential Single Linkage clustering algorithm (SEQ-SLINK). In addition, we propose memory-efficient versions, SEQ-SPEC-B and IA-SEQ-SPEC-B. Unlike other related sequential clustering algorithms, which require storing all past samples, these algorithms require storing only the most recent $B$ samples. Both the computationally efficient and memory-efficient versions of SEQ-SPEC perform comparably to SEQ-SPEC in simulations.</p>

            <p>Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor, average emission factor, and day-ahead market prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and Scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.</p>

            <h2>Distribution Steering for Discrete-Time Uncertain Ensemble Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyu Wu, Panagiotis Tsiotras, Anders Lindquist</p>
            <p>Ensemble systems appear frequently in many engineering applications and, as a result, they have become an important research topic in control theory. These systems are best characterized by the evolution of their underlying state distribution. Despite the work to date, few results exist dealing with the problem of directly modifying (i.e., ``steering'') the distribution of an ensemble system. In addition, in most existing results, the distribution of the states of an ensemble of discrete-time systems is assumed to be Gaussian. However, in case the system parameters are uncertain, it is not always realistic to assume that the distribution of the system follows a Gaussian distribution, thus complicating the solution of the overall problem. In this paper, we address the general distribution steering problem for first-order discrete-time ensemble systems, where the distributions of the system parameters and the states are arbitrary with finite first few moments. Linear system dynamics are considered using the method of power moments to transform the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. We also propose a control law for the ensuing moment system, which allows us to obtain the power moments of the desired control inputs. Finally, we solve the inverse problem to obtain the feasible control inputs from their corresponding power moments. We provide a numerical example to validate our theoretical developments.</p>

            <h2>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pavel Osinenko</p>
            <p>This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</p>

            <h2>$k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammed Adib Oumer, Vishnu Murali, Majid Zamani</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce two new types of barrier certificates that are based on multiple functions rather than a single one. A conventional barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system is a nonnegative real-valued function whose expected value does not increase as the system evolves. This requirement guarantees that the barrier certificate forms a nonnegative supermartingale and can be used to derive a lower bound on the probability that the system remains safe. A key advantage of such certificates is that they can be automatically searched for using tools such as optimization programs instantiated with a fixed template. When this search is unsuccessful, the common practice is to modify the template and attempt the synthesis again. Drawing inspiration from logical interpolation, we first propose an alternative framework that uses a collection of functions to jointly serve as a barrier certificate. We refer to this construct as an interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. Nonetheless, we observe that these certificates still require one function in the collection to satisfy a supermartingale condition. Motivated by recent work in the literature, we next combine k-induction with interpolation-inspired certificates to relax this supermartingale constraint. We develop a general and more flexible notion of barrier certificates, which we call k-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. This formulation encompasses multiple ways of integrating interpolation-inspired barrier certificates with k-induction. We highlight two specific instantiations among these possible combinations. For polynomial systems, we employ sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to synthesize the corresponding set of functions. Finally, through our case studies, we show that the proposed methods enable the use of simpler templates and yield tighter lower bounds on the safety probability.</p>

            <h2>XMAD-Bench: Cross-Domain Multilingual Audio Deepfake Benchmark</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioan-Paul Ciobanu, Andrei-Iulian Hiji, Nicolae-Catalin Ristea, Paul Irofti, Cristian Rusu, Radu Tudor Ionescu</p>
            <p>Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested "in the wild". Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Evaluating young children's language is challenging for automatic speech recognizers due to high-pitched voices, prolonged sounds, and limited data. We introduce K-Function, a framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription with objective, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven scoring. Its core, Kids-Weighted Finite State Transducer (K-WFST), merges an acoustic phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity model to capture child-specific speech errors while remaining fully interpretable. K-WFST achieves a 1.39 % phoneme error rate on MyST and 8.61 % on Multitudes-an absolute improvement of 10.47 % and 7.06 % over a greedy-search decoder. These high-quality transcripts are used by an LLM to grade verbal skills, developmental milestones, reading, and comprehension, with results that align closely with human evaluators. Our findings show that precise phoneme recognition is essential for creating an effective assessment framework, enabling scalable language screening for children.</p>

            <h2>Shared representations in brains and models reveal a two-route cortical organization during scene perception</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Marcos-Manchón, Lluís Fuentemilla</p>
            <p>The brain transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional cortical representations that support diverse cognitive and behavioral goals. Characterizing how this information is organized and routed across the human brain is essential for understanding how we process complex visual scenes. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis to 7T fMRI data collected during natural scene viewing. We quantified representational geometry shared across individuals and compared it to hierarchical features from vision and language neural networks. This analysis revealed two distinct processing routes: a ventromedial pathway specialized for scene layout and environmental context, and a lateral occipitotemporal pathway selective for animate content. Vision models aligned with shared structure in both routes, whereas language models corresponded primarily with the lateral pathway. These findings refine classical visual-stream models by characterizing scene perception as a distributed cortical network with separable representational routes for context and animate content.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Cui, Lei Zhu, Xiaohui Li, Zhihan Guo, Haoli Bai, Lu Hou, Irwin King</p>
            <p>Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) are specialized foundation models designed to enable natural, real-time spoken interactions by modeling complex conversational turn-taking such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. End-to-end (e2e) FD-SLMs leverage real-world double-channel conversational data to capture nuanced two-speaker dialogue patterns for human-like interactions, but their conversational abilities often degrade compared to pure-text conversation due to prolonged speech sequences and limited high-quality spoken dialogue data. Although interleaved text-speech generation could mitigate this degradation, integrating discrete text tokens into continuous double-channel audio streams could disrupt the precise time alignment required for fluid interaction. To address this, we propose TurnGuide, a novel text-speech interleaved generation approach for e2e FD-SLMs that dynamically segments assistant speech into dialogue turns and interleaves turn-level text and speech generation. This approach allows FD-SLMs to integrate the semantic intelligence of LLMs without compromising the natural acoustic flow. Extensive experiments show that TurnGuide not only significantly improves e2e FD-SLMs to produce semantically meaningful, coherent speech but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on various turn-taking events.

            <h2>Can the Waymo Open Motion Dataset Support Realistic Behavioral Modeling? A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanlin Zhang, Sungyong Chung, Nachuan Li, Dana Monzer, Hani S. Mahmassani, Samer H. Hamdar, Alireza Talebpour</p>
            <p>The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably, WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving. Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without proper validation against independently collected data.</p>

            <p>Although many models exist to detect singing voice deepfakes (SingFake), how these models operate, particularly with instrumental accompaniment, is unclear. We investigate how instrumental music affects SingFake detection from two perspectives. To investigate the behavioral effect, we test different backbones, unpaired instrumental tracks, and frequency subbands. To analyze the representational effect, we probe how fine-tuning alters encoders' speech and music capabilities. Our results show that instrumental accompaniment acts mainly as data augmentation rather than providing intrinsic cues (e.g., rhythm or harmony). Furthermore, fine-tuning increases reliance on shallow speaker features while reducing sensitivity to content, paralinguistic, and semantic information. These insights clarify how models exploit vocal versus instrumental cues and can inform the design of more interpretable and robust SingFake detection systems.</p>

            <h2>Anti-Jamming based on Beam-Steering Antennas and Intelligent UAV Swarm Behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago Silva, António Grilo</p>
            <p>In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue. This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further research.</p>

            <p>Creativity is a core cognitive capacity underlying innovation and adaptive problem solving, yet how it is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is not fully understood. While resting-state fMRI studies have identified large-scale network correlates associated with differences in creativity, EEG provides the temporal resolution for examining oscillatory dynamics contributing to intrinsic network organization. We examined whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with individual differences across multiple creativity-related measures. Thirty healthy young adults completed a multidimensional creativity battery comprising the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), the Divergent Association Task (DAT), the Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and a Self-rating (SR) of creative ability. Graph-theoretical analyses of alpha-band functional connectivity revealed two participant groups, each with distinct patterns of neural activity: Cluster 1 showed reduced global connectivity with relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity; Cluster 0 exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. Notably, Cluster 1 reported higher self-rated creative ability and more frequent engagement in real-world creative activities. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with variation in creative self-efficacy and creative engagement, highlighting characteristic patterns of alpha-band network organization observed at rest.</p>

            <p>Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at this https URL .</p>

            <h2>Covering in Hamming and Grassmann Spaces: New Bounds and Reed--Solomon-Based Constructions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samin Riasat, Hessam Mahdavifar</p>
            <p>We study covering problems in Hamming and Grassmann spaces through a unified coding-theoretic and information-theoretic framework. Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks. On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.</p>

It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components.

Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cel Thys, Rodney Martinez Alonso, Sofie Pollin</p>
            <p>This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</p>

            <h2>Zonotope Shadow and Reflection Matching: A Novel GNSS Reflection-Based Framework for Enhanced Positioning Accuracy in Urban Areas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghyun Kim, Jiwon Seo</p>
            <p>In urban areas, signal reception conditions are often poor due to reflections from buildings, resulting in inaccurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning. Various 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques, including shadow matching, have been proposed to address this issue. However, conventional shadow matching estimates positions in a discretized manner. The accuracy of this approach is limited by the resolution of the grid points representing the candidate receiver positions, making it difficult to achieve robust urban positioning and to ensure that the position estimate satisfies user-specified protection levels or safety bounds. To overcome these limitations, zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) has been proposed, which utilizes a set-based position estimate rather than grid-based estimates. ZSM calculates the GNSS shadow--an area on the ground where the line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked and only non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals can be received--to estimate the receiver's position set. ZSM distinguishes between LOS and NLOS satellites, determining that the receiver is inside the GNSS shadow if the satellite is NLOS and outside if the satellite is LOS. However, relying solely on GNSS shadows limits the ability to sufficiently reduce the size of the receiver position set and to precisely estimate the receiver's location. To address this, we propose zonotope shadow and reflection matching (ZSRM) to enhance positioning accuracy in urban areas. The proposed ZSRM technique is validated through field tests using GNSS signals collected in an urban environment. Consequently, the RMS horizontal position error of ZSRM improved by 10.0% to 53.6% compared with ZSM, while the RMS cross-street and along-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1% and 30.7% to 59.3%, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon D'Agostino, Jimmy Chen, Ram Rajagopal</p>
            <p>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) depends heavily on the reliability of charging infrastructure, yet approximately 1 in 5 drivers report being unable to charge during station visits due to inoperable equipment. While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent "zombie chargers" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Salamatmoghadasi, Amir Mehrabian, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Georges Kaddoum</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of radio access networks (RANs) is increasing energy consumption and challenging the sustainability of future systems. We consider a dense-urban vertical heterogeneous network (vHetNet) comprising a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as a super macro base station, a terrestrial macro base station (MBS), and multiple small base stations (SBSs). We propose a HAPS-enhanced cell-switching algorithm that selectively deactivates SBSs based on their traffic load and the capacity and channel conditions of both the MBS and HAPS. The resulting energy-minimization problem, subject to an outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and reformulated into a mixed-integer program for efficient solution. Using realistic 3GPP channel models, simulations show substantial energy savings versus All-ON, terrestrial cell switching, and sorting benchmarks. Relative to All-ON, the proposed method reduces power consumption by up to 77% at low loads and about 40% at high loads; a NoQoS variant achieves up to 90% and 47%, respectively. The approach maintains high served-traffic levels and provides a tunable trade-off between power efficiency and outage-based QoS, supporting scalable and sustainable 6G deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Baughman, Marena Trujillo, Bri-Mathias Hodge, Emily Jensen</p>
            <p>The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

            <h2>Beyond Uptime: Actionable Performance Metrics for EV Charging Site Operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon D'Agostino, Jimmy Chen, Ram Rajagopal</p>
            <p>The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) depends heavily on the reliability of charging infrastructure, yet approximately 1 in 5 drivers report being unable to charge during station visits due to inoperable equipment. While regulatory efforts such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program have established uptime requirements, these metrics are often simplistic, delayed, and fail to provide the diagnostic granularity needed by Charging Site Operators (CSOs). Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications. A case study involving 98 chargers at a California academic institution spanning 2018-2024 demonstrates that these metrics reveal persistent "zombie chargers" and high-frequency network instability that remain hidden in standard annual reporting.</p>

            <h2>Sustainable Vertical Heterogeneous Networks: A Cell Switching Approach with High Altitude Platform Station</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maryam Salamatmoghadasi, Amir Mehrabian, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Georges Kaddoum</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of radio access networks (RANs) is increasing energy consumption and challenging the sustainability of future systems. We consider a dense-urban vertical heterogeneous network (vHetNet) comprising a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as a super macro base station, a terrestrial macro base station (MBS), and multiple small base stations (SBSs). We propose a HAPS-enhanced cell-switching algorithm that selectively deactivates SBSs based on their traffic load and the capacity and channel conditions of both the MBS and HAPS. The resulting energy-minimization problem, subject to an outage-based quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program and reformulated into a mixed-integer program for efficient solution. Using realistic 3GPP channel models, simulations show substantial energy savings versus All-ON, terrestrial cell switching, and sorting benchmarks. Relative to All-ON, the proposed method reduces power consumption by up to 77% at low loads and about 40% at high loads; a NoQoS variant achieves up to 90% and 47%, respectively. The approach maintains high served-traffic levels and provides a tunable trade-off between power efficiency and outage-based QoS, supporting scalable and sustainable 6G deployments.</p>

            <h2>Determining optimal thermal energy storage charging temperature for cooling using integrated building and coil modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ju-Hong Oh, Seon-In Kim, Eui-Jong Kim</p>
            <p>Thermal energy storage (TES) systems coupled with heat pumps offer significant potential for improving building energy efficiency by shifting electricity demand to off-peak hours. However, conventional operating strategies maintain conservatively low chilled water temperatures throughout the cooling season, a practice that results in suboptimal heat pump performance. This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 °C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance. This study contributes a practical methodology for optimizing TES charging temperatures in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems while maintaining indoor setpoint temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Resource Allocation Scheme for Bistatic ISAC with Data Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Henninger, Lucas Giroto, Ahmed Elkelesh, Silvio Mandelli</p>
            <p>Bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables efficient reuse of the existing cellular infrastructure and is likely to play an important role in future sensing networks. In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link. Simulation results validate our approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect the sensing performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matt Baughman, Marena Trujillo, Bri-Mathias Hodge, Emily Jensen</p>
            <p>The shift from traditional synchronous generator (SG) based power generation to generation driven by power electronic devices introduces new dynamic phenomena and considerations for the control of large-scale power systems. In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akhilesh Raj, Swann Perarnau, Aniruddha Gokhale, Solomon Bekele Abera</p>
            <p>Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system. In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training. Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Event-Driven Deep RL Dispatcher for Post-Storm Distribution System Restoration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farshad Amani, Faezeh Ardali, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>Natural hazards such as hurricanes and floods damage power grid equipment, forcing operators to replan restoration repeatedly as new information becomes available. This paper develops a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) dispatcher that serves as a real-time decision engine for crew-to-repair assignments. We model restoration as a sequential, information-revealing process and learn an actor-critic policy over compact features such as component status, travel/repair times, crew availability, and marginal restoration value. A feasibility mask blocks unsafe or inoperable actions, such as power flow limits, switching rules, and crew-time constraints, before they are applied. To provide realistic runtime inputs without relying on heavy solvers, we use lightweight surrogates for wind and flood intensities, fragility-based failure, spatial clustering of damage, access impairments, and progressive ticket arrivals. In simulated hurricane and flood events, the learned policy updates crew decisions in real time as new field reports arrive. Because the runtime logic is lightweight, it improves online performance (energy-not-supplied, critical-load restoration time, and travel distance) compared with mixed-integer programs and standard heuristics. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 13- and 123-bus feeders with mixed hurricane/flood scenarios.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a customized microgrid planning algorithm and tool, HyMGP, for remote sites in arid regions, which is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. HyMGP is compared with HOMER Pro to evaluate its performance in optimizing the sizing of microgrid components, including photovoltaic panels (PVs), vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs), and battery energy storage systems (BESS), for remote and off-grid applications. The study focuses on a standalone microgrid in the Saudi Arabia, considering high solar irradiance, limited wind availability, and a constant load profile composed of continuous cathodic protection and daytime cooling. In the simulation environment, comparisons with HOMER solutions demonstrate the advantages of HyMGP, which provides optimal and more flexible solutions by allowing user-defined component specifications and strictly enforcing all constraints. Further analysis shows that incorporating wind turbines reduces the Net Present Cost (NPC) by decreasing the required PV and battery capacities. Increasing battery autonomy leads to a higher NPC in both PV-only and hybrid systems due to the need for larger storage. Finally, lithium iron phosphate (Li-ion LFP) batteries are found to be more cost effective than lead acid, offering lower NPCs due to their longer lifespan, deeper discharge capability, and fewer replacement cycles.</p>

            <h2>Safe Trajectory Gradient Flow Control of a Grid-Interfacing Inverter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trager Joswig-Jones, Baosen Zhang</p>
            <p>Grid-interfacing inverters serve as the interface between renewable energy resources and the electric power grid, offering fast, programmable control capabilities. However, their operation is constrained by hardware limitations, such as bounds on the current magnitude. Existing control methods for these systems often neglect these constraints during controller design and instead rely on ad hoc limiters, which can introduce instability or degrade performance. In this work, we present a control framework that directly incorporates constraints into the control of a voltage-source inverter. We propose a safe trajectory gradient flow controller, which applies the safe gradient flow method to a rolling horizon trajectory optimization problem to ensure that the states remain within a safe set defined by the constraints while directing the trajectory towards an optimal equilibrium point of a nonlinear program. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can drive the outputs of a simulated inverter system to optimal values and maintain state constraints, even when using a limited number of optimization steps per control cycle.</p>

            <p>Smart inverters are instrumental in the integration of distributed energy resources into the electric grid. Such inverters rely on communication layers for continuous control and monitoring, potentially exposing them to cyber-physical attacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). We propose to construct a defense strategy against a priori unknown FDIAs with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The first agent is an adversary that simulates and discovers various FDIA strategies, while the second agent is a defender in charge of detecting and locating FDIAs. This approach enables the defender to be trained against new FDIAs continuously generated by the adversary. In addition, we show that the detection skills of an MARL defender can be combined with those of a supervised offline defender through a transfer learning approach. Numerical experiments conducted on a distribution and transmission system demonstrate that: a) the proposed MARL defender outperforms the offline defender against adversarial attacks; b) the transfer learning approach makes the MARL defender capable against both synthetic and unseen FDIAs.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</p>

Our results demonstrate fundamental limitations of direct fringe-to-depth mapping without explicit phase information, with reconstruction errors approaching 75-95\% of the typical object depth range.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayda Nodel Hokmabadi, Chadi Assi</p>
            <p>Full-duplex communication substantially enhances spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission and reception on the same time-frequency resources. However, its practical deployment remains hindered by strong residual self-interference and inter-user interference, which severely degrade system performance. This work investigates a full-duplex MISO network that leverages movable-antenna base stations (MA-BS) and movable-element reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ME-RIS) to overcome these limitations in next-generation 6G systems. Unlike conventional fixed-geometry architectures, the proposed framework jointly optimizes antenna and RIS element positions, together with RIS phase shifts, to strengthen desired links while suppressing interference. Our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate through the joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming vectors, uplink transmit powers, RIS phase shifts, and the spatial locations of both the BS antennas and RIS elements. To solve this challenging nonconvex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is developed, employing semidefinite relaxation for beamforming design and successive convex approximation for position optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ME-RIS-assisted architecture with movable BS antennas offers substantial gains over conventional fixed-position full-duplex networks. These findings highlight the potential of integrating movable antennas with movable RIS elements as a key enabler for high-performance full-duplex operation in future 6G wireless systems.</p>

Considering imperfect channel information availability and realistic frequency selectivity behavior of each RIS's element response, we devise a distributed optimization approach based on consensus updates for the RISs' phase configurations. Our simulation results showcase that the proposed distributed design is superior to centralized schemes that are based on various Lorentzian-type wideband modeling approaches for the RISs.</p>

            <p>The Access Traffic Steering, Switching, and Splitting (ATSSS) defined in the 3GPP latest Release enables traffic flow over the multiple access paths to achieve the lower-latency End-to-end (E2E) delivery for 6G time-sensitive services.

This proposes a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-aided E2E multi-path uplink(UL) transmission architecture that explicitly accounts for both radio link latency and N3 backhaul latency, via the coupled designs of the UL traffic-splitting ratio, transmit power, receive combining, and RIS phase shift under practical constraints to achieve the minimum average E2E latency. We develop an alternating optimization framework that updates the above target parameters to be optimized. The simulations were conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed E2E optimization framework that lowers the average E2E latency up to 43% for a single user and 15% for the whole system compared with baselines.</p>

            <p>Reliable river flow forecasting is an essential component of flood risk management and early warning systems. It enables improved emergency response coordination and is critical for protecting infrastructure, communities, and ecosystems from extreme hydrological events. Process-based hydrological models and purely data-driven approaches often underperform during extreme events, particularly in forecasting peak flows. To address this limitation, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that couples Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF). XGBoost is employed for continuous streamflow forecasting, while RF is specifically trained for peak-flow prediction, and the two outputs are combined into an enhanced forecast. The approach is implemented across 857 catchments of the LamaH-CE dataset, using rainfall and discharge observations at 6-hour resolution. Results demonstrate consistently high skill, with 71% of catchments achieving a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) greater than 0.90. Peak-flow detection reaches 87%, with a false-alarm rate of 13%. Compared to the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), the framework achieves lower peak-magnitude errors, fewer false alarms, and improved streamflow and peak-flow forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally lightweight, scalable, and easily transferable across watersheds, with training times of only seconds on standard CPUs. These findings highlight the potential of integrating hydrological understanding with efficient machine learning to improve the accuracy and reliability of operational flood forecasting, and outline future directions for hybrid hydrological-machine learning model development.</p>

            <p>Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) provides high-resolution electricity consumption data that can enhance monitoring, diagnosis, and decision making in modern power distribution systems. Detecting anomalies in these time-series measurements is challenging due to nonlinear, nonstationary, and multi-scale temporal behavior across diverse building types and operating conditions. This work presents a systematic, power-system-oriented evaluation of a GAN-LSTM framework for smart meter anomaly detection using the Large-scale Energy Anomaly Detection (LEAD) dataset, which contains one year of hourly measurements from 406 buildings. The proposed pipeline applies consistent preprocessing, temporal windowing, and threshold selection across all methods, and compares the GAN-LSTM approach against six widely used baselines, including statistical, kernel-based, reconstruction-based, and GAN-based models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-LSTM significantly improves detection performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89. These findings highlight the potential of adversarial temporal modeling as a practical tool for supporting asset monitoring, non-technical loss detection, and situational awareness in real-world power distribution networks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jochen Stiasny, Jochen Cremer</p>
            <p>The energy transition challenges operational tasks based on simulations and optimisation. These computations need to be fast and flexible as the grid is ever-expanding, and renewables' uncertainty requires a flexible operational environment. Learned approximations, proxies or surrogates -- we refer to them as Neural Solvers -- excel in terms of evaluation speed, but are inflexible with respect to adjusting to changing tasks. Hence, neural solvers are usually applicable to highly specific tasks, which limits their usefulness in practice; a widely reusable, foundational neural solver is required. Therefore, this work proposes the Residual Power Flow (RPF) formulation. RPF formulates residual functions based on Kirchhoff's laws to quantify the infeasibility of an operating condition. The minimisation of the residuals determines the voltage solution; an additional slack variable is needed to achieve AC-feasibility. RPF forms a natural, foundational subtask of tasks subject to power flow constraints. We propose to learn RPF with neural solvers to exploit their speed. Furthermore, RPF improves learning performance compared to common power flow formulations. To solve operational tasks, we integrate the neural solver in a Predict-then-Optimise (PO) approach to combine speed and flexibility. The case study investigates the IEEE 9-bus system and three tasks (AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF), power-flow and quasi-steady state power flow) solved by PO. The results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of learning with RPF.</p>

This paper proposes an explainable, unsupervised multi-view anomaly detection framework for IEC 61850 GOOSE networks that explicitly separates semantic integrity and temporal availability. The approach employs asymmetric autoencoders trained only on real operational GOOSE traffic to learn distinct latent representations of sequence-based protocol semantics and timing-related transmission dynamics in normal traffic. Anomaly detection is implemented using reconstruction errors mixed with statistically grounded thresholds, enabling robust detection without specified attack types. Feature-level reconstruction analysis provides intrinsic explainability by directly linking detection outcomes to IEC 61850 protocol characteristics. The proposed framework is evaluated using real substation traffic for training and a public dataset containing normal traffic and message suppression, data manipulation, and denial-of-service attacks for testing. Experimental results show attack detection rates above 99% with false positives remaining below 5% of total traffic, demonstrating strong generalization across environments and effective operation under extreme class imbalance and interpretable anomaly attribution.</p>

            <h2>zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paritosh Ramanan, H.M. Mohaimanul Islam, Abhiram Reddy Alugula</p>
            <p>Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p>

            <h2>DRL-based Power Allocation in LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed A. Hassan, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir Elgorashi, Jaafar Elmirghani</p>
            <p>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for optical wireless communication (OWC), enabling multiple users to share the optical spectrum simultaneously through the power domain. However, the imperfection of channel state information (CSI) and residual errors in decoding process deteriorate the performance of NOMA, especially when multi-parameteric and realistic dense-user indoor scenarios are considered. In this work, we model a LiDAL-assisted RLNC-NOMA OWC system, where the light detection and localization (LiDAL) technique exploits spatio-temporal information to improve user CSI, while random linear network coding (RLNC) enhances data resilience in the NOMA successive decoding process. Power allocation (PA) is a crucial issue in communication systems, particularly in the modeled system, due to the complex interactions between multiple users and the coding and detection processes. However, optimizing continuous PA dynamically requires advanced techniques to avoid excessive computational complexity. Therefore, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to efficiently learn near-optimal power allocation strategies, enabling enhanced system performance. In particular, a DRL-based normalized advantage function (NAF) algorithm is proposed to maximize the average sum rate of the system, and its performance is analyzed and compared to other widely used DRL-based and conventional PA schemes, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), gain ratio PA (GRPA), and exhaustive search.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Cooling and Compute Management for AI Datacenters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nardos Belay Abera, Yize Chen</p>
            <p>The AI datacenters are currently being deployed on a large scale to support the training and deployment of power-intensive large-language models (LLMs). Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs. Using real Azure inference traces and detailed GPU profiling, our model balances serving latency and thermal constraints in AI datacenters while significantly improving AI datacenters' energy efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Jen Liu, Wei-Yu Chiu, Weiqi Hua</p>
            <p>In the 21st century, transitioning to renewable energy sources is imperative, with fossil fuel reserves depleting rapidly and recognizing critical environmental issues such as climate change, air pollution, water pollution, and habitat destruction. Embracing renewable energy is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic move with multiple benefits. By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information. Our results demonstrate lower transaction time by 41\% and energy consumption by 65\% compared to proof-of-stake.</p>

            <p>Residential users in demand response programs must balance electricity costs and user dissatisfaction under real-time pricing. This study proposes a multiobjective model predictive control approach for home energy management systems with battery storage, aiming to minimize both objectives while mitigating uncertainties. Laguerre functions parameterize control signals, transforming the optimization problem into one with linear inequalities for efficient exploration. A constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, incorporating convex sampler-based crossover and mutation, is developed to ensure feasible solutions. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches, limiting cost increases to 0.52\% under uncertainties, compared to at least 2.3\% with other methods.</p>

            <p>A key challenge with large battery systems is heterogeneous currents and temperatures in modules with parallel-connected cells. Although extreme currents and temperatures are detrimental to the performance and lifetime of battery cells, there is not a consensus on the scale of typical imbalances within grid storage modules. Here, we quantify these imbalances through simulations and experiments on an industrially representative grid storage battery module consisting of prismatic lithium iron phosphate cells, elucidating the evolution of current and temperature imbalances and their dependence on individual cell and module parameter variations. Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we investigate how these thresholds change for different applications, to outline a set of robustness metrics that show how cycling at lower C-rates and narrower SOC ranges can mitigate failures.</p>

            <p>The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.</p>

            <h2>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Xianbin Wang, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</p>

Its input layer integrates the coordinate measurement data of the dual radar, and the output layer represents the error compensation amount through the pulse emission frequency. The spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is used to adjust the neuron connection weights dynamically, and the trajectory distortion caused by system noise and radar ranging and angle measurement errors can be effectively suppressed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Desire Guel, Justin Pegd-Windé Kouraogo, Kouka Kouakou Nakoulma</p>
            <p>Deploying fifth-generation (5G) networks in emerging markets demands a balance between performance targets and constraints in budget, spectrum, and infrastructure. We use MATLAB simulations to quantify how radio and architectural levers - MIMO (beamforming, diversity, spatial multiplexing), carrier aggregation (CA), targeted spectrum refarming to New Radio (NR), mmWave propagation with blockage/rain, and Non-Standalone (NSA) versus Standalone (SA) cores - affect capacity, coverage, latency, and interference robustness, with D2D and M2M as complements to wide-area access. Beamforming improves cell-edge SNR by about 3-6 dB, while spatial multiplexing dominates at moderate/high SNR via multi-stream gains. Throughput scales strongly with CA: increasing from 1 to 5x20-MHz carriers raises peak rate from about 200 Mb/s to about 1 Gb/s at 30 dB SNR; water-filling adds 5-12% over equal power at mid-SNR. Targeted mid-band refarming to NR increases median throughput by 60-90% in urban and 40-70% in rural scenarios when sub-1-GHz layers preserve coverage. At 28 GHz, rain and human blockage add about 8-30 dB excess loss, so viable mmWave deployment concentrates in LOS hot zones with narrow-beam arrays and short inter-site distances. NSA delivers broader initial coverage than SA by reusing LTE/EPC, while SA becomes attractive as transport improves (e.g., >= 10 Gb/s and < 5 ms RTT) and site density grows. We synthesize these results into a practical roadmap: start NR on NSA, prioritize CA-centric spectrum strategies with focused refarming, densify selectively in demand hotspots, and migrate to SA as backhaul and device ecosystems mature.</p>

            <h2>Control and Stability of a Multilevel Power System for a Future Distribution Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xian Wu, Jan H. van Schuppen, Hai Xiang Lin</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into distribution networks poses significant challenges to frequency and voltage stability due to their intermittent nature and low-inertia dynamics. This paper proposes a multilevel control framework for a future decarbonized power system, using energy storage systems as power buffers to mitigate frequency and voltage fluctuations. A nonlinear interconnected model is formulated to characterize the complex dynamics across multiple levels of the distribution network. To reduce operational complexity and communication overhead of these dynamics, a distributed linear quadratic regulator control strategy is developed for information exchange in a bottom-up approach, where each level implements local feedback control within a short time horizon. Stability conditions for both open-loop and closed-loop systems are established using Lyapunov-based analysis. In addition, explicit performance bounds are derived to quantify the optimal difference between the proposed distributed strategy and the centralized control method, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Power-Water Coordination: Unlocking Flexibility in Hybrid RO Desalination Plants via Variable-Speed Pumps and Tank Mixing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongxing Hu, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>Water desalination plants (DPs) are among the most critical infrastructures and largest electricity loads in water-scarce regions worldwide. Although reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is the most energy-efficient and dominant technology, it remains energy-intensive but can offer substantial flexibility potential for power systems. This paper proposes a coordinated operation framework for power systems and DPs that explicitly accounts for both systems' operational constraints and fully unlocks DP flexibility. To achieve this, a detailed DP model is developed, incorporating the characteristics of an actual high-pressure pump with variable-speed operation, on-off operation with flushing requirements, water quality constraints, and water dynamics and salt mixing in the storage tank. By proactively managing freshwater storage and tank salinity in a closed-loop coordinated scheduling framework, the operational flexibility of the DP is significantly enhanced. With appropriate simplification and linearization, the resulting coordinated scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, and a two-step decomposed commitment-scheduling stochastic optimization (TDCSO) is proposed to efficiently address uncertainties. Case studies validate the proposed approach and demonstrate up to a 6% operating cost reduction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Verena Häberle, Kehao Zhuang, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>This paper presents preliminary results toward a conceptual foundation for Next Generation Grid Codes (NGGCs) based on decentralized stability and performance certification for dynamic ancillary services. The proposed NGGC framework targets two core outcomes: (i) guaranteed closed-loop stability and (ii) explicit performance assurances for power-system frequency and voltage dynamics. Stability is addressed using loop-shifting and passivity-based methods that yield local frequency-domain certificates for individual devices, enabling fully decentralized verification of the interconnected system. Performance is characterized by deriving quantitative bounds on key time-domain metrics (e.g., nadirs, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), steady-state deviations, and oscillation damping) through frequency-domain constraints on local device behavior. The framework is non-parametric and model-agnostic, accommodating a broad class of device dynamics under mild assumptions, and provides an initial unified approach to stability and performance certification without explicit device-model parameterization. As such, these results offer a principled starting point for the development of future grid codes and control design methodologies in modern power systems.</p>

            <h2>Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Hardware-Impaired Wireless Fronthaul</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) enhances spectral and energy efficiency compared to conventional cellular networks by enabling joint transmission and reception across a large number of distributed access points (APs). Since these APs are envisioned to be low-cost and densely deployed, hardware impairments, stemming from non-ideal radio-frequency (RF) chains, are unavoidable. While existing studies primarily address hardware impairments on the access side, the impact of hardware impairments on the wireless fronthaul link has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we fill this important gap by introducing a novel amplify-and-forward (AF) based wireless fronthauling scheme tailored for cell-free massive MIMO. Focusing on the uplink, we develop an analytical framework that jointly models the hardware impairments at both the APs and the fronthaul transceivers, derives the resulting end-to-end distorted signal expression, and quantifies the individual contribution of each impairment to the spectral efficiency. Furthermore, we design distortion-aware linear combiners that optimally mitigate these effects. Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains from distortion-aware processing and illustrate the potential of the proposed AF fronthauling scheme as a cost-effective enabler for future cell-free architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>In the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system, quantization affects performance in two key domains: the time-domain distortion introduced by finite-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the access points (APs), and the fronthaul quantization of signals sent to the central processing unit (CPU). Although quantizing twice may seem redundant, the ADC quantization in orthogonal frequency-division duplex (OFDM) systems appears in the time domain, and one must then convert to the frequency domain, where quantization can be applied only to the signals at active subcarriers. This reduces fronthaul load and avoids unnecessary distortion, since the ADC output spans all OFDM samples while only a subset of subcarriers carries useful information. While both quantization effects have been extensively studied in narrowband systems, their joint impact in practical wideband OFDM-based cell-free massive MIMO remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses the gap by modeling the joint distortion and proposing a fronthaul strategy in which each AP processes the received signal to reduce quantization artifacts before transmission. We develop an efficient estimation algorithm that reconstructs the unquantized time-domain signal prior to fronthaul transmission and evaluate its effectiveness. The proposed design offers new insights for implementing efficient, quantization-aware uplink transmission in wideband cell-free architectures.</p>

            <p>Wave Energy Converters, particularly point absorbers, have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for harvesting ocean wave energy. Nevertheless, achieving high conversion efficiency remains challenging due to the inherently complex and nonlinear interactions between incident waves and device motion dynamics. This study develops an optimal adaptive damping control model for the power take-off (PTO) system by coupling Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework enables real-time communication between high-fidelity SPH simulations and intelligent control agents that learn coordinated policies to maximise energy capture. In each training episode, the SPH-based environment provides instantaneous hydrodynamic states to the agents, which output continuous damping actions and receive rewards reflecting power absorption. The Multi-Agent Soft Actor Critic algorithm is employed within a centralised-training and decentralised-execution scheme to ensure stable learning in continuous, multi-body systems. The entire platform is implemented in a unified GPU-accelerated C++ environment, allowing long-horizon training and large-scale three-dimensional simulations. The approach is validated through a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional benchmark cases under regular and irregular wave conditions. Compared with constant PTO damping, the learned control policy increases overall energy capture by 23.8% and 21.5%, respectively, demonstrating the strong potential of intelligent control for improving the performance of wave energy converter arrays. The developed three-dimensional GPU-accelerated multi-agent platform in computational hydrodynamics, is extendable to other fluid-structure interaction engineering problem that require real-time, multi-body coordinated control.</p>

Additionally, the integration of AI with emerging technologies, such as massive multiple-input and multiple-output, intelligent reflecting surfaces, and privacy-enhancing mechanisms, is discussed, highlighting their potential to propel the next generation of wireless networks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengqi Ma, Aihua Xia</p>
            <p>Accurate wireless localization underpins applications from autonomous systems to smart infrastructure. We study the mean-squared error (MSE) and conditional MSE (CMSE) of a practical fusion-based estimator in d-dimensional, stationary isotropic (translation- and rotation-invariant) random sensor networks, where a central processor combines received-signal-strength (RSS) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements to infer a target's position. Our contributions are twofold. First, we establish an approximation theorem: when measurement noise is sufficiently large, the joint law of RSS and AOA observations under a broad class of stationary isotropic deployments is, in distribution, indistinguishable from that induced by a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Second, leveraging this equivalence, we investigate a homogeneous PPP-based sensor network. We propose a fusion-based estimator in which a central processor aggregates RSS and AOA measurements from a set of spatially distributed sensors to infer the target position. For this PPP deployment within a finite observation region, we derive tractable analytical upper bounds for both the MSE and CMSE, establishing explicit scaling laws with respect to sensor density, observation radius, and noise variance. The approximation theorem then certifies these PPP-based bounds as reasonable proxies for non-Poisson deployments in noisy regimes. Overall, the results translate deployment and sensing parameters into achievable accuracy targets and provide robust, cost-aware guidance for the design of next-generation location-aware wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Nirjhar Alam, Wesley Reinhart, Rebecca Napolitano</p>
            <p>Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) combines depth resolution, non-destructive operation, and broad material sensitivity, yet it has seen limited use in diagnosing building envelopes. The compact geometry of wall assemblies, where reflections from closely spaced studs, sheathing, and cladding strongly overlap, has made systematic inversion difficult. Recent advances in data-driven interpretation provide an opportunity to revisit this challenge and assess whether machine learning can reliably extract structural information from such complex signals. Here, we develop a GPR-based inversion framework that decomposes wall diagnostics into classification tasks addressing vertical (stud presence) and lateral (wall-type) variations. Alongside model development, we implement multiple feature minimization strategies - including recursive elimination, agglomerative clustering, and L0-based sparsity - to promote fidelity and interpretability. Among these approaches, the L0-based sparse neural network (SparseNN) emerges as particularly effective: it exceeds Random Forest accuracy while relying on only a fraction of the input features, each linked to identifiable dielectric interfaces. SHAP analysis further confirms that the SparseNN learns reflection patterns consistent with physical layer boundaries. In summary, this framework establishes a foundation for physically interpretable and data-efficient inversion of wall assemblies using GPR radargrams. Although defect detection is not addressed here, the ability to reconstruct intact envelope structure and isolate features tied to key elements provides a necessary baseline for future inversion and anomaly-analysis tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Hilsenrath, Daniel R. Herber</p>
            <p>Flexible spacecraft structures present significant challenges for physical and control system design due to nonlinear dynamics, mission constraints, environmental variables, and changing operational conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for constructing reduced-order surrogate models of a flexible spacecraft using the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), followed by optimal sensor/actuator pair placement. Highfidelity simulation data from a nonlinear flexible spacecraft model, including coupled rigid-body and elastic modes, are captured by defining a mesh of nodes over the spacecraft body. The data-driven methods are then used to construct a modal model from the time histories of these node points. Optimal sensor/actuator placement for controllability and observability is performed via a nonlinear programming technique that maximizes the singular values of the Hankel matrix. Finally, the sensor placement and dynamics modeling approach is iterated to account for changes in the dynamic system introduced by sensor/actuator physical mass. The proposed methodology enables initialization of physical modeling without requiring a direct analytical model and provides a practical solution for onboard implementation in model-based control and estimation systems. Results demonstrate optimal design methodology with substantial model-order reduction while preserving dynamic fidelity, and provide insight into effective sensor-actuator configurations for estimation and control.</p>

            <p>Koopman operator recently gained increasing attention in the control systems community for its abilities to bridge linear and nonlinear systems. Data driven Koopman operator approximations have established themselves as key enablers for system identification and model predictive control. Nonetheless, such methods commonly entail a preselected definition of states in the function space leading to high dimensional overfitting models and degraded long term prediction performances. We address this problem by proposing a hierarchical probabilistic approach for the Koopman model identification problem. In our method, elements of the model are treated as random variables and the posterior estimates are found using variational Bayesian (VB) inference updates. Our model distinguishes from others in the integration of inclusion flags. By the help of the inclusion flags, we intuitively threshold the probability of each state in the model. We then propose a graph search based algorithm to reduce the preselected states of the Koopman model. We demonstrate that our reduction method overcomes numerical instabilities and the reduced models maintain performance in simulated and real experiments.</p>

            <h2>Timing Fragility Aware Selective Hardening of RISCV Soft Processors on SRAM Based FPGAs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mostafa Darvishi</p>
            <p>Selective hardening is widely employed to improve the reliability of FPGA based soft processors while limiting the overhead of full redundancy. However, existing approaches primarily rely on architectural criticality or functional fault analysis, overlooking the impact of routing dependent timing sensitivity on processor robustness. This paper introduces a timing fragility aware selective hardening methodology for RISCV soft processors implemented on SRAM based FPGAs. Building on recent advances in in situ timing observability, the proposed approach quantifies the statistical timing sensitivity of pipeline components under controlled routing perturbations and uses this information to guide hardening decisions. Experimental results on a RISCV processor implemented on a commercial FPGA platform show that components exhibiting higher timing fragility also demonstrate increased vulnerability to routing induced delay effects. Leveraging this correlation, the proposed selective hardening strategy achieves robustness comparable to full hardening while significantly reducing area and timing overhead. These results demonstrate that timing fragility provides a practical and effective metric for reliability aware design optimization in FPGA based processor architectures.</p>

            <h2>Performance Analysis of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA in Block-Based Image Compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yashika Ahlawat</p>
            <p>Block based image compression relies on transform coding to concentrate signal energy into a small number of coefficients. While classical codecs use fixed transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), data driven methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are theoretically optimal for decorrelation. This paper presents an experimental comparison of DCT, Hadamard, and PCA across multiple block sizes and compression rates. Using rate distortion and energy compaction analysis, we show that PCA outperforms fixed transforms only when block dimensionality is sufficiently large, while DCT remains near optimal for standard block sizes such as $8\times8$ and at low bit rates. These results explain the robustness of DCT in practical codecs and highlight the limitations of block wise learned transforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soundes Oumaima Boufaida, Abdemadjid Benmachiche, Majda Maatallah</p>
            <p>Embedded vision systems need efficient and robust image processing algorithms to perform real-time, with resource-constrained hardware. This research investigates image processing algorithms, specifically edge detection, corner detection, and blob detection, that are implemented on embedded processors, including DSPs and FPGAs. To address latency, accuracy and power consumption noted in the image processing literature, optimized algorithm architectures and quantization techniques are employed. In addition, optimal techniques for inter-frame redundancy removal and adaptive frame averaging are used to improve throughput with reasonable image quality. Simulations and hardware trials of the proposed approaches show marked improvements in the speed and energy efficiency of processing as compared to conventional implementations. The advances of this research facilitate a path for scalable and inexpensive embedded imaging systems for the automotive, surveillance, and robotics sectors, and underscore the benefit of co-designing algorithms and hardware architectures for practical real-time embedded vision applications.</p>

            <h2>FastSLM: Hierarchical Frame Q-Former for Effective Speech Modality Adaptation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junseok Lee, Sangyong Lee, Chang-Jae Chun</p>
            <p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-expert-level capabilities, driving significant interest in their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). In particular, there is growing momentum in adapting LLMs to various modalities, including vision, video, and speech, through the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, existing speech-language model (SLM) research has largely overlooked cost-effective adaptation strategies for leveraging LLMs in the speech domain. In this paper, we propose FastSLM, a lightweight yet efficient SLM designed for effective understanding and reasoning over long-form speech. To address the challenge of aligning high-frame-rate speech features with LLMs, we introduce the Hierarchical Frame Querying Transformer (HFQ-Former), which compresses frame-level speech features while capturing both local and global context. Furthermore, we present a novel three-stage training strategy that enhances generalization across a wide range of speech-related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that FastSLM achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, despite operating with significantly lower FLOPs and parameter counts, while representing speech with only 1.67 tokens per second.

            <h2>Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Video Transmission with Asymmetric Context</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuechen Chen, Junting Li, Chuang Chen, Hairong Lin, Yishen Li</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a high-efficiency deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for video transmission based on conditional coding with asymmetric context. The conditional coding-based neural video compression requires to predict the encoding and decoding conditions from the same context which includes the same reconstructed frames. However in JSCC schemes which fall into pseudo-analog transmission, the encoder cannot infer the same reconstructed frames as the decoder even a pipeline of the simulated transmission is constructed at the encoder. In the proposed method, without such a pipeline, we guide and design neural networks to learn encoding and decoding conditions from asymmetric contexts. Additionally, we introduce feature propagation, which allows intermediate features to be independently propagated at the encoder and decoder and help to generate conditions, enabling the framework to greatly leverage temporal correlation while mitigating the problem of error accumulation. To further exploit the performance of the proposed transmission framework, we implement content-adaptive coding which achieves variable bandwidth transmission using entropy models and masking mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deep video transmission frameworks in terms of performance and effectively mitigates the error accumulation. By mitigating the error accumulation, our schemes can reduce the frequency of inserting intra-frame coding modes, further enhancing performance.</p>

            <h2>Auditory Filter Behavior and Updated Estimated Constants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samiya A Alkhairy</p>
            <p>Filters from the Gammatone family are often used to model auditory signal processing, but the filter constant values used to mimic human hearing are largely set to values based on historical psychoacoustic data collected several decades ago. Here, we move away from this long-standing convention, and estimate filter constants using a range of more recent reported filter characteristics (such as quality factors and ratios between quality factors and peak group delay) within a characteristics-based framework that clarifies how filter behavior is related to the underlying constants. Using a sharp-filter approximation that captures shared peak-region behavior across certain classes of filters, we analyze the range of behaviors accessible when the full degrees of freedom of the filter are utilized rather than fixing the filter order or exponent to historically prescribed values. Filter behavior is characterized using magnitude-based and phase-based characteristics and their ratios, which reveal which characteristics are informative for constraining filter constants and which are only weakly constraining. We show that these insights and estimation methods extend to multiple realizable filter classes from the Gammatone family and apply them, together with recent physiological and psychoacoustic observations, to derive constraints on and estimates for filter constants for human auditory filters. More broadly, this framework supports the design of auditory filters with arbitrary characteristic-level specifications and enables systematic assessment of how variations in filter characteristics influence auditory models, perceptual findings, and technologies that rely on auditory filterbanks.</p>

            <h2>TagSpeech: End-to-End Multi-Speaker ASR and Diarization with Fine-Grained Temporal Grounding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingyue Huo, Yiwen Shao, Yuheng Zhang</p>
            <p>We present TagSpeech, a unified LLM-based framework that utilizes Temporal Anchor Grounding for joint multi-speaker ASR and diarization. The framework is built on two key designs: (1) decoupled semantic and speaker streams fine-tuned via Serialized Output Training (SOT) to learn turn-taking dynamics; and (2) an interleaved time anchor mechanism that not only supports fine-grained timestamp prediction but also acts as a synchronization signal between semantic understanding and speaker tracking. Compared to previous works that primarily focus on speaker-attributed ASR or implicit diarization, TagSpeech addresses the challenge of fine-grained speaker-content alignment and explicitly models "who spoke what and when" in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on AMI and AliMeeting benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in Diarization Error Rate (DER) over strong end-to-end baselines, including Qwen-Omni and Gemini, particularly in handling complex speech overlaps. Moreover, TagSpeech employs a parameter-efficient training paradigm in which the LLM backbone is frozen and only lightweight projectors are trained, resulting in strong performance with low computational cost.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Fontanella, Kristjan Milic, Alan Facchinetti, Sara Muggiasca, Marco Belloli</p>
            <p>Wake interactions in floating wind farms are inherently coupled to platform motion, yet most experimental studies to date neglect this two-way coupling by prescribing platform movements. This work presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) wind-tunnel methodology to investigate wake interactions between two floating wind turbines with fully coupled aerodynamic loading and platform dynamics. The approach integrates physical wind-tunnel testing of two scaled rotors with a real-time numerical model that accounts for platform motion, mooring restoring forces, and hydrodynamic loads. Experiments conducted under low-turbulence inflow conditions show that a downstream turbine operating in the wake of an upstream turbine experiences reduced mean thrust and platform deflections due to the decreased inflow velocity, alongside enhanced low-frequency platform motions driven by increased turbulent energy in the wake. The proposed HIL framework provides a controlled experimental basis for studying wake-induced excitation mechanisms and supports the validation of floating wind farm models and control strategies.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Energy Landscape Model for Analyzing Brain State Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Triet M. Tran, Seyed Majid Razavi, Dee H. Wu, Sina Khanmohammadi</p>
            <p>Energy landscape models characterize neural dynamics by assigning energy values to each brain state that reflect their stability or probability of occurrence. The conventional energy landscape models rely on binary brain state representation, where each region is considered either active or inactive based on some signal threshold. However, this binarization leads to significant information loss and an exponential increase in the number of possible brain states, making the calculation of energy values infeasible for large numbers of brain regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel continuous energy landscape framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a continuous precision matrix directly from functional MRI (fMRI) signals, preserving the full range of signal values during energy landscape computation. We validated our approach using both synthetic data and real-world fMRI datasets from brain tumor patients. Our results on synthetic data generated from a switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and a Kuramoto model show that the continuous energy model achieved higher likelihood and more accurate recovery of basin geometry, state occupancy, and transition dynamics than conventional binary energy landscape models. In addition, results from the fMRI dataset indicate a 0.27 increase in AUC for predicting working memory and executive function, along with a 0.35 improvement in explained variance (R2) for predicting reaction time. These findings highlight the advantages of utilizing the full signal values in energy landscape models for capturing neuronal dynamics, with strong implications for diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders.</p>

            <h2>DIVINE: Coordinating Multimodal Disentangled Representations for Oro-Facial Neurological Disorder Assessment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Muskaan Singh</p>
            <p>In this study, we present a multimodal framework for predicting neuro-facial disorders by capturing both vocal and facial cues. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio- only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Girish, Farhan Sheth, Muskaan Singh</p>
            <p>We propose a unified framework for not only attributing synthetic speech to its source but also for detecting speech generated by synthesizers that were not encountered during training. This requires methods that move beyond simple detection to support both detailed forensic analysis and open-set generalization. To address this, we introduce SIGNAL, a hybrid framework that combines speech foundation models (SFMs) with graph-based modeling and open-set-aware inference. Our framework integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier, allowing it to capture meaningful relationships between utterances and recognize speech that doesn`t belong to any known generator. It constructs a query-conditioned graph over generator class prototypes, enabling the GNN to reason over relationships among candidate generators, while the KNN branch supports open-set detection via confidence-based thresholding. We evaluate SIGNAL using the DiffSSD dataset, which offers a diverse mix of real speech and synthetic audio from both open-source and commercial diffusion-based TTS systems. To further assess generalization, we also test on the SingFake benchmark. Our results show that SIGNAL consistently improves performance across both tasks, with Mamba-based embeddings delivering especially strong results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to unify graph-based learning and open-set detection for tracing synthetic speech back to its origin.</p>

            <p>This study presents an effective autofocusing approach for synthetic aperture radar imaging of the human body under conditions of respiratory motion. The proposed method suppresses respiratory-motion-induced phase errors by separating radar echoes in the spatial- and time-frequency domains and estimating phase errors individually for each separated echo. By compensating for the estimated phase errors, synthetic aperture radar images focused on all scattering points are generated, even when multiple body parts exhibit different motions due to respiration. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments with four participants in the supine position. Compared with a conventional method, the proposed approach improves image quality by a factor of 5.1 in terms of Muller-Buffington sharpness, and reduces the root-mean-square error with respect to a reference point cloud from 34 mm to 20 mm.</p>

            <h2>Digital Twin for Ultra-Reliable & Low-Latency 6G Wireless Communications in Dense Urban City</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
            <p>High-frequency deployments in dense cities are difficult to plan because coverage, interference, and service reliability depend sensitively on local morphology. This paper develops a geometric Digital Twin (DT) of the Sunway City and uses it to study the service implications of a multi-site mmWave deployment. The DT is constructed from geo-referenced three-dimensional meshes of buildings, roads, and open areas, assembled in Blender and exported as a mesh scene. A seven-transmitter downlink at 10 GHz is then embedded into this geometry and evaluated using a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine that returns path-gain and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) fields over a dense grid of user locations. These fields are mapped to achievable throughput and compared against representative target rates for immersive extended reality (XR), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). The resulting maps show that favourable streets and courtyards form narrow high rate corridors surrounded by deep shadows, even within a dense area. In the baseline deployment, one fifth of the simulated area can maintain 100 Mbps URLLC rates, and less than 10% of cells can reach 1.7 Gbps for XR, despite the presence of several rooftop sites. By exploiting the DT, we further quantify the macro-diversity margin between the best and second best serving sites and show that most URLLC-feasible cells have several decibels of SINR headroom that could be harvested through dual connectivity. The study shows how a city DT can translate ray tracing output into service centric metrics and planning insights, complementing both analytical models and expensive measurement campaigns.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdikarim Mohamed Ibrahim, Rosdiadee Nordin</p>
            <p>LoRaWAN deployments rely on rough range estimates or simplified propagation models to decide where to place/mount gateways. As a result, operators have limited visibility into how rooftop choice, streets, and building shadowing jointly affect coverage and reliability. This paper addresses the problem of gateway placement in dense urban environments by combining a geometry accurate Digital Twin (DT) with a GPU accelerated ray tracing engine. Existing studies optimize placement on abstract grids or tune models with sparse measurements; few works evaluate LoRaWAN gateways on a full 3D city model using a realistic link budget. In this paper, we develop a DT with ITU radio materials and evaluate eight candidate rooftops for RAK7289 WisGate Edge Pro gateways under a sub-GHz link budget derived from the data sheet. For each rooftop, we obtain Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) on a 5 meter grid, derive robust and edge coverage indicators, and apply a greedy maximum coverage algorithm to rank sites and quantify the benefit of incremental densification. Results show that a single rooftop gateway covers one fifth of the full Sunway twin (i.e., the DT) at a robust SNR threshold, and that six sites still leave large areas of single gateway or out of coverage cells in surrounding residential streets. The findings from this paper shows that DT and ray tracing tools enable network operators to bridge the gap of expensive real-world trials and planning to identify if the planned LoRaWAN gateway is sufficient or additional sites are required.</p>

            <p>This paper deals with analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant control and attack-resilient of cyber-physical control systems. In our recent work, it has been observed that an attack detector driven by an input residual signal is capable of reliably detecting attacks. In particular, observing system dynamics from the perspective of the system input-output signal space reveals that attacks and system uncertainties act on different system subspaces. These results motivate our exploration of secure and safe cyber-physical control systems in the unified framework of control and detection. The unified framework is proposed to handle control and detection issues uniformly and in subspaces of system input-output data. Its mathematical and control-theoretic basis is system coprime factorizations with Bezout identity at its core. We firstly explore those methods and schemes of the unified framework, which serve as the major control-theoretic tool in our work. It is followed by re-visiting and examining established attack detection and resilient control schemes. The major part of our work is the endeavours to develop a control-theoretic paradigm, in which analysis, simultaneous detection of faults and attacks, fault-tolerant and attack-resilient control of cyber-physical control systems are addressed in a unified manner.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the problem of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) for rigid body systems evolving in three-dimensional space. We introduce a novel matrix Lie group structure, denoted SE_{3+n}(3), that unifies the pose, gravity, linear velocity, and landmark positions within a consistent geometric framework tailored to the VIO problem. Building upon this formulation, we design an almost globally asymptotically stable nonlinear geometric observer that tightly integrates data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visual sensors. Unlike conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)-based estimators that rely on local linearization and thus ensure only local convergence, the proposed observer achieves almost global stability through the decoupling of the rotational and translational dynamics. A globally exponentially stable Riccati-based translational observer along with an almost global input-to-state stable attitude observer are designed such that the overall cascaded observer enjoys almost global asymptotic stability. This cascaded architecture guarantees robust and consistent estimation of the extended state, including orientation, position, velocity, gravity, and landmark positions, up to the VIO unobservable directions (i.e., a global translation and rotation about gravity). The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations as well as experimental validation on the EuRoC MAV dataset, highlighting its robustness and suitability for real-world VIO applications.</p>

            <p>Computed Laminography (CL) is a key non-destructive testing technology for the visualization of internal structures in large planar objects. The inherent scanning geometry of CL inevitably results in inter-layer aliasing artifacts, limiting its practical application, particularly in electronic component inspection. While deep learning (DL) provides a powerful paradigm for artifact removal, its effectiveness is often limited by the domain gap between synthetic data and real-world data. In this work, we present LaminoDiff, a framework to integrate a diffusion model with a high-fidelity prior representation to bridge the domain gap in CL imaging. This prior, generated via a dual-modal CT-CL fusion strategy, is integrated into the proposed network as a conditional constraint. This integration ensures high-precision preservation of circuit structures and geometric fidelity while suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real PCB datasets demonstrate that LaminoDiff achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with competitive performance in artifact suppression and detail recovery. More importantly, the results facilitate reliable automated defect recognition.</p>

            <p>We investigate antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. The objective is to enhance the output direct current (DC) power under RF combining and DC combining schemes by jointly exploiting gains from antenna coding, beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity. We first propose the MIMO WPT system model with binary and continuous antenna coding using the beamspace channel model and formulate the joint antenna coding and beamforming optimization using a nonlinear rectenna model. We propose two efficient closed-form successive convex approximation algorithms to efficiently optimize the beamforming. To further reduce the computational complexity, we propose codebook-based antenna coding designs for output DC power maximization based on K-means clustering. Results show that the proposed pixel antenna empowered MIMO WPT system with binary antenna coding increases output DC power by more than 15 dB compared with conventional systems with fixed antenna configuration. With continuous antenna coding, the performance improves another 6 dB. Moreover, the proposed codebook design outperforms previous designs by up to 40% and shows good performance with reduced computational complexity. Overall, the significant improvement in output DC power verifies the potential of leveraging antenna coding utilizing pixel antennas to enhance WPT systems.</p>

            <p>Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a key imaging technique for characterizing cavitation activity in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Recent model-based beamforming algorithms offer high reconstruction quality and strong physical interpretability. However, their computational burden and limited temporal resolution restrict their use in applications with time-evolving cavitation. To address these challenges, we introduce a PAM beamforming framework based on a novel convolutional formulation in the time domain, which enables efficient computation. In this framework, PAM is formulated as an inverse problem in which the forward operator maps spatiotemporal cavitation activity to recorded radio-frequency signals accounting for time-of-flight delays defined by the acquisition geometry. We then formulate a regularized inversion algorithm that incorporates prior knowledge on cavitation activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms classical beamforming methods, providing higher temporal resolution than frequency-domain techniques while substantially reducing computational burden compared with iterative time-domain formulations.</p>

            <h2>Directional reflection modeling via wavenumber-domain reflection coefficient for 3D acoustic field simulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoshi Hoshika, Takahiro Iwami, Akira Omoto</p>
            <p>This study proposes a framework for incorporating wavenumber-domain acoustic reflection coefficients into sound field analysis to characterize direction-dependent material reflection and scattering phenomena. The reflection coefficient is defined as the amplitude ratio between incident and reflected waves for each propagation direction and is estimated from spatial Fourier transforms of the incident and reflected sound fields. The resulting wavenumber-domain reflection coefficients are converted into an acoustic admittance representation that is directly compatible with numerical methods such as the Boundary Element Method (BEM), enabling simulation of reflections beyond simple specular components. Unlike conventional extended reaction models, the proposed approach avoids explicit modeling of the material interior. This significantly reduces computational cost while allowing direct use of measured data, empirical models, or user-defined directional reflection characteristics. The validity of the proposed formulation was previously demonstrated by the authors through two-dimensional sound field simulations, in which accurate reproduction of direction-dependent reflection behavior was confirmed. In the present work, the framework is extended to three-dimensional analysis, demonstrating its applicability to more realistic and complex acoustic environments. The proposed approach provides a practical and flexible tool for simulating direction-dependent acoustic reflections and scattering, with potential applications in architectural acoustics, material characterization, and noise control.</p>

            <p>Fully convolutional networks have become the backbone of modern medical imaging due to their ability to learn multi-scale representations and perform end-to-end inference. Yet their potential for slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), the task of jointly estimating 3D anatomy and slice poses from misaligned 2D acquisitions, remains underexplored. We introduce a fast convolutional framework that fuses multiple orthogonal 2D slice stacks to recover coherent 3D structure and refines slice alignment through lightweight model-based optimization. Applied to fetal brain MRI, our approach reconstructs high-quality 3D volumes in under 10s, with 1s slice registration and accuracy on par with state-of-the-art iterative SVR pipelines, offering more than speedup. The framework uses non-rigid displacement fields to represent transformations, generalizing to other SVR problems like fetal body and placental MRI. Additionally, the fast inference time paves the way for real-time, scanner-side volumetric feedback during MRI acquisition.</p>

            <h2>Energy-efficient torque allocation for straight-line driving of electric vehicles based on pseudoconvex polynomials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josip Kir Hromatko, Šandor Ileš, Branimir Škugor, Joško Deur</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles with multiple motors provide a flexibility in meeting the driver torque demand, which calls for minimizing the battery energy consumption through torque allocation. In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems.</p>

            <h2>Vector Quantized-Aided XL-MIMO CSI Feedback with Channel Adaptive Transmission</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhang Ma, Nan Ma, Jianqiao Chen, Wenkai Liu</p>
            <p>Efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for 6G extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems to mitigate channel interference. However, the massive antenna scale imposes a severe burden on feedback overhead. Meanwhile, existing quantized feedback methods face dual challenges of limited quantization precision and insufficient channel robustness when compressing high-dimensional channel features into discrete symbols. To reduce these gaps, guided by the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) framework, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-aided scheme for CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems considering the near-field effect, named VQ-DJSCC-F. Firstly, taking advantage of the sparsity of near-field channels in the polar-delay domain, we extract energy-concentrated features to reduce dimensionality. Then, we simultaneously design the Transformer and CNN (convolutional neural network) architectures as the backbones to hierarchically extract CSI features, followed by VQ modules projecting features into a discrete latent space. The entropy loss regularization in synergy with an exponential moving average (EMA) update strategy is introduced to maximize quantization precision. Furthermore, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to mitigate the impact of wireless channel fading on the transmission of index sequences. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior CSI reconstruction accuracy with lower feedback overheads under varying channel conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimin Wang, Jieming Ke, Jin Guo, Yanlong Zhao</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the parameter estimation in a bandwidth-constrained sensor network communicating through an insecure medium. The sensor performs a local quantization, and transmits a 1-bit message to an estimation center through a wireless medium where the transmission of information is vulnerable to attackers. Both eavesdroppers and data tampering attackers are considered in our setting. A differential privacy method is used to protect the sensitive information against eavesdroppers. Then, a recursive projection algorithm is proposed such that the estimation center achieves the almost sure convergence and mean-square convergence when quantized measurements, differential privacy, and data tampering attacks are considered in a uniform framework. A privacy analysis including the convergence rate with privacy or without privacy is given. Further, we extend the problem to multi-agent systems. For this case, a distributed recursive projection algorithm is proposed with guaranteed almost sure and mean square convergence. A simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Pulido, Francesc Wilhelmi, Sergio Fortes, Alfonso Fernández-Durán, Lorenzo Galati Giordano, Raquel Barco</p>
            <p>Synthetic data generation is an appealing tool for augmenting and enriching datasets, playing a crucial role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Not only does synthetic data help build robust AI/ML datasets cost-effectively, but it also offers privacy-friendly solutions and bypasses the complexities of storing large data volumes. This paper proposes a novel method to generate synthetic data, based on first-order auto-regressive noise statistics, for large-scale Wi-Fi deployments. The approach operates with minimal real data requirements while producing statistically rich traffic patterns that effectively mimic real Access Point (AP) behavior. Experimental results show that ML models trained on synthetic data achieve Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values within 10 to 15 of those obtained using real data when trained on the same APs, while requiring significantly less training data. Moreover, when generalization is required, synthetic-data-trained models improve prediction accuracy by up to 50 percent compared to real-data-trained baselines, thanks to the enhanced variability and diversity of the generated traces. Overall, the proposed method bridges the gap between synthetic data generation and practical Wi-Fi traffic forecasting, providing a scalable, efficient, and real-time solution for modern wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Martin, Giuseppe Belgioioso</p>
            <p>We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.</p>

            <h2>Safe Navigation under Uncertain Obstacle Dynamics using Control Barrier Functions and Constrained Convex Generators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Matias, Daniel Silvestre</p>
            <p>This paper presents a sampled-data framework for the safe navigation of controlled agents in environments cluttered with obstacles governed by uncertain linear dynamics. Collision-free motion is achieved by combining Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based safety filtering with set-valued state estimation using Constrained Convex Generators (CCGs). At each sampling time, a CCG estimate of each obstacle is obtained using a finite-horizon guaranteed estimation scheme and propagated over the sampling interval to obtain a CCG-valued flow that describes the estimated obstacle evolution. However, since CCGs are defined indirectly - as an affine transformation of a generator set subject to equality constraints, rather than as a sublevel set of a scalar function - converting the estimated obstacle flows into CBFs is a nontrivial task. One of the main contributions of this paper is a procedure to perform this conversion, ultimately yielding a CBF via a convex optimization problem whose validity is established by the Implicit Function Theorem. The resulting obstacle-specific CBFs are then merged into a single CBF that is used to design a safe controller through the standard Quadratic Program (QP)-based approach. Since CCGs support Minkowski sums, the proposed framework also naturally handles rigid-body agents and generalizes existing CBF-based rigid-body navigation designs to arbitrary agent and obstacle geometries. While the main contribution is general, the paper primarily focuses on agents with first-order control-affine dynamics and second-order strict-feedback dynamics. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Matoušek, J. Krejčí, J. Duník, R. Zanetti</p>
            <p>This paper presents a practical and scalable grid-based state estimation method for high-dimensional models with invertible linear dynamics and with highly non-linear measurements, such as the nearly constant velocity model with measurements of e.g. altitude, bearing, and/or range. Unlike previous tensor decomposition-based approaches, which have largely remained at the proof-of-concept stage, the proposed method delivers an efficient and practical solution by exploiting decomposable model structure-specifically, block-diagonal dynamics and sparsely coupled measurement dimensions. The algorithm integrates a Lagrangian formulation for the time update and leverages low-rank tensor decompositions to compactly represent and effectively propagate state densities. This enables real-time estimation for models with large state dimension, significantly extending the practical reach of grid-based filters beyond their traditional low-dimensional use. Although demonstrated in the context of terrain-aided navigation, the method is applicable to a wide range of models with decomposable structure. The computational complexity and estimation accuracy depend on the specific structure of the model. All experiments are fully reproducible, with source code provided alongside this paper (GitHub link: this https URL).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lohitvel Gopikannan, Shashi Ranjan Kumar, Abhinav Sinha</p>
            <p>This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.</p>

            <p>Structural vibration testing plays a key role in aerospace engineering for evaluating dynamic behaviour, ensuring reliability and verifying structural integrity. These tests rely on accurate and robust data acquisition systems (DAQ) to capture high-quality acceleration data. However, commercial DAQs that provide the required performance and features are often expensive and complex, limiting their accessibility for small-scale research and experimental applications. This work presents the design and experimental validation of an affordable and in-house-developed acceleration DAQ, tested on a small fixed-wing UAV through several Taxi Vibration Test (TVT) runs and ambient vibration measurements. The proposed system integrates several OrangePi 3 LTS single-board computers with multiple LSM6DS3TR-C MEMS inertial measurement units operating simultaneously via an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication interface, managed under a Python-based master/slave architecture. Data is acquired at a stable sampling rate of approximately 208 Hz and post-processed using Welch's method to estimate their Power Spectral Density (PSD). Results confirm the system ability to provide consistent multi-sensor acceleration data and repeatable PSD profiles under the same test conditions; thus, demonstrating its reliability. With a total hardware cost below 600 EUR (approximately 690 USD), the developed DAQ offers a compact, scalable and cost-effective alternative for aerospace vibration analysis and structural testing.</p>

            <p>Video generation models have emerged as high-fidelity models of the physical world, capable of synthesizing high-quality videos capturing fine-grained interactions between agents and their environments conditioned on multi-modal user inputs. Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</p>

            <p>The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</p>

            <p>Extending large language models (LLMs) to the speech domain has recently gained significant attention. A typical approach connects a pretrained LLM with an audio encoder through a projection module and trains the resulting model on large-scale, task-specific instruction-tuning datasets. However, curating such instruction-tuning data for specific requirements is time-consuming, and models trained in this manner often generalize poorly to unseen tasks. In this work, we first formulate that the strongest generalization of a speech-LLM is achieved when it is trained with Self-Generated Instruction-Free Tuning (SIFT), in which supervision signals are generated by a frozen LLM using textual representations of speech as input. Our proposed SIFT paradigm eliminates the need for collecting task-specific question-answer pairs and yields the theoretically best generalization to unseen tasks. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce AZeroS (Auden Zero-instruction-tuned Speech-LLM), which is trained on speech-text pairs derived from publicly available corpora, including approximately 25,000 hours of speech with ASR transcripts and 3,000 hours of speech with paralinguistic labels. Built upon Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, the model updates only two lightweight projection modules (23.8 million parameters each), while keeping both the LLM and audio encoders frozen. Despite the minimal training cost and modest data scale, AZeroS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both semantic and paralinguistic benchmarks, including VoiceBench, AIR-Bench Foundation (Speech), and AIR-Bench Chat (Speech).</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models hold significant promise for universal Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, existing approaches often rely on end-to-end fine-tuning and exhibit limited efficacy under frozen-probing protocols, lacking the intrinsic universality required for broad generalization. This limitation stems from adapting general-purpose sequence architectures that overlook the biophysical and dynamical principles of neural activity. To bridge this gap, we propose DeeperBrain, a neuro-grounded foundation model integrating domain-specific inductive biases into its model design and learning objectives. Architecturally, DeeperBrain incorporates a volume conduction-aware channel encoding to model spatial mixing via 3D geometry, and a neurodynamics-aware temporal encoding capturing slow adaptations using oscillatory and exponential bases. For pretraining, we introduce a dual-objective strategy combining Masked EEG Reconstruction (MER) for local fidelity and Neurodynamics Statistics Prediction (NSP). NSP enforces alignment with macroscopic brain states by predicting interpretable order parameters, including spectral power, functional connectivity, cross-frequency coupling, and dynamic complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeeperBrain achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance under end-to-end fine-tuning. Crucially, it maintains superior efficacy under a rigorous frozen-probing protocol, verifying that embedding neuroscientific first principles endows learned representations with the intrinsic universality essential for universal BCI. The code will be publicly available.</p>

We derive theoretical upper bounds on approximation, generalization, and robustness under quantum noise, demonstrating that CL-QAS achieves controllable expressivity, sample-efficient generalization, and smooth convergence without barren plateaus. Empirical evaluations on electrocardiogram (ECG)-based signal classification and financial time-series forecasting confirm substantial improvements in accuracy, balanced accuracy, F1 score, and reward. CL-QAS maintains strong forward and backward transfer and exhibits bounded degradation under depolarizing and readout noise, highlighting its potential for adaptive, noise-resilient quantum learning on near-term devices.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.</p>

While my custom "MaxCRNN" (Inception + Bi-LSTM + Attention) achieved the highest safety (99% Precision) and robustness, I identify Random Forest (74% accuracy) as the Pareto-optimal solution for embedded control on legacy microcontrollers. I demonstrate that reliable, low-latency EMG control is feasible on commodity hardware, with Deep Learning offering a path to near-perfect reliability on modern Edge AI accelerators.</p>

            <h2>Digital Predistortion of Power Amplifiers for Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Jaeger, Bartosz Tegowski, Georg Frederik Riemschneider, Alexander Koelpin</p>
            <p>Power amplifiers (PA) are essential for microwavecontrolled trapped-ion and semiconductor spin based quantum computers (QC). They adjust the power level of the control signal and therefore the processing time of the QC. Their nonlinearities and memory effects degrade the signal quality and, thus, the fidelity of qubit gate operations. Driving the PA with a significant input power back-off reduces nonlinear effects but is neither power-efficient nor cost-effective. To overcome this limitation, this letter augments the conventional signal generation system applied in QCs by digital predistortion (DPD) to linearize the radio frequency (RF) channel. Numerical analysis of the qubit behavior based on measured representative control signals indicates that DPD improves its fidelity.</p>

            <h2>Visible Light Communication using Led-Based AR Markers for Robot Localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wataru Uemura, Shogo Kawasaki</p>
            <p>A method of information transmission using visual markers has been widely studied. In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker.</p>

            <h2>Non-volatile Programmable Photonic Integrated Circuits using Mechanically Latched MEMS: A System-Level Scheme Enabling Power-Connection-Free Operation Without Performance Compromise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ran Tao, Jifang Qiu, Zhimeng Liu, Hongxiang Guo, Yan Li, Jian Wu</p>
            <p>Programmable photonic integrated circuits (PPICs) offer a versatile platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a generic hardware mesh. However, the scalability of PPICs faces critical power consumption barriers. Therefore, we propose a novel non-volatile PPIC architecture utilizing MEMS with mechanical latching, enabling stable passive operation without any power connection once configured. To ensure practical applicability, we present a system-level solution including both this hardware innovation and an accompanying automatic error-resilient configuration algorithm. The algorithm compensates for the lack of continuous tunability inherent in the non-volatile hardware design, thereby enabling such new operational paradigm without compromising performance, and also ensuring robustness against fabrication errors. Functional simulations were performed to validate the proposed scheme by configuring five distinct functionalities of varying complexity, including a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a MZI lattice filter, a ring resonator (ORR), a double ORR ring-loaded MZI, and a triple ORR coupled resonator waveguide filter. The results demonstrate that our non-volatile scheme achieves performance equivalent to conventional PPICs. Robustness analysis was also conducted, and the results demonstrated that our scheme exhibits strong robustness against various fabrication errors. Furthermore, we explored the trade-off between the hardware design complexity of such non-volatile scheme and its performance. This study establishes a viable pathway to a new generation of power-connection-free PPICs, providing a practical and scalable solution for future photonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saleem Ishaq Tijjani, Bogdan Ghita, Nathan Clarke, Matthew Craven</p>
            <p>The detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs) remains a crucial challenge due to their stealthy, multistage nature and the limited availability of realistic, labeled datasets for systematic evaluation. Synthetic dataset generation has emerged as a practical approach for modeling APT campaigns; however, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive alert correlation mechanisms that limit scalability. Motivated by these limitations, this paper presents a near realistic synthetic APT dataset and an efficient alert correlation framework. The proposed approach introduces a machine learning based correlation module that employs K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering with a cosine similarity metric to group semantically related alerts within a temporal context. The dataset emulates multistage APT campaigns across campus and organizational network environments and captures a diverse set of fourteen distinct alert types, exceeding the coverage of commonly used synthetic APT datasets. In addition, explicit APT campaign states and alert to stage mappings are defined to enable flexible integration of new alert types and support stage aware analysis. A comprehensive statistical characterization of the dataset is provided to facilitate reproducibility and support APT stage predictions.</p>

            <h2>Water Demand Maximization: Quick Recovery of Nonlinear Physics Solutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sai Krishna Kanth Hari, Russell Bent</p>
            <p>Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.</p>

            <p>Understanding the structure of complex, nonstationary, high-dimensional time-evolving signals is a central challenge in scientific data analysis. In many domains, such as speech and biomedical signal processing, the ability to learn disentangled and interpretable representations is critical for uncovering latent generative mechanisms. Traditional approaches to unsupervised representation learning, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often struggle to capture the temporal and spectral diversity inherent in such data. Here we introduce variational decomposition autoencoding (VDA), a framework that extends VAEs by incorporating a strong structural bias toward signal decomposition. VDA is instantiated through variational decomposition autoencoders (DecVAEs), i.e., encoder-only neural networks that combine a signal decomposition model, a contrastive self-supervised task, and variational prior approximation to learn multiple latent subspaces aligned with time-frequency characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecVAEs on simulated data and three publicly available scientific datasets, spanning speech recognition, dysarthria severity evaluation, and emotional speech classification. Our results demonstrate that DecVAEs surpass state-of-the-art VAE-based methods in terms of disentanglement quality, generalization across tasks, and the interpretability of latent encodings. These findings suggest that decomposition-aware architectures can serve as robust tools for extracting structured representations from dynamic signals, with potential applications in clinical diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and adaptive neurotechnologies.</p>

            <h2>qAttCNN - Self Attention Mechanism for Video QoE Prediction in Encrypted Traffic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Sidorov, Ofer Hadar</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of multimedia consumption, driven by major advances in mobile devices since the mid-2000s, has led to widespread use of video conferencing applications (VCAs) such as Zoom and Google Meet, as well as instant messaging applications (IMAs) like WhatsApp and Telegram, which increasingly support video conferencing as a core feature. Many of these systems rely on the Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocol, enabling direct peer-to-peer media streaming without requiring a third-party server to relay data, reducing the latency and facilitating a real-time communication. Despite WebRTC's potential, adverse network conditions can degrade streaming quality and consequently reduce users' Quality of Experience (QoE). Maintaining high QoE therefore requires continuous monitoring and timely intervention when QoE begins to deteriorate. While content providers can often estimate QoE by directly comparing transmitted and received media, this task is significantly more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs). End-to-end encryption, commonly used by modern VCAs and IMAs, prevent ISPs from accessing the original media stream, leaving only Quality of Service (QoS) and routing information available. To address this limitation, we propose the QoE Attention Convolutional Neural Network (qAttCNN), a model that leverages packet size parameter of the traffic to infer two no-reference QoE metrics viz. BRISQUE and frames per second (FPS). We evaluate qAttCNN on a custom dataset collected from WhatsApp video calls and compare it against existing QoE models. Using mean absolute error percentage (MAEP), our approach achieves 2.14% error for BRISQUE and 7.39% for FPS prediction.</p>

            <p>Selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) is a novel approach capable of mitigating noise with varying frequency characteristics. It offers faster response and greater computational efficiency compared to traditional adaptive algorithms. However, spatial factors, particularly the influence of the noise source location, are often overlooked. Some existing studies have explored the impact of the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of the noise source on ANC performance, but they are mostly limited to free-field conditions and do not consider the more complex indoor reverberant environments. To address this gap, this paper proposes a learning-based directional SFANC method that incorporates the DoA of the noise source in reverberant environments. In this framework, multiple reference signals are processed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the azimuth and elevation angles of the noise source, as well as to identify the most appropriate control filter for effective noise cancellation. Compared to traditional adaptive algorithms, the proposed approach achieves superior noise reduction with shorter response times, even in the presence of reverberations.</p>

Neuromorphic computing is then applied to FPGA design for digital signal processing (DSP).

The results suggest that neuromorphic computing can provide low-latency and synaptic plasticity thereby enabling continuous on-chip learning. Due to their parallel and event-driven nature, neuromorphic computing can reduce power consumption by eliminating von Neumann bottlenecks and improve efficiency, but at the cost of reduced numeric precision.</p>

            <p>Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.</p>

            <p>The hardware-friendly implementation of transcendental functions remains a longstanding challenge in design automation. These functions, which cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations, pose significant complexity in digital circuit design. This study introduces a novel approach, TranSC, that utilizes stochastic computing (SC) for lightweight yet accurate implementation of transcendental functions. Building on established SC techniques, our method explores alternative random sources-specifically, quasi-random Van der Corput low-discrepancy (LD) sequences-instead of conventional pseudo-randomness. This shift enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of SC-based computations. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various function types, including trigonometric, hyperbolic, and activation functions. The proposed design approach significantly reduces MSE by up to 98% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions while reducing hardware area, power consumption, and energy usage by 33%, 72%, and 64%, respectively.</p>

            <p>Dictionary learning (DL) is a core tool in signal processing and machine learning for discovering sparse representations of data. In contrast with classical successes, there is currently no practical quantum dictionary learning algorithm. We argue that this absence stems from structural mismatches between classical DL formulations and the operational constraints of quantum computing. We identify the fundamental bottlenecks that prevent efficient quantum realization of classical DL and show how a structurally restricted model, doubly sparse dictionary learning (DSDL), naturally avoids these problems. We present a simple, hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on projection-based randomized Kaczmarz iterations with Qiskit-compatible quantum inner products. We outline practical considerations and share an open-source implementation at this https URL. The goal is not to claim exponential speedups, but to realign dictionary learning with the realities of near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

            <p>Smart contract technology facilitates self-executing agreements on the blockchain, eliminating dependency on an external trusted authority. However, smart contracts may expose vulnerabilities that can lead to financial losses and disruptions in decentralized applications. In this work, we evaluate deep learning-based approaches for vulnerability scanning of Ethereum smart contracts. We propose VASCOT, a Vulnerability Analyzer for Smart COntracts using Transformers, which performs sequential analysis of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode and incorporates a sliding window mechanism to overcome input length constraints. To assess VASCOT's detection efficacy, we construct a dataset of 16,469 verified Ethereum contracts deployed in 2022, and annotate it using trace analysis with concrete validation to mitigate false positives. VASCOT's performance is then compared against a state-of-the-art LSTM-based vulnerability detection model on both our dataset and an older public dataset.

            <p>Autonomous nano-drones, powered by vision-based tiny machine learning (TinyML) models, are a novel technology gaining momentum thanks to their broad applicability and pushing scientific advancement on resource-limited embedded systems. Their small form factor, i.e., a few 10s grams, severely limits their onboard computational resources to sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} microcontroller units (MCUs). The Bitcraze Crazyflie nano-drone is the \textit{de facto} standard, offering a rich set of programmable MCUs for low-level control, multi-core processing, and radio transmission. However, roboticists very often underutilize these onboard precious resources due to the absence of a simple yet efficient software layer capable of time-optimal pipelining of multi-buffer image acquisition, multi-core computation, intra-MCUs data exchange, and Wi-Fi streaming, leading to sub-optimal control performances. Our \textit{NanoCockpit} framework aims to fill this gap, increasing the throughput and minimizing the system's latency, while simplifying the developer experience through coroutine-based multi-tasking. In-field experiments on three real-world TinyML nanorobotics applications show our framework achieves ideal end-to-end latency, i.e. zero overhead due to serialized tasks, delivering quantifiable improvements in closed-loop control performance ($-$30\% mean position error, mission success rate increased from 40\% to 100\%).</p>

            <p>FR3 ($\approx$7-24 GHz), also referred to as the upper mid-band, has recently emerged as promising spectrum for 6G; however, its propagation and MIMO characteristics vary significantly with frequency and environment, and spectrum availability may be intermittent due to incumbents. Using site-specific ray tracing (Sionna RT) in representative indoor and outdoor scenarios, we evaluate 7, 10, 14, 20, and 24 GHz under SISO and MIMO configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies.</p>

            <p>Due to strict rate and reliability demands, wireless image transmission remains difficult for both classical layered designs and joint source-channel coding (JSCC), especially under low latency. Diffusion-based generative decoders can deliver strong perceptual quality by leveraging learned image priors, but iterative stochastic denoising leads to high decoding delay. To enable low-latency decoding, we propose a flow-matching (FM) generative decoder under a new land-then-transport (LTT) paradigm that tightly integrates the physical wireless channel into a continuous-time probability flow. For AWGN channels, we build a Gaussian smoothing path whose noise schedule indexes effective noise levels, and derive a closed-form teacher velocity field along this path. A neural-network student vector field is trained by conditional flow matching, yielding a deterministic, channel-aware ODE decoder with complexity linear in the number of ODE steps. At inference, it only needs an estimate of the effective noise variance to set the ODE starting time. We further show that Rayleigh fading and MIMO channels can be mapped, via linear MMSE equalization and singular-value-domain processing, to AWGN-equivalent channels with calibrated starting times. Therefore, the same probability path and trained velocity field can be reused for Rayleigh and MIMO without retraining. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and DIV2K over AWGN, Rayleigh, and MIMO demonstrate consistent gains over JPEG2000+LDPC, DeepJSCC, and diffusion-based baselines, while achieving good perceptual quality with only a few ODE steps. Overall, LTT provides a deterministic, physically interpretable, and computation-efficient framework for generative wireless image decoding across diverse channels.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyang Feng, Hanlin Sun, Yu Marco Nie, Jun Xie, Jiayang Li</p>
            <p>Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yonghan Li, Chenyu Wu, Taoran Wu, Shijie Wang, Bai Xue</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate the problem of verifying the finite-time safety of continuous-time perturbed deterministic systems represented by ordinary differential equations in the presence of measurable disturbances. Given a finite-time horizon, if the system is safe, it, starting from a compact initial set, will remain within an open and bounded safe region throughout the specified time horizon, regardless of the disturbances. The main contribution of this work is a converse theorem: we prove that a continuously differentiable, time-dependent barrier certificate exists if and only if the system is safe over the finite-time horizon. The existence problem is explored by finding a continuously differentiable approximation of a unique Lipschitz viscosity solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</p>

            <h2>Data-informativity conditions for structured linear systems with implications for dynamic networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul M.J. Van den Hof, Shengling Shi, Stefanie J.M. Fonken, Karthik R. Ramaswamy, Håkan Hjalmarsson, Arne G. Dankers</p>
            <p>When estimating a single subsystem (module) in a linear dynamic network with a prediction error method, a data-informativity condition needs to be satisfied for arriving at a consistent module estimate. This concerns a condition on input signals in the constructed, possibly MIMO (multiple input multiple output) predictor model being persistently exciting, which is typically guaranteed if the input spectrum is positive definite for a sufficient number of frequencies. Generically, the condition can be formulated as a path-based condition on the graph of the network model. The current condition has two elements of possible conservatism: (a) rather than focussing on the full MIMO model, one would like to be able to focus on consistently estimating the target module only, and (b) structural information, such as structural zero elements in the interconnection structure or known subsystems, should be taken into account. In this paper relaxed conditions for data-informativity are derived addressing these two issues, leading to relaxed path-based conditions on the network graph. This leads to experimental conditions that are less strict, i.e. require a smaller number of external excitation signals. Additionally, the new expressions for data-informativity in identification are shown to be closely related to earlier derived conditions for (generic) single module identifiability.</p>

            <h2>Memory-Efficient Training for Text-Dependent SV with Independent Pre-trained Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Ali Farokh, Hossein Zeinali</p>
            <p>This paper presents our submission to the Iranian division of the Text-Dependent Speaker Verification Challenge (TdSV) 2024. Conventional TdSV approaches typically jointly model speaker and linguistic features, requiring unsegmented inputs during training and incurring high computational costs. Additionally, these methods often fine-tune large-scale pre-trained speaker embedding models on the target domain dataset, which may compromise the pre-trained models' original ability to capture speaker-specific characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we employ a TdSV system that utilizes two pre-trained models independently and demonstrate that, by leveraging pre-trained models with targeted domain adaptation, competitive results can be achieved while avoiding the substantial computational costs associated with joint fine-tuning on unsegmented inputs in conventional approaches. Our best system reached a MinDCF of 0.0358 on the evaluation subset and secured first place in the challenge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Franziska Frigge, Lina Uggla, Elena Jiltsova, Markus Fahlström, Dag Nyholm, Alexander Medvedev</p>
            <p>Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings show that both the STN motor subdivision and STN motor streamlines are consistently engaged under clinical settings, while regions of avoidance receive minimal stimulation. Given these findings, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing anatomical constraints is demonstrated at the example of ten Parkinson's disease patients. The predicted settings were generally found to achieve higher target coverages while providing a better trade-off between maximizing target coverage and minimizing stimulation of regions associated with side effects. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</p>

            <p>The next generations of wireless networks are envisioned to integrate communications, sensing, and computing into a unified platform, demanding ultra-high data rates, submillisecond latency, and unprecedented energy efficiency. However, conventional digital processors face limitations in scalability, cost, and power consumption that hinder this vision. Wave computing, enabled by programmable metasurfaces, offers an alternative paradigm according to which signal processing operations are implemented in the domain of the propagation of electromagnetic waves. This approach transforms metasurfaces from passive wavefront shapers into functional analog processors capable of executing tasks such as beamforming, sensing, imaging, and machine learning at the speed of light with minimal power consumption. This article provides an overview of metasurface-enabled wave computing, highlighting its fundamental principles and key application scenarios for future wireless systems, including integrated sensing and communications, artificial intelligence acceleration, over-the-air channel estimation, and computational electromagnetic imaging. Future research directions are outlined in response to the major open challenges of the technology, aiming to enable large-scale deployment of wave computing in practical wireless networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Li, Bodong Shang, Qingqing Wu, Chao Ren</p>
            <p>This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</p>

            <h2>From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee</p>
            <p>Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. This adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where crucial textual capabilities like instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making it resource-intensive. To address these issues, previous works have leveraged the backbone LLMs to synthesize general-purpose, caption-style alignment data. In this paper, we propose a data generation framework that produces contrastive-like training data, designed to enhance ALLMs' ability to differentiate between present and absent sounds. We further extend our approach to multi-audio scenarios, enabling the model to either explain differences between audio inputs or produce unified captions that describe all inputs, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. We refer to the entire ALLM training framework as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance on audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks, as well as instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities. Overall, BALSa offers an efficient and scalable approach to developing ALLMs.</p>

            <p>We introduce ultrasound phase microscopy (UPM), a label-free imaging technique that breaks the diffraction limit using the intrinsic backscatter of red blood cells. By exploiting phase differences between consecutive frames beamformed with mismatched apodizations, UPM extracts sub-wavelength flow information without contrast enhancement. Comprehensive in vivo validation across three species (mouse, rat, rabbit) and three organ systems (brain, spinal cord, kidney) demonstrated spatial resolutions superior to 5 micrometers a tenfold improvement over conventional color flow imaging. Furthermore, UPM accelerates acquisition by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to localization microscopy. These results establish UPM as a robust, translatable approach for routine super-resolution microvascular screening in clinical diagnostics.</p>

            <p>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhi Yang, Omar Alhussein, Atefeh Arani, Zhaoyang Zhang, Mérouane Debbah</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference, achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems, generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models, we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.</p>

            <h2>Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruolin Du, Zhiqiang Wei, Zai Yang, Lei Yang, Yong Zeng, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jinhong Yuan</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyi Zhang, Yunlong Cai, Guanding Yu, Petar Popovski, Osvaldo Simeone</p>
            <p>In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios.</p>

            <p>Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive assessment models predict a single Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for speech, merging diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that estimates four orthogonal axes: Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness across speech, music, and environmental sounds. MMMOS fuses frame-level embeddings from three pretrained encoders (WavLM, MuQ, and M2D) and evaluates three aggregation strategies with four loss functions. By ensembling the top eight models, MMMOS shows a 20-30% reduction in mean squared error and a 4-5% increase in Kendall's {\tau} versus baseline, gains first place in six of eight Production Complexity metrics, and ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Cao, Zishuo Feng, Jicong Zhang, Wei Shi</p>
            <p>Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wen, Xiaoming Chen, Maojun Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Chongwen Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies, particularly massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave), introduces significant network complexity and computational demands. Significant research efforts have been made to improve physical layer performance by resorting to deep learning (DL) methods, which, however, are usually task-specific and struggle with data scarcity and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel In-Context Wireless Large Model (ICWLM), a wireless-native foundation model designed for simultaneous multi-task learning at the physical layer. Unlike conventional methods that adapt wireless data to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), ICWLM is trained directly on large-scale, mixed wireless datasets from scratch. It jointly solves multiple classical physical layer problems, including multi-user precoding (sum-rate maximization and max-min SINR) and channel prediction. A key innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL), enabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel conditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ICWLM achieves competitive performance compared to task-specific methods while exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities to unseen system configurations. This work offers a promising paradigm for developing unified and adaptive AI models for future wireless networks, potentially reducing deployment complexity and enhancing intelligent resource management.</p>

            <p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are rapidly becoming essential enablers of next-generation wireless systems, offering global broadband access, high-precision localization, and reliable sensing beyond terrestrial coverage. However, the inherent limitations of individual LEO satellites, including restricted power, limited antenna aperture, and constrained onboard processing, hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of 6G applications. To address these challenges, this article introduces the concept of distributed integrated sensing, localization, and communication (DISLAC) over LEO constellations, inspired by distributed multiple input multiple output architectures. By enabling inter-satellite cooperation through inter-satellite links, DISLAC jointly exploits communication, localization, and sensing functionalities, achieving synergistic gains in throughput, positioning accuracy, and sensing robustness through shared resources and cooperative design. We present illustrative case studies that quantify these benefits and analyze key system-level considerations, including synchronization, antenna reconfigurability, and inter-satellite link design. The article concludes by outlining open research directions to advance the practical deployment of DISLAC in future non-terrestrial networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tao Hong, Umberto Villa, Jeffrey A. Fessler</p>
            <p>Model-based reconstruction plays a key role in compressed sensing (CS) MRI, as it incorporates effective image regularizers to improve the quality of reconstruction. The Plug-and-Play and Regularization-by-Denoising frameworks leverage advanced denoisers (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers) and have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, their theoretical guarantees remain limited, as practical CNNs often violate key assumptions. In contrast, gradient-driven denoisers achieve competitive performance, and the required assumptions for theoretical analysis are easily satisfied. However, solving the associated optimization problem remains computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized Krylov subspace method (GKSM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Moreover, we also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for GKSM in nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with spiral and radial acquisitions validate both the computational efficiency of GKSM and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. The proposed optimization method is applicable to any linear inverse problem.</p>

            <p>High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), rapid bursts of brain activity above 80 Hz, have emerged as a highly specific biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. Recent evidence suggests that HFOs are also present in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), reflecting underlying network hyperexcitability and offering a promising, noninvasive tool for early diagnosis and disease tracking. This synoptic review provides a comprehensive analysis of publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) datasets relevant to HFO research in neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 1,222 articles, revealing a significant and growing research interest in HFOs, particularly within the last ten years. We then systematically profile and compare key public datasets, evaluating their participant cohorts, data acquisition parameters, and accessibility, with a specific focus on their technical suitability for HFO analysis. Our comparative synthesis highlights critical methodological heterogeneity across datasets, particularly in sampling frequency and recording paradigms, which poses challenges for cross-study validation, but also offers opportunities for robustness testing. By consolidating disparate information, clarifying nomenclature, and providing a detailed methodological framework, this review serves as a guide for researchers aiming to leverage public data to advance the role of HFOs as a cross-disease biomarker for AD and related conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannes Rosseel, Toon van Waterschoot</p>
            <p>Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic environments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible, acoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis requires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters that model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in concert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time, resulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the convolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant latency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In this paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based auralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the acoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A comparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated convolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time performance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system integrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU, creating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes processing latency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peihao Yan, Jie Lu, Huacheng Zeng, Y. Thomas Hou</p>
            <p>Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Source code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>While emotional text-to-speech (TTS) has made significant progress, most existing research remains limited to utterance-level emotional expression and fails to support word-level control. Achieving word-level expressive control poses fundamental challenges, primarily due to the complexity of modeling multi-emotion transitions and the scarcity of annotated datasets that capture intra-sentence emotional and prosodic variation. In this paper, we propose WeSCon, the first self-training framework that enables word-level control of both emotion and speaking rate in a pretrained zero-shot TTS model, without relying on datasets containing intra-sentence emotion or speed transitions. Our method introduces a transition-smoothing strategy and a dynamic speed control mechanism to guide the pretrained TTS model in performing word-level expressive synthesis through a multi-round inference process. To further simplify the inference, we incorporate a dynamic emotional attention bias mechanism and fine-tune the model via self-training, thereby activating its ability for word-level expressive control in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that WeSCon effectively overcomes data scarcity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in word-level emotional expression control while preserving the strong zero-shot synthesis capabilities of the original TTS model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jieming Ke, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper focuses on the privacy-preserving distributed estimation problem with a limited data rate, where the observations are the sensitive information. Specifically, a binary-valued quantizer-based privacy-preserving distributed estimation algorithm is developed, which improves the algorithm's privacy-preserving capability and simultaneously reduces the communication costs. The algorithm's privacy-preserving capability, measured by the Fisher information matrix, is dynamically enhanced over time. Notably, the Fisher information matrix of the output signals with respect to the sensitive information converges to zero at a polynomial rate, and the improvement in privacy brought by the quantizers is quantitatively characterized as a multiplicative effect. Regarding the communication costs, each sensor transmits only 1 bit of information to its neighbours at each time step. Additionally, the assumption on the negligible quantization error for real-valued messages is not required. While achieving the requirements of privacy preservation and reducing communication costs, the algorithm ensures that its estimates converge almost surely to the true value of the unknown parameter by establishing a co-design guideline for the time-varying privacy noises and step-sizes. A polynomial almost sure convergence rate is obtained, and then the trade-off between privacy and convergence rate is established. Numerical examples demonstrate the main results.</p>

            <h2>An Error-Based Safety Buffer for Safe Adaptive Control (Extended Version)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter A. Fisher, Johannes Autenrieb, Anuradha M. Annaswamy</p>
            <p>We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</p>

            <h2>Competent Discrete Time Modeling For analogue controlled PWM Converter Considering State-Feedback</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxin Yang, Hang Zhou, Hourong Song, Branislav Hredzak, Yingyi Yan</p>
            <p>Ever since this http URL proposed the state space averaging notion. The small signal model has been widely used as a design tool to tune control parameters. As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted. However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result this http URL.</p>

            <h2>Fast Collaborative Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ce Zheng, Ke Zhang, Chen Sun, Wenqi Zhang, Qiong Liu, Angesom Ataklity Tesfay</p>
            <p>Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a small draft model to predict multiple future tokens for verification by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this enables device-edge collaborative inference but introduces significant uplink overhead, as existing distributed speculative decoding schemes transmit full vocabulary logits at every step. We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability. Experiments show that TSLT significantly reduces uplink communication while maintaining end-to-end inference latency and model quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable, communication-efficient distributed LLM inference in future AI-RAN systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsin Iqbal Khan, Matti Hämäläinen, Timo J. Mäkelä, Erkki Harjula, Jani Katisko</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the feasibility of deploying private 5G networks in hospital environments, with a focus on the operating room at the brand new Oulu University Hospital, Finland. The study aims to evaluate the interference risk with other wireless systems, and electromagnetic safety of a private 5G network in the 3.9-4.1 GHz band, while ensuring compatibility with legacy wireless systems, such as LTE and Wi-Fi. We conducted a measurement campaign, employing state-of-the-art instrumentation and a methodology that combined high resolution and long-duration spectrum scans. The results demonstrate no measurable interference between the hospital's private 5G network with adjacent LTE (4G) or Wi-Fi bands, confirming the spectral isolation of the 5G transmissions, and vise versa. Additionally, RF exposure levels in the operating room were found to be well below ICNIRP, WHO, and IEEE safety thresholds, ensuring that the network poses negligible biological risk to patients and hospital staff. The study also proposes spectrum management strategies for private 5G networks in hospitals, focusing on adaptive sensing and guardband planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the integration of private 5G infrastructure in hospitals environments, supporting digital transformation in patient care without compromising electromagnetic compatibility or patient safety. The results also contribute to ongoing discussions around private 5G network deployments in sensitive sectors and provide actionable guidelines for future hospitals' wireless systems planning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariam Saeed, Manar Amr, Farida Adel, Nada Hassan, Nour Walid, Eman Mohamed, Mohamed Hussein, Marwan Torki</p>
            <p>Direct speech-to-image generation has recently shown promising results. However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Path Loss: Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Modeling for UAV Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Hossein Fahim Raouf, İsmail Güvenç</p>
            <p>This paper presents a measurement-based framework for characterizing altitude-dependent spectral behavior of signals received by a tethered Helikite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongyang Lv, Yanmei Jia, Yongqing Liu, Alan F. Lynch, Qing Zhao, Yuhu Wu</p>
            <p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. An inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Rivetti, Gabor Fodor, Emil Björnson, Mikael Skoglund</p>
            <p>The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Study on the Effectiveness of ASR Representations for Noise-Robust Speech Emotion Recognition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohan Shi, Jiajun He, Xingfeng Li, Tomoki Toda</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an efficient attempt to noisy speech emotion recognition (NSER). Conventional NSER approaches have proven effective in mitigating the impact of artificial noise sources, such as white Gaussian noise, but are limited to non-stationary noises in real-world environments due to their complexity and uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new method for NSER by adopting the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as a noise-robust feature extractor to eliminate non-vocal information in noisy speech. We first obtain intermediate layer information from the ASR model as a feature representation for emotional speech and then apply this representation for the downstream NSER task. Our experimental results show that 1) the proposed method achieves better NSER performance compared with the conventional noise reduction method, 2) outperforms self-supervised learning approaches, and 3) even outperforms text-based approaches using ASR transcription or the ground truth transcription of noisy speech.</p>

We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain.

We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</p>

            <p>In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains >90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</p>

            <p>How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.</p>

            <h2>Finite-Time Analysis of Simultaneous Double Q-learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyunjun Na, Donghwan Lee</p>
            <p>$Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite its widespread success in various applications, it is prone to overestimation bias in the $Q$-learning update. To address this issue, double $Q$-learning employs two independent $Q$-estimators which are randomly selected and updated during the learning process. This paper proposes a modified double $Q$-learning, called simultaneous double $Q$-learning (SDQ), with its finite-time analysis. SDQ eliminates the need for random selection between the two $Q$-estimators, and this modification allows us to analyze double $Q$-learning through the lens of a novel switching system framework facilitating efficient finite-time analysis. Empirical studies demonstrate that SDQ converges faster than double $Q$-learning while retaining the ability to mitigate the maximization bias. Finally, we derive a finite-time expected error bound for SDQ.</p>

            <p>Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) represent data features by learning the activation functions and demonstrate superior accuracy with fewer parameters, FLOPs, GPU memory usage (Memory), shorter training time (TraT), and testing time (TesT) when handling low-dimensional data. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, which contains significant redundant information, the current activation mechanism of KANs leads to unnecessary computations, thereby reducing computational efficiency. KANs require reshaping high-dimensional data into a one-dimensional tensor as input, which inevitably results in the loss of dimensional information. To address these limitations, we propose weighted activation distribution KANs (WKANs), which reduce the frequency of activations per node and distribute node information into different output nodes through weights to avoid extracting redundant information. Furthermore, we introduce a multilevel tensor splitting framework (MTSF), which decomposes high-dimensional data to extract features from each dimension independently and leverages tensor-parallel computation to significantly improve the computational efficiency of WKANs on high-dimensional data. In this paper, we design SpectralKAN for hyperspectral image change detection using the proposed MTSF. SpectralKAN demonstrates outstanding performance across five datasets, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.9801 and a Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.9514 on the Farmland dataset, with only 8 k parameters, 0.07 M FLOPs, 911 MB Memory, 13.26 S TraT, and 2.52 S TesT, underscoring its superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nian Wu, Jiarui Xing, Miaomiao Zhang</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>Audio deepfake detection is increasingly important as synthetic speech becomes more realistic and accessible. Recent methods, including those using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model frequency and temporal dependencies, show strong potential but need large amounts of labeled data, which limits their practical use. Label-efficient alternatives like graph-based non-contrastive learning offer a potential solution, as they can learn useful representations from unlabeled data without using negative samples. However, current graph non-contrastive approaches are built for single-view graph representations and cannot be directly used for audio, which has unique spectral and temporal structures. Bridging this gap requires dual-view graph modeling suited to audio signals. In this work, we introduce SIGNL (Spectral-temporal vIsion Graph Non-contrastive Learning), a label-efficient expert system for detecting audio deepfakes. SIGNL operates on the visual representation of audio, such as spectrograms or other time-frequency encodings, transforming them into spectral and temporal graphs for structured feature extraction. It then employs graph convolutional encoders to learn complementary frequency-time features, effectively capturing the unique characteristics of audio. These encoders are pre-trained using a non-contrastive self-supervised learning strategy on augmented graph pairs, enabling effective representation learning without labeled data. The resulting encoders are then fine-tuned on minimal labelled data for downstream deepfake detection. SIGNL achieves strong performance on multiple audio deepfake detection benchmarks, including 7.88% EER on ASVspoof 2021 DF and 3.95% EER on ASVspoof 5 using only 5% labeled data. It also generalizes well to unseen conditions, reaching 10.16% EER on the In-The-Wild dataset when trained on CFAD.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Integrating various modality encoders further expands their capabilities, giving rise to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that process not only text but also visual and auditory modality inputs. However, these advanced capabilities may also pose significant safety problems, as models can be exploited to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak attacks. While prior work has extensively explored how manipulating textual or visual modality inputs can circumvent safeguards in LLMs and MLLMs, the vulnerability of audio-specific jailbreak on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Jailbreak-AudioBench, which consists of the Toolbox, curated Dataset, and comprehensive Benchmark. The Toolbox supports not only text-to-audio conversion but also various editing techniques for injecting audio hidden semantics. The curated Dataset provides diverse explicit and implicit jailbreak audio examples in both original and edited forms. Utilizing this dataset, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art LALMs and establish the most comprehensive Jailbreak benchmark to date for audio modality. Finally, Jailbreak-AudioBench establishes a foundation for advancing future research on LALMs safety alignment by enabling the in-depth exposure of more powerful jailbreak threats, such as query-based audio editing, and by facilitating the development of effective defense mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Intelligence lies not only in the brain (decision-making processes) but in the body (physical morphology). The morphology of robots can significantly influence how they interact with the physical world, crucial for manipulating objects in real-life scenarios. Conventional robotic manipulation strategies mainly rely on finger-shaped end effectors. However, achieving stable grasps on fragile, deformable, irregularly shaped, or slippery objects is challenging due to difficulty in establishing stable forces or geometric constraints. Here, we present surface-based manipulation strategies that diverge from classical grasping approaches, using flat surfaces as minimalist end-effectors. By adjusting surfaces' position and orientation, objects can be translated, rotated, and flipped across the surface using closed-loop control strategies. Since this method does not rely on stable grasping, it can adapt to objects of various shapes, sizes, and stiffness levels and can even manipulate the shape of deformable objects. Our results provide a new perspective for solving complex manipulation problems.</p>

            <h2>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov</p>
            <p>Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</p>

            <p>Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.</p>

            <h2>Confidence-Based Self-Training for EMG-to-Speech: Leveraging Synthetic EMG for Robust Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodan Chen, Xiaoxue Gao, Mathias Quoy, Alexandre Pitti, Nancy F.Chen</p>
            <p>Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach, along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and speech recordings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuheng Zhang, Mengfei Duan, Kunyu Peng, Yuhang Wang, Ruiping Liu, Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Zhiyong Li, Kailun Yang</p>
            <p>3D semantic occupancy prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill dataset gaps, we propose a Realistic Anomaly Augmentation that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. Then, a novel framework that integrates OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, OccOoD, is proposed, which uses Cross-Space Semantic Refinement (CSSR) to refine semantic predictions from complementary voxel and BEV representations, improving OoD detection. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 65.50% and an AuPRCr of 31.83 within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive semantic occupancy prediction performance and generalization in real-world urban driving scenes.

            <p>Spoken language models (SLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, accompanied by a growing number of evaluation benchmarks. However, most existing benchmarks emphasize task completion and capability scaling, while remaining poorly aligned with how users interact with SLMs in real-world spoken conversations. Effective spoken interaction requires not only accurate understanding of user intent and content, but also the ability to respond with appropriate interactional strategies. In this paper, we present TELEVAL, a dynamic, user-centered benchmark for evaluating SLMs in realistic Chinese spoken interaction scenarios. TELEVAL consolidates evaluation into two core aspects. Reliable Content Fulfillment assesses whether models can comprehend spoken inputs and produce semantically correct responses. Interactional Appropriateness evaluates whether models act as socially capable interlocutors, requiring them not only to generate human-like, colloquial responses, but also to implicitly incorporate paralinguistic cues for natural interaction. Experiments reveal that, despite strong performance on semantic and knowledge-oriented tasks, current SLMs still struggle to produce natural and interactionally appropriate responses, highlighting the need for more interaction-faithful evaluation.</p>

            <p>Scene recognition is important for hearing devices, however; this is challenging, in part because of the limitations of existing datasets. Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or audiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine learning models. Deploying such models on resource-constrained edge devices presents another this http URL proposed solution is two-fold, a repack and refinement of several open source datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for auditory scene recognition for hearing devices, and introduce OpenYAMNet, a sound recognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available dataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model comparison. OpenYAMNet is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones connected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with hearing aid functionality, serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene recognition. OpenYAMNet achieved a mean average precision of 0.86 and accuracy of 0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories relevant to auditory scene recognition. Real-time sound-based scene recognition capabilities were demonstrated on edge devices by deploying OpenYAMNet to an Android smartphone. Even with a 2018 Google Pixel 3, a phone with modest specifications, the model processes audio with approximately 50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms per 1 second of audio.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Giacchi</p>
            <p>Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce Neighborhood Feature Pooling (NFP), a novel pooling layer designed to enhance texture-aware representation learning for remote sensing image classification. The proposed NFP layer captures relationships between neighboring spatial features by aggregating local similarity patterns across feature dimensions. Implemented using standard convolutional operations, NFP can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural network architectures with minimal additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets and backbone models demonstrate that NFP consistently improves classification performance compared to conventional pooling strategies, while maintaining computational efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of neighborhood-based feature aggregation for capturing discriminative texture information in remote sensing imagery.</p>

            <p>Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

            <p>Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

            <h2>PADE: A Predictor-Free Sparse Attention Accelerator via Unified Execution and Stage Fusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huizheng Wang, Hongbin Wang, Zichuan Wang, Zhiheng Yue, Yang Wang, Chao Li, Yang Hu, Shouyi Yin</p>
            <p>Attention-based models have revolutionized AI, but the quadratic cost of self-attention incurs severe computational and memory overhead. Sparse attention methods alleviate this by skipping low-relevance token pairs. However, current approaches lack practicality due to the heavy expense of added sparsity predictor, which severely drops their hardware efficiency. This paper advances the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by proposing a bit-serial enable stage-fusion (BSF) mechanism, which eliminates the need for a separate predictor. However, it faces key challenges: 1) Inaccurate bit-sliced sparsity speculation leads to incorrect pruning; 2) Hardware under-utilization due to fine-grained and imbalanced bit-level workloads. 3) Tiling difficulty caused by the row-wise dependency in sparsity pruning criteria. We propose PADE, a predictor-free algorithm-hardware co-design for dynamic sparse attention acceleration. PADE features three key innovations: 1) Bit-wise uncertainty interval-enabled guard filtering (BUI-GF) strategy to accurately identify trivial tokens during each bit round; 2) Bidirectional sparsity-based out-of-order execution (BS-OOE) to improve hardware utilization; 3) Interleaving-based sparsity-tiled attention (ISTA) to reduce both I/O and computational complexity. These techniques, combined with custom accelerator designs, enable practical sparsity acceleration without relying on an added sparsity predictor. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks show that PADE achieves 7.43x speed up and 31.1x higher energy efficiency than Nvidia H100 GPU. Compared to SOTA accelerators, PADE achieves 5.1x, 4.3x and 3.4x energy saving than Sanger, DOTA and SOFA.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuang Shi, Géraldine Morin, Simone Gasparini, Wei Tsang Ooi</p>
            <p>We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail. In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</p>

            <h2>How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Nyangon, Brecht Seifi</p>
            <p>The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.</p>

            <p>This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Shen, Zihan Guo, Ke Zuo, Wenqi Huang, Mingyang Sun</p>
            <p>Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.</p>

            <p>Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.</p>

            <p>Large-scale integration of distributed energy resources has led to a rapid increase in the number of controllable devices and a significant change in system dynamics. This has necessitating the shift towards more distributed and scalable control strategies to manage the increasing system complexity. In this work, we address the problem of partitioning a low-inertia power network into dynamically coherent subsystems to facilitate the utilization of distributed control schemes. We show that an embedding of the power network using the spectrum of the linearized synchronization dynamics matrix results in a natural decomposition of the network. We establish the connection between our approach and the broader framework of spectral clustering using the Laplacian matrix of the admittance network. The proposed method is demonstrated on the IEEE 30-bus test system, and numerical simulations show that the resulting clusters using our approach are dynamically coherent. We consider the robustness of the clusters identified in the network by analyzing the sensitivity of the small eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenspaces, which determines the coherency structure of the oscillator dynamics, to variations in the steady-state operating points of the network.</p>

In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.</p>

            <p>The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.</p>

            <h2>Definition and Formulation of Inertia Service Incorporating Inverter-Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sojin Park, Ross Baldick, Hunyoung Shin</p>
            <p>Increasing concerns over the scarcity of inertia have motivated the procurement of inertia as an ancillary service (AS). Despite numerous academic and practical efforts, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and treatment of inertia service in market operations, particularly the specification of inertia variables and the separation between synchronous inertia (SI) from synchronous generators and virtual inertia (VI) from inverter-based resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a power-oriented (P-oriented) definition based on inertial response, which establishes conceptual consistency between SI and VI and makes the inertia service commensurable with other ASs. This definition explicitly incorporates both positive and negative inertial responses during frequency drop events. We then formulate a security-constrained economic dispatch framework based on this P-oriented definition and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through simulations. Case studies on a modified IEEE 30-bus system show that the proposed bidirectional service definition ensures price signals that reflect the economic value of inertial provision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitraya Avadhut Desai, Ognjen Stanojev, Simon Muntwiler, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Small-signal stability of modern converter-dominated power systems has been the subject of extensive research, particularly from the perspective of device-level control design for grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) converters. However, the influence of power flow variables on system stability has received limited attention. Conventional small-signal stability analyses are typically conducted at a specific operating point, emphasizing the selection of control or system design parameters while neglecting the sensitivity of stability characteristics to operating conditions. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by systematically investigating the impact of dispatch decisions on the small-signal stability of converter-based power systems. Our findings are first illustrated on a three-bus system and then validated on the standard IEEE 39-bus test system to demonstrate scalability. Across the test systems, we find that high-voltage capacitive operation of GFL converters limits its active power injection, whereas inductive operation permits higher injections, and it is generally preferable for the GFM converter to supply more active power.</p>

Our results demonstrate that DistilBERT detects 97.6% of cyberattacks without compromising TCDR dependability and achieves inference latency below 6 ms on a commercial workstation. Additional evaluations confirm the framework's robustness under combined time-synchronization and false-data-injection attacks, resilience to measurement noise, and stability across prompt formulation variants. Furthermore, GPT-2 and DistilBERT+LoRA achieve comparable performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs for enhancing smart grid cybersecurity.

We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.</p>

            <h2>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jisoo Lee, Sunki Hong</p>
            <p>Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</p>

            <h2>Repeater Swarm-Assisted Cellular Systems: Interaction Stability and Performance Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianan Bai, Anubhab Chowdhury, Anders Hansson, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.</p>

            <h2>Battery-time-space fragment-based formulation for the Electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boshuai Zhao, Adam Abdin, Jakob Puchinger</p>
            <p>The Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP) optimizes routing and scheduling for electric autonomous vehicles to transport customers from origins to destinations. It features a combined objective that minimizes travel cost and excess user ride time, and allows partial recharging. Motivated by practical scenarios where time and battery data are available with limited precision, we introduce a discrete variant of the problem, termed D-E-ADARP, in which all time and battery parameters are discretized. This enables the development of our alternative solution approach: the discrete battery-time-space fragment-based formulation (BTSFF). In this framework, a fragment represents a subpath with an associated cost that accounts for both travel cost and excess user ride time. The BTSFF network integrates spatial, temporal, and battery dimensions, with the latter two discretized into finite indices. Computational results show that BTSFF solves D-E-ADARP significantly more efficiently than existing methods applied to the original E-ADARP. In addition, BTSFF efficiently provides high-quality lower bounds for E-ADARP and accelerates solving its battery swap variants. For E-ADARP, a relaxed network is constructed by rounding down travel times and battery consumptions, enabling a valid lower bound. For battery swap variants, BTSFF integrates lazy constraints via callbacks to correct time discretization errors, guaranteeing optimal solutions. Experiments show BTSFF outperforms benchmark methods in efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melek Tuylu, Eylem Erdogan</p>
            <p>High altitude platform station (HAPS) systems are becoming crucial facilitators for future wireless communication networks, enhancing connectivity across all vertical communication layers, including small Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices, terrestrial users, and aerial devices. In the context of the widely recognized vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture, HAPS systems can provide service to both aerial and ground users. However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Moreover, we explore the system in terms of throughput. The findings reveal that harnessing full potential of EH stands as a viable approach to meet the energy demands of HAPS systems.</p>

            <p>Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <h2>Cyberattack Detection in Virtualized Microgrids Using LightGBM and Knowledge-Distilled Classifiers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Osasumwen Cedric Ogiesoba-Eguakun, Suman Rath</p>
            <p>Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeyeon Park, Jiyu Lee, Junyeol Maeng, Shenghui Cui</p>
            <p>This paper presents a sub-switching period current-limiting control for a grid-tied inverter to prevent transient overcurrents during grid faults and enable seamless fault ride-through (FRT). Sudden grid-voltage disturbances, such as voltage sags or phase jumps, can induce large transient currents within a switching period, particularly at low switching frequencies. Upon disturbance detection, the proposed method immediately modifies the pulse-width modulation carrier, enabling continuous regulation of the inverter output current within a time much shorter than a switching period without interrupting current flow. The proposed method can be implemented on commonly used digital signal processors without requiring specialized analog or digital circuits or high-speed computing devices. Experimental results from a 2-level, 3-phase inverter switching at 3.6 kHz validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under symmetric and asymmetric voltage sags and phase jumps.</p>

            <h2>Accounting for Optimal Control in the Sizing of Isolated Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems Using Imitation Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Halvdansson, Lucas Ferreira Bernardino, Brage Rugstad Knudsen</p>
            <p>Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.</p>

            <h2>Multi-agent Optimization of Non-cooperative Multimodal Mobility Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Nafees Fuad Rafi, Zhaomiao Guo</p>
            <p>While multimodal mobility systems have the potential to bring many benefits to travelers, drivers, the environment, and traffic congestion, such systems typically involve multiple non-cooperative decision-makers who may selfishly optimize their own objectives without considering the overall system benefits. This paper aims to investigate market-based interactions of travelers and ride-sourcing drivers in the context of multimodal mobility systems. We propose a unified mathematical modeling framework to capture the decentralized travelers and drivers' decision-making process and balance the network's demand and supply by equilibrium pricing. Such a model allows analyses of the impact of decentralized decision-making on multimodal mobility efficiencies. The proposed formulation can be further convexified to efficiently compute the equilibrium ride-sourcing prices. We conduct numerical experiments on different settings of transportation networks to gain policy insights. We find that travelers prefer ride-sourcing and multimodal transportation more than the driving option when they are more sensitive to prices. We also find that travelers may need to be subsidized to use multimodal transportation when there is fewer transit hubs in the network or, ride-sourcing drivers become too sensitive to the prices. However, we find that more transit hubs in the network increases the total empty VMT of ride-sourcing drivers by increasing the total relocation time. The proposed model can be used by policymakers and platform operators to design pricing and subsidy schemes that align individual decision-making with system-level efficiency and evaluate the trade-offs between accessibility and environmental impacts in multimodal transportation networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Shi, Wei Xu, Yongming Huang, Jiacheng Yao, Wenhao Hu, Dongming Wang</p>
            <p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoqiao Chen, Xuewen Zhang, Minghao Han, Adrian Wing-Keung Law, Xunyuan Yin</p>
            <p>The real-time operation of open water systems is essential for ensuring operational safety, satisfying operational requirements, and optimizing energy usage. However, existing rule-based control strategies rely heavily on human experience, while model-based approaches depend on accurate hydrodynamic models, which limit their applicability to water systems with complex dynamics and uncertain disturbances. In this work, we develop a fully data-driven, zone-based control framework with adaptive control target zone selection for safe and energy-efficient operation of connected open water systems. Specifically, we propose a mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach that aims to maintain the water levels of the branches within the desired water-level zone while reducing real-time operational energy consumption. The DeePC-based approach enables direct use of input-output data for predictive control, eliminating the need for explicit dynamic modeling. To handle multiple control objectives with different priorities, we employ lexicographic optimization and reformulate the traditional DeePC cost function to incorporate zone tracking and energy consumption minimization objectives. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is utilized to determine the control target zone, which enables an effective trade-off between zone tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water levels within the desired water-level zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 hour. Compared to rule-based control method, the proposed method lowers zone-violation frequency by 74.96% and the average energy consumption by 22.44%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh Le, Phat K. Huynh, Om P. Yadav, Harun Pirim, Chau Le, Trung Q. Le</p>
            <p>Smart grid infrastructure needs improved resilience and preventive maintenance through more accurate predictions. Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework. The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction.</p>

            <p>Extreme events such as earthquakes pose significant threats to integrated electricity-gas distribution systems (IEGDS) by causing widespread damage. Existing restoration approaches typically assume full awareness of damage, which may not be true if monitoring and communication infrastructures are impaired. In such circumstances, field inspection is necessary. This paper presents a novel adaptive restoration framework for IEGDS, considering dynamic damage assessment and repair. The restoration problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the gradually revealed contingency and the evolving impact of field crew actions. To address the computational challenges of POMDPs in real-time applications, an advanced belief tree search (BTS) algorithm is introduced. This algorithm enables crew members to continuously update their actions based on evolving belief states, leveraging comprehensive simulations to evaluate potential future trajectories and identify optimal inspection and repair strategies. Based on the BTS algorithm, a unified real-time decision-making framework is developed for IEGDS restoration. Case studies on two distinct IEGDS systems demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an outage cost comparable to the ideal solution, and reduces the total outage cost by more than 15% compared to strategies based on stochastic programming and heuristic methods.</p>

            <p>Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are increasingly critical to power-system stability, yet their operation and maintenance remain dominated by reactive, expert-dependent diagnostics. While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems.</p>

            <p>Optimal power flow (OPF) is one of the fundamental tasks for power system operations. While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier. This work provides quantitative guidance for ML-OPF design and deployments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xueyun Long, Yueheng Li, Mario Pauli, Benjamin Nuss, Thomas Zwick</p>
            <p>Base station (BS) deployment remains a critical task with successive wireless communication generations and increasing data rates demands, while the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is often underrated, yielding potential health implications. Therefore, this paper proposes a workflow that adjusts BS deployment and radiated power in a 3D urban scenario to jointly consider EMF exposure and coverage. To achieve this ambition, firstly, a novel least-time shoot-and-bounce ray (SBR) ray-launching (RL) tool is developed to improve computational efficiency, and simultaneously enhance diffraction modeling} for accurate EMF exposure calculation, validated with real-world measurements. To efficiently extend the computation across the target urban area, the adaptive grid refinement (AGR) algorithm is designed based on the spatial stability of the effective channel while accounting for BS beamforming, enabling global estimation of EMF exposure and signal coverage. Subsequently, to better represent real-world communication network behaviors, the actual maximum transmit power, intercell interference, and channel state information imperfection are incorporated on the BS side, while mobility over the EMF exposure averaging interval is captured on the user equipment side. Upon the aforementioned aspects, the coverage-guaranteed EMF exposure minimization problem is formulated in a realistic and accurate manner, and solved by a geometry-aware algorithm adapted to deterministic channel models, yielding the optimal BS deployment and power configuration. In comparison to a baseline that relies on an empirical channel model, the proposed workflow delivers more reliable estimation of EMF exposure and provides practical guidance for BS construction and operations.</p>

            <p>This study examines long-term CO$_2$ emission trajectories across five major economies: Nigeria, the United States, China, Brazil, and Russia, by integrating national energy-mix characteristics with time-series forecasting models. Annual emissions from 2000-2023 were analyzed alongside energy production data to classify countries into fossil-dependent, transition-phase, or renewable-accelerated profiles. Three forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) were evaluated using MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R$^2$ metrics. Results show that Holt-Winters provided the most accurate forecasts for Nigeria, the United States, China, and Brazil, while SARIMA performed best for Russia due to its relatively stable emissions. Long-term projections from 2024 to 2060 indicate divergent decarbonization pathways. Brazil aligns most closely with a low-emission future owing to its renewable-dominant energy system, whereas Nigeria continues on an upward emissions trajectory driven by fossil dependence. The United States and China maintain moderate declines but require accelerated mitigation to reach their respective net-zero commitments. Russia's emissions remain largely flat under current conditions. These findings highlight the strong influence of energy structures on national decarbonization prospects and underscore the need for targeted energy policy reforms to align with global climate objectives.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a hybrid hydrogen electrolyzer-supercapacitor system (HESS) with a novel control strategy for renewable-dominant power grids. The HESS consists of alkaline electrolyzers (AEL), proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMEL), and supercapacitors (SC). The interfacing inverters between HESS and power grid are regulated by an inertia emulation control strategy. From HESS, AEL is with conventional DC power control, whereas PEMEL and SC are designed with the proposed dynamic inertia control and capacitive inertia control, respectively. Benefitting from the coordination of three controls, within the HESS, high-frequency transient power components are autonomously handled by SC, stable frequency power components are regulated by PEMEL, and low-frequency steady-state power is addressed by AEL, characterized by low operational gains and longer lifetimes. SC delivers transient power, significantly alleviating energy losses on electrolyzers and achieving adequate inertia recovery capabilities while requiring no additional communication. Implementing SOC recovery control enables the SC to withstand more than three times more stability discharge cycles compared to an SC without SOC recovery. Furthermore, a large-signal mathematical model based on mixed potential theory is established, providing clear stability boundaries for system parameters. Dynamic analyses theoretically verify system feasibility, and extensive hardware-in-the-loop experimental results fully validate the proposed HESS along with the corresponding transient power allocation controls.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Objective Operational Optimization of Energy Storage Systems in User-Side Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinzhou Xu, Yuanxin Zhuo, Paola Tapia</p>
            <p>An operational optimization strategy for microgrid energy storage systems (ESSs) is developed to address practical user-oriented application requirements, and its effectiveness is validated using real-world operational data. First, a fundamental ESS model is established to characterize system dynamics and operational constraints, providing a theoretical basis for optimization. Subsequently, a multi-objective operational optimization framework is formulated to simultaneously minimize electricity cost, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance renewable energy utilization. To ensure computational efficiency and scalability, the commercial optimization solver Gurobi is employed. The proposed strategy is evaluated using actual microgrid operational data, demonstrating that the developed ESS model accurately represents real system constraints. Compared with existing user operational strategies, the proposed approach achieves an average reduction of 13.47% in electricity cost. Moreover, by dynamically adjusting the weighting factors of the multi-objective formulation, the strategy enables flexible operational modes and significantly improves adaptability to varying operating scenarios. In addition, the proposed framework provides decision support for user-side microgrids participating in surplus electricity feed-in policies. The main contribution of this work lies in its user-centric optimization design, which enhances operational flexibility and scenario adaptability through multi-objective weight allocation, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world microgrid ESS operation.</p>

            <h2>A Survey on Applications of Quantum Computing for Unit Commitment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Ali Rajabi, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods. Key modeling strategies, hardware implementations, and computational trade-offs are discussed, highlighting the current progress, limitations, and potential future directions for large-scale quantum-enabled UC.</p>

            <h2>A Multi-Scale Attention-Based Attack Diagnosis Mechanism for Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks in Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao</p>
            <p>Parallel cyber--physical attacks (PCPA) can simultaneously damage physical transmission lines and disrupt measurement data transmission in power grids, severely impairing system situational awareness and attack diagnosis. This paper investigates the attack diagnosis problem for linearized AC/DC power flow models under PCPA, where physical attacks include not only line disconnections but also admittance modifications, such as those caused by compromised distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices. To address this challenge, we propose a learning-assisted attack diagnosis framework based on meta--mixed-integer programming (MMIP), which integrates a convolutional graph cross-attention attack localization (CGCA-AL) model. First, sufficient conditions for measurement reconstruction are derived, enabling the recovery of unknown measurements in attacked areas using available measurements and network topology information. Based on these conditions, the attack diagnosis problem is formulated as an MMIP model. The proposed CGCA-AL employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to predict a probability distribution over potential physical attack locations, which is incorporated into the MMIP as informative objective coefficients. By solving the resulting MMIP, both the locations and magnitudes of physical attacks are optimally estimated, and system states are subsequently reconstructed. Simulation results on IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed attack diagnosis framework under complex PCPA scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Towards a Multi-Layer Defence Framework for Securing Near-Real-Time Operations in Open RAN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Alimohammadi, Samara Mayhoub, Sotiris Chatzimiltis, Mohammad Shojafar, Muhammad Nasir Mumtaz Bhutta</p>
            <p>Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</p>

            <h2>Impact Assessment of Heterogeneous Grid Support Functions in Smart Inverter Deployments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Gokul Krishnan, Mohd. Asim Aftab, Nabil Mohammed, Shehab Ahmed, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The decarbonization of the energy sector has led to a significant high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.</p>

            <p>This study considers a point-to-point wireless link, in which both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains.</p>

            <p>Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled dual-scale channel estimation framework, where large-scale channel estimation benefits from sensing, and the temporal variation of small-scale channel state information is modeled via channel aging. By characterizing the impact of angular sensing error on the communication spatial correlation matrix, we derive a closed form expression for the achievable rate under dual-scale channel estimation errors. Considering the different characteristics in time scales, we design the sensing duration for slow-varying large-scale channel and determine the update timing and frequency for fast-varying small-scale channel information within a given frame structure. We formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem under limited time resources and sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints, and propose a segmented golden based joint optimization algorithm to efficiently solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes, which further validate that the system can leverage additional sensing capabilities to enhance communication efficiency.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sel Ly, Rufan Yang, Ninad Dixit, Hung Dinh Nguyen</p>
            <p>Lithium-ion batteries are the major type of battery used in a variety of everyday applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), mobile devices, and energy storage systems. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Voltage and Current Control Method for Harmonic Mitigation of Single-Phase AC Loads in DC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehdi Baharizadeh, Mohammad Sadegh Golsorkhi, Neda Keshavarzi, Thomas Ebel</p>
            <p>DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Zijun Chen, Haiwang Zhong, Di Cao, Guangchun Ruan</p>
            <p>In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</p>

            <p>With great flexibility to adjust antenna positions, pinching antennas (PAs) are promising for alleviating large-scale attenuation in wireless networks. In this work, we investigate the antenna positioning and beamforming (AP-BF) design in a multi-PA multi-user system under probabilistic light-of-sight (LoS) blockage and formulate a power minimization problem subject to per-user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For a single PA, we prove the convexity of the simplified problem and obtain its global optimum. For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya, Sajad Khodadadian, Taylan G. Topcu</p>
            <p>As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</p>

Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.</p>

            <h2>A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Zijun Chen, Haiwang Zhong, Di Cao, Guangchun Ruan</p>
            <p>In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Li, Yanqing Xu, Tenghao Cai, Tsung-Hui Chang</p>
            <p>With great flexibility to adjust antenna positions, pinching antennas (PAs) are promising for alleviating large-scale attenuation in wireless networks. In this work, we investigate the antenna positioning and beamforming (AP-BF) design in a multi-PA multi-user system under probabilistic light-of-sight (LoS) blockage and formulate a power minimization problem subject to per-user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For a single PA, we prove the convexity of the simplified problem and obtain its global optimum. For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.</p>

            <h2>Two-Stage Robust Optimal Operation of Distribution Networks Considering Renewable Energy and Demand Asymmetric Uncertainties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhisheng Xiong, Bo Zeng, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>This paper presents a confidence level-based distributionally information gap decision theory (CL-DIGDT) framework for the two-stage robust optimal operation of distribution networks, aiming at deriving an optimal operational scheme capable of addressing asymmetric uncertainties related to renewable energy and load demands. Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal</p>
            <p>Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya, Sajad Khodadadian, Taylan G. Topcu</p>
            <p>As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Svyatoslav Covanov, Cedric Pradalier</p>
            <p>This work extends a previous study that introduced an algorithm for state estimation on manifolds within the framework of the Kalman filter. Its objective is to address the limitations of the earlier approach. The reversible Kalman filter was designed to provide a methodology for evaluating the accuracy of existing Kalman filter variants with arbitrary precision on synthetic data. It has favorable numerical properties on synthetic data, achieving arbitrary precision without relying on the small-velocity assumption and depending only on sensor noise. However, its application to real data encountered difficulties related to measurement noise, which was mitigated using a heuristic. In particular, the heuristic involved an event detection step switching between reversible Kalman filter and classical Kalman variant at chosen moments. In the present work, we propose a study of this detection step and propose a methodology to prove at which moment the reversible Kalman approach improves on classical multiplicative variant. In particular, we propose a metric allowing one to discriminate situations in real-world scenarios where it behaves better than classical approach.</p>

            <h2>A Learning-Driven Stochastic Hybrid System Framework for Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Varmazyari, Masoud H. Nazari</p>
            <p>This paper presents a new learning based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) framework designed for the detection and classification of contingencies in modern power systems. Unlike conventional monitoring schemes, the proposed approach is capable of identifying unobservable events that remain hidden from standard sensing infrastructures, such as undetected protection system malfunctions. The framework operates by analyzing deviations in system outputs and behaviors, which are then categorized into three groups: physical, control, and measurement contingencies based on their impact on the SHS model. The SHS model integrates both system dynamics and observer-driven state estimation error dynamics. Within this architecture, machine learning classifiers are employed to achieve rapid and accurate categorization of contingencies. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE 5-bus and 30-bus systems, where results indicate substantial improvements in both detection speed and accuracy compared with existing approaches.</p>

Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions.

Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a cross-lingual dubbing system that translates speech from one language to another while preserving key characteristics such as duration, speaker identity, and speaking speed. Despite the strong translation quality of existing speech translation approaches, they often overlook the transfer of speech patterns, leading to mismatches with source speech and limiting their suitability for dubbing applications. To address this, we propose a discrete diffusion-based speech-to-unit translation model with explicit duration control, enabling time-aligned translation. We then synthesize speech based on the translated units and source speaker's identity using a conditional flow matching model. Additionally, we introduce a unit-based speed adaptation mechanism that guides the translation model to produce speech at a rate consistent with the source, without relying on any text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates natural and fluent translations that align with the original speech's duration and speaking pace, while achieving competitive translation performance.

            <h2>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Schildbach</p>
            <p>Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p>

            <h2>Combined Learning of Linear Parameter-Varying Models and Robust Control Invariant Sets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti, Alberto Bemporad</p>
            <p>Dynamical models identified from data are frequently employed in control system design. However, decoupling system identification from controller synthesis can result in situations where no suitable controller exists after a model has been identified. In this work, we introduce a novel control-oriented regularization in the identification procedure to ensure the existence of a controller that can enforce constraints on system variables robustly. The combined identification algorithm includes: (i) the concurrent learning of an uncertain model and a nominal model using an observer; (ii) a regularization term on the model parameters defined as the size of the largest robust control invariant set for the uncertain model. To make the learning problem tractable, we consider nonlinear models in quasi Linear Parameter-Varying (qLPV) form, utilizing a novel scheduling function parameterization that facilitates the derivation of an associated uncertain linear model. The robust control invariant set is represented as a polytope, and we adopt novel results from polytope geometry to derive the regularization function as the optimal value of a convex quadratic program. Additionally, we present new model-reduction approaches that exploit the chosen model structure. Numerical examples on classical identification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. A simple control scheme is also derived to provide an example of data-driven control of a constrained nonlinear system.</p>

            <h2>Re-Visible Dual-Domain Self-Supervised Deep Unfolding Network for MRI Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Qi Wang, Jian Sun, Zhijie Wen, Jun Shi, Shihui Ying</p>
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical practice, but suffered from prolonged acquisition time. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to accelerate acquisition and demonstrate promising performance, they rely on high-quality fully-sampled datasets for training in a supervised manner. However, such datasets are time-consuming and expensive-to-collect, which constrains their broader applications. On the other hand, self-supervised methods offer an alternative by enabling learning from under-sampled data alone, but most existing methods rely on further partitioned under-sampled k-space data as model's input for training, resulting in a loss of valuable information. Additionally, their models have not fully incorporated image priors, leading to degraded reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel re-visible dual-domain self-supervised deep unfolding network to address these issues when only under-sampled datasets are available. Specifically, by incorporating re-visible dual-domain loss, all under-sampled k-space data are utilized during training to mitigate information loss caused by further partitioning. This design enables the model to implicitly adapt to all under-sampled k-space data as input. Additionally, we design a deep unfolding network based on Chambolle and Pock Proximal Point Algorithm (DUN-CP-PPA) to achieve end-to-end reconstruction, incorporating imaging physics and image priors to guide the reconstruction process. By employing a Spatial-Frequency Feature Extraction (SFFE) block to capture global and local feature representation, we enhance the model's efficiency to learn comprehensive image priors. Experiments conducted on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hsien-Ching Chung</p>
            <p>Mountain huts are buildings located at high altitude, offering a place for hikers and providing shelter. Energy supply to mountain huts remains an ongoing issue. Using renewable energies could be an appropriate solution. Jiujiu Cabins, a famous mountain hut in Shei-Pa National Park, Taiwan, has operated an off-grid solar energy storage system (ESS) with lead-acid batteries. In 2021, a serious system failure took place, leading to no electricity. After a detailed on-site survey, a reorganization and repair project was implemented, and the energy system came back to operate normally. Meanwhile, an eco-friendly lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP battery) ESS replaces part of the lead-acid battery ESS, forming a hybrid ESS, making a better and greener off-grid solar ESS. In this case report, the energy architecture, detailed descriptions, and historical status of the system are provided. An on-site survey of the failed energy system, a system improvement project, and a future plan are listed.</p>

            <h2>Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Schildbach</p>
            <p>Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.</p>

            <h2>EcoNet: Multiagent Planning and Control Of Household Energy Resources Using Active Inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John C. Boik, Kobus Esterhuysen, Jacqueline B. Hynes, Axel Constant, Ines Hipolito, Mahault Albarracin, Alex B. Kiefer, Karl Friston</p>
            <p>Advances in automated systems afford new opportunities for intelligent management of energy at household, local area, and utility scales. Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) can play a role by optimizing the schedule and use of household energy devices and resources. One challenge is that the goals of a household can be complex and conflicting. For example, a household might wish to reduce energy costs and grid-associated greenhouse gas emissions, yet keep room temperatures comfortable. Another challenge is that an intelligent HEMS agent must make decisions under uncertainty. An agent must plan actions into the future, but weather and solar generation forecasts, for example, provide inherently uncertain estimates of future conditions. This paper introduces EcoNet, a Bayesian approach to household and neighborhood energy management that is based on active inference. The aim is to improve energy management and coordination, while accommodating uncertainties and taking into account potentially conditional and conflicting goals and preferences. Simulation results are presented and discussed.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Day Scheduling for Electric Vehicle Routing: A Novel Model and Comparison Of Metaheuristics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Köster, Florian Porkert, Klaus Volbert</p>
            <p>The increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) requires efficient route planning solutions that take into account the limited range of EVs and the associated charging times, as well as the different types of charging stations. In this work, we model and solve an electric vehicle routing problem (EVRP) designed for a cross-platform navigation system for individual transport. The aim is to provide users with an efficient route for their daily appointments and to reduce possible inconveniences caused by charging their EV. Based on these assumptions, we propose a multi-day model in the form of a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem that takes into account the vehicle's battery capacity and the time windows of user's appointments. The model is solved using various established metaheuristics, including tabu search (TS), adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), and ant colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the performance of the individual approaches is analyzed using generated ensembles to estimate their behavior in reality and is compared with the exact results of the Google OR-Tools solver.</p>

            <h2>An Equivalent and Unified Virtual Battery Modeling Framework for Flexibility Characterization of Building HVAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhu, Yu Yang, Liang Yu, Qing-Shan Jia, Costas J. Spanos, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>The heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system dominates building's energy consumption and meanwhile exhibits substantial operational flexibility that can be exploited for providing grid services. However, the goal is largely hindered by the difficulty to characterize the system's operating flexibility due to the complex building thermal dynamics, system operating limits and human comfort constraints. To address this challenge, this paper develops an unified virtual battery (VB) modeling framework for characterizing the operating flexibility of both single-zone and multi-zone building HVAC systems, enabling flexible buildings to function like virtual batteries. Specifically, a physically meaningful representation state is first identified to represent building thermal conditions under thermal comfort constraints and a VB model is then established for characterizing the operating flexibility of single-zone HVAC systems. We subsequently extend the VB modeling framework to multi-zone HVAC systems and establish a set of zone-level VB models to characterize the building's zonal operating flexibility. We further develop a systematic method to aggregate the VB models into a low-order and low-complexity aggregated VB model, significantly reducing model and computational complexity. We demonstrate the VB model through demand response (DR) applications and conclude that the VB model can well capture the operating flexibility of building HVAC systems and enable effective DR participation. The DR strategies obtained from the VB model can be efficiently decomposed to zone-level control inputs for maintaining human thermal comfort while achieving near-optimal operation cost.</p>

            <h2>Economic and Reliability Value of Improved Offshore Wind Forecasting in Bulk Power Grid Operation: A Case Study of The New York Power Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khaled Bin Walid, Feng Ye, Jiaxiang Ji, Ahmed Aziz Ezzat, Travis Miles, Yazhou Leo Jiang</p>
            <p>This study investigates the economic and reliability benefits of improved offshore wind forecasting for grid operations along the U.S. East Coast. We introduce and evaluate a state-of-the-art, machine-learning-based offshore wind forecasting model tailored for this region by integrating its improved forecasts into a dynamic reserve procurement framework aligned with New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) practices to evaluate their economic value. To determine system-wide reserve needs, plant-specific reserves are aggregated. However, conventional methods overlook spatial correlation across sites, often leading to over procurement. To address this, we propose a risk-based reserve aggregation technique that leverages spatial diversification. Additionally, we evaluate the reliability improvements enabled by the enhanced offshore wind forecast. To evaluate the operational impact, we propose an operational resource adequacy framework that captures uncertainty from forecast errors and grid conditions. Using this framework, we quantify key reliability metrics under different offshore wind forecast scenarios. Using New York State as a case study, we find that the improved forecast enables more accurate reserve estimation, reducing procurement costs by 5.53% in 2035 scenario compared to a well-validated numerical weather prediction model. Applying the risk-based aggregation further reduces total production costs by 7.21%. From a reliability perspective, the improved forecasts lower the system Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) by approximately 19% in the 2035 scenario, highlighting its potential to enhance system reliability during real-time grid operations.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Placement of Data Centers to Support Power Distribution Networks Using Intelligent Algorithms with Economic Indicators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Hajihasani, Mahmoud Modaresi</p>
            <p>Data centers are among the fastest growing electricity consumers and can impose severe voltage drops and feeder losses when connected to weak distribution networks. This paper formulates a techno economic siting problem in which each candidate data center site is mapped to a bus of the distribution network and is assumed to deploy on site renewable generation and power electronic interfaces, resulting in a controllable net active power injection equivalent to distributed generation. A mixed integer nonlinear optimization model is developed to jointly select the connection bus and size the DG capacity while respecting network operating limits. The objective combines three normalized terms including active power losses, a voltage deviation index capturing profile quality, and investment cost derived from location dependent land price and unit DG cost. To address the discrete continuous search space, an intelligent genetic algorithm is embedded in a multi scenario decision framework with adaptive weight tuning. Three stakeholder scenarios prioritize losses, voltage quality, or techno economic balance, and additional balanced scenarios are generated automatically until the optimal bus decision converges. A case study on the IEEE 33 bus radial system demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach. The converged design selects bus 14 with 1.10 MW DG, reducing total losses from 202.67 kW to 129.37 kW while improving the minimum bus voltage to 0.933 per unit at a moderate investment cost of 1.33 MUSD. The proposed framework provides an interpretable pathway to integrate economic indicators into distribution aware data center siting.</p>

            <p>This article presents a study on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems using low-cost pyranometer sensors.

The strategy was implemented in the local control of a Cuk converter and experimentally validated against the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based technique, leveraging affordable sensor technology, achieves accurate MPPT performance with reduced fluctuations, enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of PV tracking systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hritik Gopal Shah, Catherine Tajmajer, Elli Ntakou</p>
            <p>Natural disasters often inflict severe damage on distribution grids. Rapid, reliable damage assessment (DA) is essential for storm restoration, yet most optimization work targets repair dispatch after faults are identified. This paper presents a production, rolling horizon DA crew allocation system deployed across multiple U.S. states in Eversource Energy's service territory and used during live storms. The method implements a sequential k-job assignment policy per available crew, executed on a fixed cadence and on operators' control. The objective jointly prioritizes critical facilities and customer impact while controlling travel time on the actual road network via the Google Maps API. A key constraint is the absence of live crew GPS; we infer crew locations from the last confirmed DA site and robustify travel estimates for staleness, yielding stable recommendations without continuous tracking. The operator remains in the loop with controls to limit churn and to publish a feasible plan. Using data from the March 7 New Hampshire storm with 90 moderate outages and seven DA crews, we observe shorter time to first assessment, fewer revisits with reduced distance traveled. To our knowledge, this is among the first multi-state enterprise integrated deployments to treat DA crews as a first-class optimized resource in storm restoration.</p>

            <p>The growing complexity of power system operations has created an urgent need for intelligent, automated tools to support reliable and efficient grid management. Conventional analysis tools often require significant domain expertise and manual effort, which limits their accessibility and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper presents X-GridAgent, a novel large language model (LLM)-powered agentic AI system designed to automate complex power system analysis through natural language queries. The system integrates domain-specific tools and specialized databases under a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising planning, coordination, and action layers. This architecture offers high flexibility and adaptability to previously unseen tasks, while providing a modular and extensible framework that can be readily expanded to incorporate new tools, data sources, or analytical capabilities. To further enhance performance, we introduce two novel algorithms: (1) LLM-driven prompt refinement with human feedback, and (2) schema-adaptive hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate information retrieval from large-scale structured grid datasets. Experimental evaluations across a variety of user queries and power grid cases demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of X-GridAgent in automating interpretable and rigorous power system analysis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Honghui Zheng, Pietro Favaro, Yury Dvorkin, Ján Drgoňa</p>
            <p>Underground pumped hydro energy storage (UPHES) systems play a critical role in grid-scale energy storage for renewable integration, yet optimal day-ahead scheduling remains computationally prohibitive due to nonlinear turbine performance characteristics and discrete operational modes. This paper presents a decision-focused learning (DFL) framework that addresses the computational-accuracy trade-off in UPHES day-ahead scheduling. The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark. Thus, the presented DFL framework enables flexible prioritization between profit maximization and real-time responsiveness.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Grid Resilience for Giga-Watt Scale Data Centers Using High Voltage Circuit Breaker Operated Braking Resistors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain Sadi</p>
            <p>As hyperscale and co-located data centers scale, the electric grid sees an increase in large, voltage-sensitive IT loads with these data center plant size ranging between 500 MW to 2 GW. A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers. The approach integrates with protection, needs no generator changes, and can be scaled with cluster size or growth of the data center facility load.</p>

            <p>This paper studies precoder design for secure MIMO integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by introducing the MIMO-ME-MS channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter serves a legitimate multi-antenna receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper while simultaneously enabling sensing via a multi-antenna sensing receiver. Using sensing mutual information as the sensing metric, we formulate a nonconvex weighted objective that jointly captures secure communication (via secrecy rate) and sensing performance. A high-SNR analysis based on subspace decomposition characterizes the maximum achievable weighted degrees of freedom and reveals that a quasi-optimal precoder must span a "useful subspace," highlighting why straightforward extensions of classical wiretap/ISAC precoders can be suboptimal in this tripartite setting. Motivated by these insights, we develop a practical two-stage iterative algorithm that alternates between sequential basis construction and power allocation via a difference-of-convex program. Numerical results show that the proposed approach captures the desirable precoding structure predicted by the analysis and yields substantial gains in the MIMO-ME-MS channel.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for uplink pinching antenna system (PASS). Our objective is to maximize the uplink sum rate by jointly optimizing a continuous antenna positioning and user's transmission power. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and difficult to solve directly; to address this challenge, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) framework which decomposes the original problem into two tractable sub-problems, namely (i) power allocation optimization sub-problem and (ii) antenna position optimization sub-problem. Both sub-problems are solved using successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm and solved alternatively until convergence. The RSMA access for PASS is compared with conventional non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The performance of discrete antenna activation with PASS strategy is also examined. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the achievable sum rate compared to other multiple access methods.</p>

            <h2>Robust and Secure Transmission for Movable-RIS Assisted ISAC with Imperfect Sense Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ling Zhuang, Ximing Xie, Fang Fang, Ali Attaran, Zhizhong Zhang</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface.</p>

            <p>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems enable cellular networks to jointly operate as communication technology and sense the environment. While opportunities and potential performance have been largely investigated in simulations, few experimental works have showcased Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) effectiveness in a real-world deployment based on cellular radio units. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an initial study investigating the feasibility of ATR for ISAC. Our ATR solution uses a Deep Learning (DL)-based detector to infer the target class directly from the radar images generated by the ISAC system. The DL detector is evaluated with experimental data from a ISAC testbed based on commercially available mmWave radio units in the ARENA 2036 industrial research campus located in Stuttgart, Germany. Experimental results demonstrate accurate classification performance, demonstrating the feasibility of ATR ISAC with cellular hardware in our setup. We finally provide insights about the open generalization challenges, that will fuel future work on the topic.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Songnan Gu, Hao Jiang, Chongjun Ouyang, Yuanwei Liu, Dong In Kim</p>
            <p>A multiuser uplink transmission framework based on the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed under two operating protocols: segment selection (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). For each protocol, the achievable uplink sum-rate is characterized for both time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Low-complexity placement methods for the pinching antennas (PAs) are developed for both protocols and for both multiple-access schemes. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and show that SWAN achieves higher sum-rate performance than conventional pinching-antenna systems, while SA provides additional performance gains over SS.</p>

            <p>Most current assessments use ex post proxies that miss uncertainty and fail to consistently capture the rapid change in bitcoin mining. We introduce a unified, ex ante statistical model that derives expected return, downside risk, and upside potential profit from the first principles of mining: Each hash is a Bernoulli trial with a Bitcoin block difficulty-based success probability. The model yields closed-form expected revenue per hash-rate unit, risk metrics in different scenarios, and upside-profit probabilities for different fleet sizes. Empirical calibration closely matches previously reported observations, yielding a unified, faithful quantification across hardware, pools, and operating conditions. This foundation enables more reliable analysis of mining impacts and behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Christos Masouros, Lajos Hanzo</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extend the coverage but yield marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Roh, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</p>

Two key aspects are examined: the dependence of the DBD electrical model on reactor geometry, and application-driven requirements for injected waveform characteristics, including shapes, voltage amplitude, frequency, and modulation techniques. On this basis, the paper systematically reviews two major categories of power supplies: sinusoidal types comprising transformerless and transformer-based resonant inverters, and pulsed power supplies (PPSs).

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Deakin, Rahmat Heidari, Xu Deng</p>
            <p>The mitigation of unbalanced grid voltages or currents by voltage source converters results in power ripple on the dc link, and is a key converter design parameter due to hardware or stability considerations. Despite the importance of this issue for system design and operation, the use of Optimal Power Flow (OPF)-based methods capturing the interaction between dc link ripple and converter unbalanced operation has been largely unexplored. In this work, the magnitude of the power ripple is derived for generic multi-terminal converters, then introduced as a bilinear OPF constraint for two-level converter topologies. OPF case studies demonstrate the necessity to model both neutral current and dc link ripple, with tradeoffs between capacitor sizing and leg sizing highlighted for phase current unbalance mitigation applications. Time domain simulations of a grid-connected four-wire voltage source converter verify the accuracy and validity of the algebraic formulation. It is concluded that awareness of dc link ripple impacts and constraints will be of growing importance for distribution system operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karan Mukhi, Licio Romao, Alessandro Abate</p>
            <p>We study optimal charging of large electric vehicle populations that are exposed to a single real-time imbalance price. The problem is naturally cast as a multistage stochastic linear programme (MSLP), which can be solved by algorithms such as Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming. However, these methods scale poorly with the number of devices and stages. This paper presents a novel approach to overcome this curse of dimensionality. Building prior work that characterises the aggregate flexibility sets of populations of EVs as a permutahdron, we reformulate the original problem in terms of aggregated quantities. The geometric structure of permutahedra lets us (i) construct an optimal disaggregation policy, (ii) derive an exact, lower-dimensional MSLP, and (iii) characterise the expected recourse function as piecewise affine with a finite, explicit partition. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the slopes and intercepts of each affine region via truncated expectations of future prices, yielding an exact form for the recourse function and first-stage policy. Comprehensive numerical studies validate our claims and demonstrate the practical utility of this work.</p>

            <h2>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gokul Puthumanaillam, Paulo Padrao, Jose Fuentes, Leonardo Bobadilla, Melkior Ornik</p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semih Cayci</p>
            <p>In this work, we establish non-asymptotic convergence bounds for the Gauss-Newton method in training neural networks with smooth activations. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow in parameter space induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional embedded submanifold of the function space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we establish geodesic Polyak-Lojasiewicz and Lipschitz-smoothness conditions for the loss under appropriately chosen output scaling, yielding geometric convergence to the optimal in-class predictor at an explicit rate independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix. In the overparameterized regime, we propose adaptive, curvature-aware regularization schedules that ensure fast geometric convergence to a global optimum at a rate independent of the minimum eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel and, locally, of the modulus of strong convexity of the loss. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Newton achieves accelerated convergence rates in settings where first-order methods exhibit slow convergence due to ill-conditioned kernel matrices and loss landscapes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ningwei Bai, Chi Pui Chan, Qichen Yin, Tengyang Gong, Yunda Yan, Zezhi Tang</p>
            <p>This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faisal Ahmed</p>
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the subtle structural variations in brain MRI scans often pose challenges for conventional deep learning models to extract discriminative features effectively. In this work, we propose PseudoColorViT-Alz, a colormap-enhanced Vision Transformer framework designed to leverage pseudo-color representations of MRI images for improved Alzheimer's disease classification. By combining colormap transformations with the global feature learning capabilities of Vision Transformers, our method amplifies anatomical texture and contrast cues that are otherwise subdued in standard grayscale MRI scans. We evaluate PseudoColorViT-Alz on the OASIS-1 dataset using a four-class classification setup (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild dementia, and very mild dementia). Our model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.79% with an AUC of 100%, surpassing the performance of recent 2024--2025 methods, including CNN-based and Siamese-network approaches, which reported accuracies ranging from 96.1% to 99.68%. These results demonstrate that pseudo-color augmentation combined with Vision Transformers can significantly enhance MRI-based Alzheimer's disease classification. PseudoColorViT-Alz offers a robust and interpretable framework that outperforms current methods, providing a promising tool to support clinical decision-making and early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <h2>Cooperative Energy Scheduling of Multi-Microgrids Based on Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</h2>

            <p>With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy, multi-microgrids play an increasingly important role in improving the flexibility and reliability of energy supply. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance.</p>

            <h2>Dispatch-Aware Learning for Optimal Transmission Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Andy Sun, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability and generalization ability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerard Marias Gonzalez, Alejandro Pena-Bello, Jérémy Dumoulin, Nicolas Wyrsch</p>
            <p>Local Electricity Communities (communautés électriques locales, CEL) will become operational in Switzerland in 2026, allowing prosumers, consumers, and storage operators within the same municipality and distribution system operator (DSO) area to exchange electricity over the public grid with reduced distribution tariffs. This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement.</p>

            <p>Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage, especially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted large-scale networks remain open issues. This paper proposes a stochastic geometry (SG) based framework to characterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios. Particularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of RISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power control mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed framework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in downlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided. Additionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a user to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient identification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs. From numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the downlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved SINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS deployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE compliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics through joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in improving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can contribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between coverage and compliance when deploying RISs.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of time-varying constant power loads. Modelling the load demand as a constantly evolving unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, \ie uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. By adopting a suitable control barrier function, we formulate a continuous-time control law and derive analytic conditions on the tuning parameters, such that the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories is bounded. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated both via simulation and real-time HIL scenarios, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.</p>

Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.</p>

The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <h2>Optimal chiller loading including transients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel R. Arahal, Manuel G. Satué, Manuel G. Ortega</p>
            <p>Scheduling and loading of chillers in a multi-chiller plant is considered. A new framework is introduced considering an extended set of independent variables for the optimization problem of energy consumption. In this way the number of decision variables is increased, providing extra degrees of freedom to optimize cooling plant operation. The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation solution is deployed for the problem and the proposed method is compared with a similar but static approach showing the benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption.</p>

            <h2>Economic versus energetic model predictive control of a cold production plant with thermal energy storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel G. Satué, Manuel R. Arahal, Luis F. Acedo, Manuel G. Ortega</p>
            <p>Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.</p>

            <h2>A Context-Free Smart Grid Model Using Complex System Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soufian Ben Amor, Alain Bui, Guillaume Guerard</p>
            <p>Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christos N. Efrem, Ioannis Krikidis</p>
            <p>We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&B has low computational complexity on average.</p>

            <h2>Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grigory Neustroev, Diego A. Tejada-Arango, German Morales-Espana, Mathijs M. de Weerdt</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose the method of hull clustering with blended RPs to enhance traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), approximating the full time horizon more accurately and with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Assessing the Frequency Response Potential of Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicles with Vehicle-to-Grid Integration in the California Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Tao, Yaoyu Fan, Zhaoyi Ye, Rajit Gadh</p>
            <p>The integration of heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capability can enhance primary frequency response and improve stability in power systems with high renewable penetration. This study evaluates the technical potential of heavy-duty EV fleets to support the California power grid under three practical charging strategies: immediate charging, delayed charging, and constant-minimum-power charging. We develop a simulation framework that couples aggregated frequency dynamics with battery and charger constraints, state-of-charge management, and fleet-availability profiles. Performance is assessed using standard frequency security metrics, including nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, overshoot, and settling time, across credible contingency scenarios and renewable generation conditions. Results indicate that both non-V2G modes and V2G-enabled operation can contribute meaningful primary response, with V2G providing the strongest and fastest support while respecting mobility and network limits. Sensitivity analyses show that the relative benefits depend on charging strategy, control parameters, and renewable output, highlighting design trade-offs between response magnitude, duration, and battery usage. Overall, heavy-duty EV fleets-when coordinated by appropriate charging and V2G controls-offer a viable resource for strengthening primary frequency control on the California grid and mitigating stability challenges associated with increasing renewable penetration.</p>

            <p>This letter presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for joint time allocation and power control in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT).

The joint optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process under small-scale fading, realistic EH, and interference constraints.

            <p>The increasing electrification of human activities and the rapid integration of variable renewable energy sources strain the power grid. A solution to address the need for more grid storage is to use the battery of electric vehicles as a back-up capacity. However, drivers tend to disconnect their electric vehicle when its battery is needed the most. We propose a charge scheduler that incentivizes drivers to delay their disconnection to improve vehicle-to-grid services. We also leverage drivers' temporal flexibility to alleviate congestion in oversubscribed charging stations. We formulate the computation of an optimal flexible schedule as a mixed-integer quadratic problem. We tractably approximate its solution using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Considering the possibility that strategic drivers misreport their charging preferences to the station coordinator, we then propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism that incentivizes truthful reporting. We conclude with a simulated case study using real-world data to quantitatively assess the added value of drivers' temporal flexibility for enhancing vehicle-to-grid services and reducing station congestion.</p>

            <h2>Service-Oriented Fast Frequency Response from Flexible Loads and Energy Storage in Low-Inertia Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable generation has significantly reduced system inertia, making modern power grids more vulnerable to rapid frequency deviations following disturbances. While a wide range of flexible resources-including electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-have demonstrated the physical capability to provide fast frequency response (FFR), existing studies primarily focus on individual resource performance or controller-level designs. A systematic framework that translates heterogeneous FFR capabilities into deployable, system-level frequency services remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a service-oriented coordination framework for fast frequency response from flexible loads and energy storage, bridging the gap between physical capability assessment and grid-operational utilization. The framework decomposes frequency support into multiple time-critical service layers based on response speed, power capacity, and energy sustainability, and dynamically allocates FFR responsibilities among heterogeneous resources accordingly. By explicitly accounting for response latency, saturation limits, and energy constraints, the proposed approach enables coordinated dispatch that prioritizes ultra-fast resources for initial frequency arrest while leveraging slower but energy-rich resources to sustain recovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Golgol, Anamitra Pal, Vijay Vittal, Christine Fini, Ernest Palomino, Kyle Girardi</p>
            <p>The installation of high-capacity fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) is posing a significant risk to the distribution grid as the increased demand from widespread residential EV charging could exceed the technical limits of the distribution system. Addressing this issue is critical, given that current infrastructure upgrades to enhance EV hosting capacity are both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the inherent uncertainties associated with EV charging parameters make it challenging for power utilities to accurately assess the impact of EVs added to specific locations. To address these knowledge gaps, this study (a) introduces an algorithm to coordinate residential EV charging, and (b) proposes a comprehensive framework that evaluates all transformers within a feeder. The proposed method is applied to a real-world feeder, which includes 120 transformers of varying capacities. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively manages a substantial number of EVs without overloading any of the transformers, while also pinpointing locations that must be prioritized for future upgrades. This framework can serve as a valuable reference for utilities when conducting distribution system evaluations for supporting the growing EV penetration.</p>

            <h2>Missing Money and Market-Based Adequacy in Deeply Decarbonized Power Systems with Long-Duration Energy Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Suski, Elina Spyrou, Richard Green</p>
            <p>The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaun Sweeney, Robert Shorten, Mark O'Malley</p>
            <p>This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics. Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes. The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule. Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution. Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes.

            <h2>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Passos</p>
            <p>In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced system inertia and increased the need for fast frequency response (FFR) in modern power systems. Data centers, as large and flexible electrical consumers, hold great potential to contribute to frequency stabilization due to their controllable IT workloads and on-site uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of leveraging data centers for providing fast frequency response through real-time workload modulation and UPS coordination. A dynamic model combining data center power consumption and grid frequency dynamics is developed, capturing the interactions between IT servers, cooling systems, and energy storage. Control strategies based on frequency deviation are implemented to adjust server power and discharge UPS batteries during frequency events. Case studies on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce frequency nadir and shorten recovery time without compromising service quality. The results highlight the promising role of data centers as grid-supporting resources in future low-inertia systems.</p>

            <h2>Coordinated Fast Frequency Response from Electric Vehicles, Data Centers, and Battery Energy Storage Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaojie Tao, Rajit Gadh</p>
            <p>High renewable penetration has significantly reduced system inertia in modern power grids, increasing the need for fast frequency response (FFR) from distributed and non-traditional resources. While electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) have each demonstrated the capability to provide sub-second active power support, their combined frequency response potential has not been systematically evaluated. This paper proposes a coordinated control framework that aggregates these heterogeneous resources to provide fast, stable, and reliable FFR. Dynamic models for EV fleets, data center UPS and workload modulation, and BESS are developed, explicitly capturing their response times, power limits, and operational constraints. A hierarchical control architecture is introduced, where an upper-level coordinator dynamically allocates FFR among resources based on response speed and available capacity, and lower-level controllers implement the actual power response. Case studies based on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the coordinated EV-DC-BESS framework improves frequency nadir by up to 0.2 Hz, reduces RoCoF, and accelerates frequency recovery compared with single-resource FFR. Results confirm that synergistic coordination significantly enhances grid stability, especially in low-inertia scenarios. This work highlights the value of multi-resource aggregation for future frequency regulation markets in renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <p>We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\Delta$ are provided.

            <h2>On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez</p>
            <p>Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.</p>

            <p>Multi-active bridge (MAB) converters, the core of the state-of-the-art medium-voltage power electronic transformers, can flexibly connect multiple DC ports among distributed DC grids and loads, but suffer from hard switching under conventional single phase-shift control, especially under unbalanced voltage conversion ratios and light load conditions. Although some offline methods manage to improve the efficiency through complex optimization structures, there lacks online optimization methods that are simple but effective due to the strong coupling among ports of the converter. By leveraging the time-domain model of the MAB converter under the multiple phase-shift modulation scheme, this paper simplifies the optimization process and proposes an online optimization method that can achieve full zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation regardless of the load conditions. The proposed method has simple solutions with only voltage conversion ratios involved and can be implemented within a wide operation range without additional sensors or advanced controllers. A four-port MAB converter is constructed as the prototype. The simulation and experimental results have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed online strategy in achieving ZVS operation, dynamic response, and efficiency improvement.</p>

            <p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy for power electronics, but it highly relies on manually-derived and topology-specific analytical models, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming in practical designs. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper introduces a Digital-Twin-based MPC (DT-MPC) framework for generic power converters that can systematically translate a high-level circuit into an objective-aware control policy by leveraging a DT as a high-fidelity system model. Furthermore, a physics-informed neural surrogate predictor is proposed to accelerate predictions by DT and enable real-time operation. A gradient-free simplex search optimizer is also introduced to efficiently handle complex multi-objective optimization. The efficacy of the framework has been validated through a cloud-to-edge deployment on a 1500 W dual active bridge converter. Experimental results show that the synthesized predictive model achieves an inference speed over 7 times faster than real time, the DT-MPC controller outperforms several human-designed counterparts, and the overall framework reduces engineering design time by over 95\%, verifying the superiority of DT-MPC on generalized power converters.</p>

            <p>Growing EV adoption can worsen traffic conditions if chargers are sited without regard to their impact on congestion. We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.</p>

            <h2>Braess' Paradoxes in Coupled Power and Transportation Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minghao Mou, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Transportation electrification introduces strong coupling between the power and transportation systems. In this paper, we generalize the classical notion of Braess' paradox to coupled power and transportation systems, and examine how the cross-system coupling induces new types of Braess' paradoxes. To this end, we model the power and transportation networks as graphs, coupled with charging points connecting to nodes in both graphs. The power system operation is characterized by the economic dispatch optimization, while the transportation system user equilibrium models travelers' route and charging choices. By analyzing simple coupled systems, we demonstrate that capacity expansion in either transportation or power system can deteriorate the performance of both systems, and uncover the fundamental mechanisms for such new Braess' paradoxes to occur. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the occurrences of Braess' paradoxes for general coupled systems, leading to managerial insights for infrastructure planners. For general networks, through characterizing the generalized user equilibrium of the coupled systems, we develop efficient algorithms to detect Braess' paradoxes and novel charging pricing policies to mitigate them.</p>

            <h2>Electric Road Systems for Smart Cities: A Scalable Infrastructure Framework for Dynamic Wireless Charging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishit Agnihotri, Amit Chaurasia</p>
            <p>The transition to electric transportation is a key enabler for intelligent and sustainable cities; however, inadequate charging infrastructure remains a major barrier to large-scale electric vehicle (EV) adoption. This paper presents a scalable Electric Road System (ERS) architecture that enables Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC) of EVs during motion. The proposed framework integrates inductive charging coils embedded in road pavement, real-time vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, and adaptive energy management coordinated with smart grid systems. Modular road segments with a standardized charging process are employed to ensure scalability across urban corridors and interoperability among different EV platforms. System performance is evaluated using a co-simulation framework combining MATLAB-based power analysis with traffic inputs generated in SUMO. Key performance metrics include charging efficiency, energy cost per kilometer, and battery lifecycle improvement. Simulation results indicate a potential reduction in range anxiety and an increase in battery lifespan due to frequent shallow charging cycles. The study further discusses deployment challenges, policy considerations, and energy distribution strategies aligned with climate-resilient urban development. A case study of a tier-1 Indian city is presented to analyze the cost-benefit trade-offs of retrofitting high-density urban corridors with ERS. The proposed framework provides a practical foundation for next-generation EV infrastructure planning in smart cities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiachen Tian, Yu Han, Xiao Li, Shi Jin, Chao-Kai Wen</p>
            <p>Mid-band extra-large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), emerging as a critical enabler for future communication systems, is expected to deliver significantly higher throughput by leveraging the extended bandwidth and enlarged antenna aperture. However, power consumption remains a significant concern due to the enlarged system dimension, underscoring the need for thorough investigations into efficient system design and deployment. To this end, an in-depth study is conducted on mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, a comprehensive power consumption model is proposed, encompassing the power consumption of major hardware components and signal processing procedures, while capturing the influence of key system parameters. Considering typical near-field propagation characteristics, closed-form approximations of throughput are derived, providing an analytical framework for assessing energy efficiency (EE). Based on the proposed framework, the scaling law of EE with respect to key system configurations is derived, offering valuable insights for system design. Subsequently, extensions and comparisons are conducted among representative multi-antenna technologies, demonstrating the superiority of mid-band XL-MIMO in EE. Extensive numerical results not only verify the tightness of the throughput analysis but also validate the EE evaluations, unveiling the potential of energy-efficient mid-band XL-MIMO systems.</p>

            <h2>An End-to-End Approach for Microgrid Probabilistic Forecasting and Robust Operation via Decision-focused Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tingwei Cao, Yan Xu</p>
            <p>High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Electricity markets are under increasing pressure to maintain reliability amidst rising renewable penetration, demand variability, and occasional price shocks. Traditional capacity market designs often fall short in addressing this by relying on expected-value metrics of energy unserved, which overlook risk exposure in such systems. In this work, we present CapOptix, a capacity pricing framework that interprets capacity commitments as reliability options, i.e., financial derivatives of wholesale electricity prices. CapOptix characterizes the capacity premia charged by accounting for structural price shifts modeled by the Markov Regime Switching Process. We apply the framework to historical price data from multiple electricity markets and compare the resulting premium ranges with existing capacity remuneration mechanisms.</p>

            <p>This comprehensive literature review examines the emerging applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in power system engineering. Through a systematic analysis of recent research published between 2020 and 2025, we explore how LLMs are being integrated into various aspects of power system operations, planning, and management. The review covers key application areas including fault diagnosis, load forecasting, cybersecurity, control and optimization, system planning, simulation, and knowledge management. Our findings indicate that while LLMs show promising potential in enhancing power system operations through their advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities, significant challenges remain in their practical implementation. These challenges include limited domain-specific training data, concerns about reliability and safety in critical infrastructure, and the need for enhanced explainability. The review also highlights emerging trends such as the development of power system-specific LLMs and hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional power engineering methods. We identify crucial research directions for advancing the field, including the development of specialized architectures, improved security frameworks, and enhanced integration with existing power system tools. This survey provides power system researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM applications in the field and outlines future pathways for research and development.</p>

            <h2>Bidding Aggregated Flexibility in European Electricity Auctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Ellemund, Thomas Hübner, Quentin Lété, Stefano Bracco, Matteo Fresia, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>Bidding flexibility in day-ahead and intraday auctions would enable decentralized flexible resources, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, to efficiently align their consumption with the intermittent generation of renewable energy. However, because these resources are individually too small to participate in those auctions directly, an aggregator (e.g., a utility) must act on their behalf. This requires aggregating many decentralized resources, which is a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient and highly accurate method that is readily applicable to European day-ahead and intraday auctions. Distinct from existing methods, we aggregate only economically relevant power profiles, identified through price forecasts. The resulting flexibility is then conveyed to the market operator via exclusive groups of block bids. We evaluate our method for a utility serving the Swiss town of Losone, where flexibility from multiple heat pumps distributed across the grid must be aggregated and bid in the Swiss day-ahead auction. Results show that our method aggregates accurately, achieving 98% of the theoretically possible cost savings. This aggregation accuracy remains stable even as the number of heat pumps increases, while computation time grows only linearly, demonstrating strong scalability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rudolf Reiter, Chao Qin, Leonard Bauersfeld, Davide Scaramuzza</p>
            <p>Many aerial tasks involving quadrotors demand both instant reactivity and long-horizon planning. High-fidelity models enable accurate control but are too slow for long horizons; low-fidelity planners scale but degrade closed-loop performance. We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines. Ablations and Pareto analyses confirm robust gains across horizon variations, constraint approximations, and smoothing schedules.</p>

            <h2>Can Carbon-Aware Electric Load Shifting Reduce Emissions? An Equilibrium-Based Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqian Jiang, Olivier Huber, Michael C. Ferris, Line Roald</p>
            <p>An increasing number of electric loads, such as hydrogen producers or data centers, can be characterized as carbon-sensitive, meaning that they are willing to adapt the timing and/or location of their electricity usage in order to minimize carbon footprints. However, the emission reduction efforts of these carbon-sensitive loads rely on carbon intensity information such as average carbon emissions, and it is unclear whether load shifting based on these signals effectively reduces carbon emissions. To address this open question, we design a carbon-aware equilibrium model, which expands the commonly used equilibrium model for standard (carbon-agnostic) electricity market clearing to include carbon-sensitive consumers that adapt their consumption based on average carbon emission signals and carbon costs. This analysis represents an idealized situation for carbon-sensitive consumers, where their carbon preferences are reflected directly in the market clearing, and contrasts with current practice, where carbon emission signals only become known to consumers a posteriori (i.e., after the market has already been cleared). Furthermore, we extend our model to consider temporal load shifting and time-varying maximum renewable generations. We employ illustrative three-bus examples and numerical simulations on the IEEE RTS-GMLC system to reveal the limitations of the widely adopted average carbon emission signal for guiding carbon emission reduction. Our model offers a novel perspective for evaluating the effectiveness of different carbon signals and contributes to new carbon signal design.</p>

            <h2>SpectrumFM: A Foundation Model for Intelligent Spectrum Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuhui Zhou, Chunyu Liu, Hao Zhang, Wei Wu, Qihui Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek, Chan-Byoung Chae</p>
            <p>Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models, suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management. SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%, achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Kang, Xiaoyu Peng, Kui Luo, Xi Ru, Feng Liu</p>
            <p>With the extensive integration of volatile and uncertain renewable energy, power systems face significant challenges in primary frequency regulation due to instantaneous power fluctuations. However, the maximum frequency deviation constraint is inherently non-convex, and commonly used two-stage dispatch methods overlook causality, potentially resulting in infeasible day-ahead decisions. This paper presents a controlled evolution-based day-ahead robust dispatch method to address these issues. First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability. Additionally, a novel controlled evolution-based algorithm is developed to solve this framework efficiently. Case studies on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in enhancing frequency security and system reliability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuhai Wang, Tiebin Mi, Chun Wang, Rujing Xiong, Zhengyu Wang, Robert Caiming Qiu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the capabilities and effectiveness of backward localization centered on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In the backward sensing paradigm, the region of interest (RoI) is illuminated using a set of diverse radiation patterns. These patterns encode spatial information into a sequence of measurements, which are subsequently processed to reconstruct the RoI. We show that a single RIS can estimate the direction of arrival of incident waves by leveraging configurational diversity, and that the spatial diversity provided by multiple RISs further improves the accuracy of source localization and power estimation. The underlying structure of the sensing operator in the multi-snapshot measurement process is clarified. For single-RIS localization, the sensing operator is decomposed into a product of structured matrices, each corresponding to a specific physical process: wave propagation to and from the RIS, the relative phase offsets of elements with respect to the reference point, and the applied phase configuration of each element. A unified framework for identifying key performance indicators is established by analyzing the conditioning of the sensing operators. In the multi-RIS setting, we derive--via rank analysis--the governing law among the RoI size, the number of elements, and the number of measurements. Upper bounds on the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm are derived. These bounds clarify how key performance indicators affect estimation error and provide valuable guidance for system-level optimization. Numerical experiments confirm that the trend of the relative error is consistent with the theoretical bounds.</p>

            <p>Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling full-space signal manipulation and enhancing wireless network coverage and capacity. In this article, we present a comprehensive analytical comparison of STAR-RIS-assisted systems with single-input single-output (SISO), conventional RISs, and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying schemes, including both half-duplex (HD) and full-duplex (FD) modes. Closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable secrecy rates of STAR-RIS-aided communications under both the absence and presence of eavesdroppers. Unlike most existing works, the direct source destination link is incorporated in all considered schemes, and optimal transmit power allocation is investigated for HD and FD-DF relaying. Furthermore, we provide the conditions under which STAR-RIS outperforms HD- and FD-DF relaying and quantify the minimum number of STAR-RIS elements required to achieve superior rates. The impacts of key system parameters including transmit power, number of elements, reflection-to-transmission power ratio, element-splitting factor, and deployment positions on both achievable and secrecy performance are investigated. The results reveal that STAR-RIS systems can achieve superior rates and secrecy rates compared to all benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p>This letter addresses the joint air corridor planning and base station (BS) deployment problem for low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks.</p>

            <p>The ability to construct channel knowledge map (CKM) with high precision is essential for environment awareness in 6G wireless systems. However, most existing CKM construction methods formulate the task as an image super-resolution or generation problem, thereby employing models originally developed for computer vision. As a result, the generated CKMs often fail to capture the underlying physical characteristics of wireless propagation. In this paper, considering that acquiring channel observations incurs non-negligible time and cost, we focus on constructing CKM for large-scale fading scenarios without relying on prior observations, and we design three physics-based constraints to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of large-scale fading. By integrating these physical constraints with state-of-the-art diffusion model that possesses superior generative capability, a physics-inspired diffusion model for CKM construction is proposed. Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM.</p>

            <p>Short-term voltage stability assessment (STVSA) is critical for secure power system operation.

A dedicated adversarial training strategy is developed to defend against both white-box and gray-box attacks. Furthermore, diverse PQC architectures are benchmarked to explore trade-offs between expressiveness, convergence, and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate the adversarial vulnerability of quantum machine learning-based STVSA.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Zelaya-Arrazabal, Sebastian Martinez-Lizana, Hector Pulgar-Painemal, Jin Zhao</p>
            <p>This paper presents a hybrid model-AI framework for real-time dynamic security assessment of frequency stability in power systems. The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches.</p>

            <h2>Impact and Mitigation of Current Saturation Algorithms in Grid-Forming Inverters on Power Swing Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanshu Niu, Zhe Yang, Bikash C. Pal</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs) are widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, and are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. The corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory. To mitigate this issue, an optimal current saturation strategy is proposed. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Ren, Daniel Quevedo, Salah Sukkarieh, Guodong Shi</p>
            <p>Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</p>

            <h2>New Algorithm for Structured OFDM Channel Estimation using Subgroup Duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Demerson N. Gonçalves, João T. Dias</p>
            <p>This paper presents a group-theoretic framework for structured channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). By modeling subcarriers as the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_N\), we show that nulling a subgroup \(H \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N\) constrains the channel impulse response to its annihilator \(H^\perp\) in the dual domain. A low-complexity estimator is proposed that detects such structure by evaluating energy concentration across candidate annihilators. Simulations demonstrate consistent gains in mean squared error, bit error rate, and throughput compared with least-squares and linear minimum mean square error baselines, achieving competitive performance with substantially lower complexity and preserved interpretability.</p>

            <h2>Electric Arc Furnaces Scheduling under Electricity Price Volatility with Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruonan Pi, Zhiyuan Fan, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for optimizing the operation of electric arc furnaces (EAFs) under volatile electricity prices. We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Frequency and Voltage Strength in Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems Based on Eigen-subsystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huisheng Gao, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Zhiyi Li, Ping Ju</p>
            <p>The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.</p>

            <h2>Power Control of Multi-Layer Repeater Networks (POLARNet)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Siwerson, Johan Thunberg</p>
            <p>In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tinko Sebastian Bartels, Tongxin Li</p>
            <p>The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor (CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Seung Ko, Jae Woong Shim, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)-based control framework that enables comprehensive power smoothing for hyperscale AI datacenters with large load variations. Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Miller, Petros Karamanakos, Tobias Geyer</p>
            <p>Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation technique in which a switching signal is computed offline through an optimization process that accounts for selected performance criteria, such as current harmonic distortion. The optimization determines both the switching angles (i.e., switching times) and the pattern structure (i.e., the sequence of voltage levels). This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Gracia-Calvo, Francesca Rossi, Eduardo Iraola, Juan Carlos Olives-Camps, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo</p>
            <p>Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments.</p>

            <h2>Saturation-based robustly optimal hierarchical operation control of microgrids</h2>

            <p>This paper studies the problem of robustly optimal operation control of microgrids with a high share of renewable energy sources. The main goal is to ensure optimal operation under a wide range of circumstances, given the highly intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable sources and load demand. We formally state this problem, and, in order to solve it, we make effective use of the hierarchical power system control approach. We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy. We prove that this enables the use of constant power setpoints to achieve optimal operation under certain conditions. In order to relax these conditions, the approach is combined with an energy management system, which solves a robust unit commitment problem within a model predictive control framework. Finally, a case study demonstrates the viability of the control design.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Transmission Switching and Busbar Splitting in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Bastianel, Marta Vanin, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun</p>
            <p>Driven by global climate goals, an increasing amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is currently being installed worldwide. Especially in the context of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most effective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid AC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and meshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited literature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the total power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed. The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.</p>

            <p>This article investigates on the improvement and stabilization of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) output voltages in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a vertical-axis tidal turbine using advanced control strategies. The research integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to enhance voltage stability and efficiency. Initially, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach based on Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy logic controllers is explored. To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers. The hybrid ANN-PSO technique improves the voltage regulation by dynamically adapting to system variations and providing real-time reference speed adjustments. This research highlights the AI-based hybrid optimization benefit to stabilize the output voltage of tidal energy systems, thereby increasing reliability and efficiency in renewable energy applications.</p>

            <p>Shading faults remain one of the most critical challenges affecting photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, as they not only reduce power generation but also disturb maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\&O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions.</p>

            <p>This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.</p>

            <p>This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risk arising from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Harsha Nagarajan, Deepjyoti Deka, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>The adversarial worst-case load shedding (AWLS) problem is pivotal for identifying critical contingencies under line outages. It is naturally cast as a bilevel program: the upper level simulates an attacker determining worst-case line failures, and the lower level corresponds to the defender's generator redispatch operations. Conventional techniques using optimality conditions render the bilevel, mixed-integer formulation computationally prohibitive due to the combinatorial number of topologies and the nonconvexity of AC power flow constraints. To address these challenges, we develop a novel single-level optimal value-function (OVF) reformulation and further leverage a data-driven neural network (NN) surrogate of the follower's optimal value. To ensure physical realizability, we embed the trained surrogate in a physics-constrained NN (PCNN) formulation that couples the OVF inequality with (relaxed) AC feasibility, yielding a mixed-integer convex model amenable to off-the-shelf solvers. To achieve scalability, we learn a sparse, area-partitioned NN via spectral clustering; the resulting block-sparse architecture scales essentially linearly with system size while preserving accuracy. Notably, our approach produces near-optimal worst-case failures and generalizes across loading conditions and unseen topologies, enabling rapid online recomputation. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems demonstrate the method's scalability and solution quality for large-scale contingency analysis, with an average optimality gap of 5.8% compared to conventional methods, while maintaining computation times under one minute.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate cooperative platoon formation and benefit allocation in mixed-energy truck fleets composed of both electric and fuel-powered trucks. The central challenge arises from the platoon-size constraint, which limits the number of trucks permitted in each platoon and introduces combinatorial coupling into the search for optimal platoon formation structures. We formulate this problem as a coalitional game with bounded coalition sizes and derive a closed-form characterization of the optimal coalition structure that maximizes the fleet-wide platooning benefit. Building on this structure, we develop a type-based least-core payoff allocation scheme that guarantees stability within the coalition-structure core (CS-core). For cases in which the CS-core is empty, we compute the least-core radius to determine the minimal relaxation required to achieve approximate stability. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves the highest total platooning benefit among all feasible formation configurations while providing stable benefit allocations that outperform existing baseline methods.</p>

This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongchuan Yang, Naiyu Wang, Zhenguo Wang, Min Ouyang, Can Wan</p>
            <p>Power outages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) pose serious risks to electric power systems and the communities they serve. Accurate, high-resolution outage forecasting is essential for enabling both proactive mitigation planning and real-time emergency response. This study introduces the SpatioTemporal Outage ForeCAST (STO-CAST) model, a deep learning framework developed for real-time, regional-scale outage prediction during TC events with high-resolution outputs in both space and time. STO-CAST integrates static environmental and infrastructure attributes with dynamic meteorological and outage sequences using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully connected layers, and is trained via a Leave-One-Storm-Out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy along with holdout grid experiments to demonstrate its preliminary generalization capability to unseen storms and grids. The model produces hourly outage forecasts at a 4 km * 4 km resolution and supports dual forecasting modes: short-term nowcasting with a 6-hour lead time via assimilation of real-time observations, and long-term forecasting with a 60-hour lead time based on evolving meteorological projections. A case study on Typhoon Muifa (2022) demonstrates STO-CAST's operational effectiveness, including error decomposition across model design, meteorological uncertainty, and observation gaps, while highlighting the value of real-time data assimilation and the model's capacity to identify evolving outage hotspots. STO-CAST offers a scalable, data-driven solution to support risk-informed emergency response and enhance power system resilience under intensifying TC threats.</p>

This motivates the development of standardized carbon metrics as a bridge between algorithmic decisions and their physical consequences. We next embed these signals into scheduling and planning frameworks, presenting two architectures: (i) an iterative signal-response loop for real-time operations, and (ii) an integrated optimization that learns and encodes flexible-load behavior for long-term planning. Finally, we show how the same coordination stack supports resilience, enabling signals to shift from emissions-first to stability-first during stress events, providing targeted relief and faster restoration.</p>

            <h2>Momentum-Accelerated Online Feedback Optimization for Power System Flexibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Matthis Berger, Irina Zettl, Andreas Ulbig</p>
            <p>Flexibility is increasingly gaining importance in modern power system operation. This paper presents a controller framework based on Online Feedback Optimization for real-time coordination of power system flexibility. The proposed approach introduces a momentum-augmented projection-step to accelerate convergence and improve dynamic performance. We derive the controller formulation, and evaluate its performance and stability in two representative case studies. The first examines online congestion management in distribution feeders, and the second addresses multi-layer flexibility dispatch across system interfaces. Numerical results demonstrate that the momentum-based controller achieves faster convergence and maintains constraint satisfaction, highlighting its potential for real-time flexibility control in large-scale power systems.</p>

            <h2>Training-Free Robot Pose Estimation using Off-the-Shelf Foundational Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurence Liang</p>
            <p>Pose estimation of a robot arm from visual inputs is a challenging task. However, with the increasing adoption of robot arms for both industrial and residential use cases, reliable joint angle estimation can offer improved safety and performance guarantees, and also be used as a verifier to further train robot policies. This paper introduces using frontier vision-language models (VLMs) as an ``off-the-shelf" tool to estimate a robot arm's joint angles from a single target image. By evaluating frontier VLMs on both synthetic and real-world image-data pairs, this paper establishes a performance baseline attained by current FLMs. In addition, this paper presents empirical results suggesting that test time scaling or parameter scaling alone does not lead to improved joint angle predictions.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli</p>
            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <h2>RIS-Assisted Generalized Receive Quadrature Spatial Modulation with Extension to Multicast Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad H. Dinan, Khatereh Nadali, Mark F. Flanagan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted generalized receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-GRQSM) scheme to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of RIS-aided \textit{quadrature} spatial modulation (QSM) systems. By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.</p>

            <p>In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art. Video: this https URL</p>

            <p>Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings.

By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josue Andino, Milan Prodanovic, Javier Roldan-Perez</p>
            <p>The impedance criterion has emerged as an alternative way to stability assessment of grid-connected power electronic converters. However, the lack of physical meaning of impedance and admittance matrices hinders the ability to understand the root cause of instabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of Pauli decomposition to the impedance matrices and the minor loop of grid-connected power electronic converters. The application of this methodology simplifies establishing the link between impedance matrix terms and closed-loop stability properties. Moreover, Pauli decomposition transforms impedance matrices in a quaternion-like form that is helpful to assess the root cause of instabilities. The theoretical contributions are validated using a case study consisting of a power electronic converter connected to a weak grid that has been previously analysed in the literature using existing techniques.</p>

            <p>The increasing electric power consumption and the shift towards renewable energy resources demand for new ways to operate transmission and subtransmission grids. Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a feedback real-time control method that can be employed to enable optimal operation of these grids. Such controllers can maximize grid efficiency (e.g., minimizing curtailment) while satisfying grid constraints like voltage and current limits. The OFO control method is tailored and extended to handle discrete inputs and it is explained how to design an OFO controller for the subtransmission grid. A novel benchmark is presented and published that corresponds to the real French subtransmission grid on which the proposed controller is analyzed in terms of robustness against model mismatch, constraint satisfaction, and tracking performance. It is shown that OFO controllers can help utilize the grid to its full extent, virtually reinforce it, and operate it optimally and in real-time by using the flexibility offered by renewable generators connected to distribution grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjian Tuo, Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>Day-ahead generation scheduling is typically conducted by solv-ing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, with fast-growing of inverter-based resources, grid inertia has been dramatically reduced, compromising the dy-namic stability system. Traditional SCUC (T-SCUC), without any inertia requirements, may no longer be effective for renewa-bles-dominated grids. To address this, we propose the active linearized sparse neural network-embedded SCUC (ALSNN-SCUC) model, utilizing machine learning (ML) to incorporate system dynamic performance. A multi-output deep neural net-work (DNN) model is trained offline on strategically-selected data samples to accurately predict frequency stability metrics: locational RoCoF and frequency nadir. Structured sparsity and active ReLU linearization are implemented to prune redundant DNN neurons, significantly reducing its size while ensuring pre-diction accuracy even at high sparsity levels. By embedding this ML-based frequency stability predictor into SCUC as con-straints, the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model minimizes its com-putational complexity while ensuring frequency stability follow-ing G-1 contingency. Case studies show that the proposed ALSNN-SCUC can enforce pre-specified frequency requirements without being overly conservative, outperforming five bench-mark models including T-SCUC, two physics-based SCUC, and two ML-based SCUC. The proposed sparsification and active linearization strategies can reduce the DNN-SCUC computing time by over 95% for both IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Scheduling for High Renewables-Integrated Energy Systems with Battery Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunzhi Zhao, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>In high renewables-integrated power systems, irrespective to their sizes, energy storage is commonly included and utilized to mitigate fluctuations from both the load and renewable power generation, ensuring system reliability, among which battery energy storage system (BESS) are experiencing fast-growth in recent years. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithi-um-ion batteries, have been extensively deployed. The degrada-tion of these batteries significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately quantify the battery degrada-tion; however, the model complexity hinders their applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different scales. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach, in-troducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery deg-radation model (SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the scheduled BESS operational profiles. This approach achieves accurate degradation prediction while substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network model. The computational burden of day-ahead energy scheduling when integrating battery degradation can thus be substantially alleviated. Case studies, conducted on both small-scale microgrids and large-scale bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency and suitability of the proposed optimal energy scheduling model that can effectively address battery degrada-tion concerns while optimizing day-ahead energy scheduling op-erations.</p>

            <h2>Generation Expansion Planning with Upstream Supply Chain Constraints on Materials, Manufacturing, and Deployment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyu Yao, Andrey Bernstein, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Masoumi, Mert Korkali</p>
            <p>Dynamic security control (DSC) is considered a pivotal step for the future power grid, which is increasingly penetrated by inverter-based resources. However, the efficiency of such practices, whether governed by automatic generation control or virtual inertia scheduling, can be intractable due to the complexity of the problem and the need to solve the differentialalgebraic equation in a timely manner with the required accuracy. In this regard, the model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates reliable performance. In addition, the introduction of fault-tolerant and near-term quantum computing terminologies, i.e., noisy intermediate-scale quantum, opens avenues for improving the performance of model-free algorithms leveraging quantum capabilities. This paper provides an organized framework and assesses its dependability by evaluating the performance of a quantum-embedded algorithm on the DSC of the IEEE 39-bus test system. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate promising applications, along with shortcomings that can be addressed and further developed later.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a direct comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for adaptive steam temperature control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs), particularly under valve leakage faults. Maintaining precise steam temperature in HRSGs is critical for efficiency and safety, yet traditional control strategies struggle with nonlinear, fault-induced dynamics. Both architectures are designed to adaptively tune the gains of a PI-plus-feedforward control law in real-time. The LSTM controller, a purely data-driven approach, was trained offline on historical operational data, while the PINN controller integrates fundamental thermodynamic laws directly into its online learning process through a physics-based loss function. Their performance was evaluated using a model validated with data from a combined cycle power plant, under normal load changes and a challenging valve leakage fault scenario. Results demonstrate that while the LSTM controller offers significant improvement over conventional methods, its performance degrades under the unseen fault. The PINN controller consistently delivered superior robustness and performance, achieving a 54\% reduction in integral absolute error compared to the LSTM under fault conditions. This study concludes that embedding physical knowledge into data-driven control is essential for developing reliable, fault-tolerant autonomous control systems in complex industrial applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Vladimir Dvorkin, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.</p>

            <p>In modern power systems, frequency regulation is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring system reliability and assessing the robustness of expansion projects.

Consequently, deep reinforcement learning methods are increasingly employed to design adaptive controllers that can be generalized to diverse frequency control tasks. At the same time, recent advances in quantum computing provide avenues for embedding quantum capabilities into such critical applications. In particular, the potential of quantum algorithms can be more effectively explored and harnessed on near-term quantum devices by leveraging insights from active controller design. In this work, we incorporate a quantum circuit together with an ansatz into the operation of a deep deterministic policy gradient agent. The simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach that can achieve reliable, robust performance across diverse real-world challenges.</p>

            <p>The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology.</p>

            <p>Enhanced computational capabilities of modern decision-making software have allowed us to solve increasingly sophisticated optimisation problems. But in complex socio-economic, technical environments such as electricity markets, transparent operation is key to ensure a fair treatment of all parties involved, particularly regarding dispatch decisions. We address this issue by building on the concept of counterfactual explanations, answering questions such as "Why was this generator not dispatched?" by identifying minimum changes in the input parameters that would have changed the optimal solution. Both DC Optimal Power Flow and Unit Commitment problems are considered, wherein the variable parameters are the spatial and temporal demand profiles, respectively. The thereby obtained explanations allow users to identify the most important differences between the real and expected market outcomes and observe which constraints have led to the solution. The framework uses a bilevel optimisation problem to find the counterfactual demand scenarios. State-of-the-art methods are compared with data-driven heuristics on the basis of computational efficiency and explanation accuracy. Results show that leveraging historical data from previously solved instances can provide significant speed benefits and allows us to derive explanations in cases where conventional methods would not be tractable.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maoyuan Ma, Wangyi Guo, Lei Yang, Zhanbo Xu, Xiaohong Guan</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.</p>

            <p>Industrial installations across several sectors have seen a dramatic increase in productivity, accuracy and efficiency over the last decade due to expanded utilization of medium voltage, variable speed power electronic converters to drive their processes. Specifically, active front-end (AFE) drives have become popular due to their ability to deliver power while maintaining safe electrical setpoints. However, under abnormal grid conditions such as phase loss, conventional AFE control may fail to enforce safety constraints, potentially leading to drive shutdown and significant financial losses. In this work, we propose using reference-tracking Performance Boosting (rPB) to improve the resilience of standard AFE control to faults. This neural-network control framework provides a principled way to optimize transient performance while preserving the steady-state tracking properties of AFE-based drives. By carefully shaping the input signals to the rPB controller, we ensure that it activates only during grid faults, leaving nominal operation unaffected. Simulation results show that the proposed approach successfully maintains the DC bus voltage and the grid current within safe limits during single-phase loss events.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid Sequential Convex Programming Framework for Unbalanced Three-Phase AC OPF</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sary Yehia, Alessandra Parisio</p>
            <p>This paper presents a hybrid Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) framework for solving the unbalanced three-phase AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem. The method combines a fixed McCormick outer approximation of bilinear voltage-current terms, first-order Taylor linearisations, and an adaptive trust-region constraint to preserve feasibility and promote convergence. The resulting formulation remains convex at each iteration and ensures convergence to a stationary point that satisfies the first-order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the nonlinear OPF. Case studies on standard IEEE feeders and a real low-voltage (LV) network in Cyprus demonstrate high numerical accuracy with optimality gap below 0.1% and up to 2x faster runtimes compared to IPOPT. These results confirm that the method is accurate and computationally efficient for large-scale unbalanced distribution networks.</p>

            <h2>CaFTRA: Frequency-Domain Correlation-Aware Feedback-Free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation for 6G and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Qian, Hanlin Wu, Jiacheng Chen, Yunting Xu, Xiaoyu Wang, Haibo Zhou, Yusheng Ji</p>
            <p>The fundamental design of wireless systems toward AI-native 6G and beyond is driven by the need for ever-increasing demand of mobile data traffic, extreme spectral efficiency, and adaptability across diverse service scenarios. To overcome the limitations posed by feedback-based multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we propose a novel frequency-domain Correlation-aware Feedback-free MIMO Transmission and Resource Allocation (CaFTRA) framework tailored for fully-decoupled radio access networks (FD-RAN) to meet the emerging requirements of AI-Native 6G and beyond. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</p>

            <h2>Doppler Robust Vortex Wavefront Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Liu, Wen-Xuan Long, M. R. Bhavani Shankar, Marco Moretti, Rui Chen, Björn Ottersten</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm for future wireless systems due to spectrum reuse, hardware sharing, and joint waveform design. In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Fault-Tolerant Control of Steam Temperature in HRSG Superheater under Actuator Fault Using a Sliding Mode Observer and PINN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mojtaba Fanoodi, Farzaneh Abdollahi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant control framework for steam temperature regulation in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) subject to actuator faults. Addressing the critical challenge of valve degradation in superheater spray attemperators, we propose a synergistic architecture comprising three components: (1) a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of unmeasured thermal states, (2) a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for estimating multiplicative actuator faults using physical laws as constraints, and (3) a one-sided Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that adapts to the estimated faults while minimizing excessive actuation. The key innovation lies in the framework of closed-loop physics-awareness, where the PINN continuously informs both the observer and controller about fault severity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. Rigorous uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) is established via Lyapunov analysis under practical assumptions. Validated on real HRSG operational data, the framework demonstrates effective fault adaptation, reduced temperature overshoot, and maintains steam temperature within 1°C of the setpoint under valve effectiveness loss. This work bridges control theory and physics-guided machine learning to deliver a practically deployable solution for power plant resilience, with extensions applicable to thermal systems subject to multiplicative faults.</p>
