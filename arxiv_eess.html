            <h2>DualLaguerreNet: A Decoupled Spectral Filter GNN and the Uncovering of the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huseyin Goksu</p>
            <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.</p>

            <h2>GegenbauerNet: Finding the Optimal Compromise in the GNN Flexibility-Stability Trade-off</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huseyin Goksu</p>
            <p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.</p>

            <h2>Tri-Level Stochastic-Robust Co-Planning of Distribution Networks and Renewable Charging Stations With an Adaptive iC&CG Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongheng Wang, Xiemin Mo, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Renewable charging stations (RCSs) that co-locate electric-vehicle (EV) charging with distributed generation (DG) can raise renewable utilization and improve distribution-network (DN) efficiency, yet their variability and the siting-dependent charging demand can overload feeders if placed poorly. This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic framework for scheduling preemptive upgrades of distribution transformers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William A Wheeler, Samuel Chevalier, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Electrification of residential heating and transporta- tion has the potential to overload transformers in distribution feeders. Strategic scheduling of transformer upgrades to antici- pate increasing loads can avoid operational failures and reduce the risk of supply shortages. This work proposes a framework to prioritize transformer upgrades based on predicted loads at each meter, including heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. The framework follows a Monte Carlo approach to forecasting, generating many possible loading instances and collecting a distribution of failure probabilities for each transformer. In each loading instance, heat pumps and EVs are added stochastically to each meter over time, based on an overall estimated growth rate and factors specific to each customer. We set heat pump load profiles by temperature and EV load profiles based on a stochastic driving model and charging pattern. The load profiles feed into network topology and transformer failure models to calculate failure this http URL formulate a cost optimization based on these failure probabilities to schedule transformer upgrades. We demonstrate this approach on a real-world distribution feeder in rural Vermont under low, medium, and high-electrification scenarios. We find generally less than 20% of transformers having substantial risk of failure over a 20-year simulation. Lastly, we develop an optimization routine to schedule upgrades and discuss the expected number of failures.</p>

            <h2>Targeted Algorithmic Purpose-Driven Cyber Attacks in Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahan FakouriFard, Mingxi Liu</p>
            <p>Distributed multi-agent optimization (DMAO) enables the scalable control and coordination of a large population of edge resources in complex multi-agent environments. Despite its great scalability, DMAO is prone to cyber attacks as it relies on frequent peer-to-peer communications that are vulnerable to malicious data injection and alteration. Existing cybersecurity research mainly focuses on \emph{broad-spectrum} attacks that aim to jeopardize the overall environment but fail to sustainably achieve specific or targeted objectives. This paper develops a class of novel strategic purpose-driven algorithmic attacks that are launched by participating agents and interface with DMAO to achieve self-interested attacking purposes. Theoretical foundations, in both primal and dual senses, are established for these attack vectors with and without stealthy features. Simulations on electric vehicle charging control validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithmic attacks and show the impacts of such attacks on the power distribution network.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven EV Charging Load Profile Estimation and Typical EV Daily Load Dataset Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linhan Fang, Jesus Silva-Rodriguez, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption introduces new challenges for distribution grids due to large, localized load increases, stochastic charging behavior, and limited data availability. This paper proposes two data-driven methods to estimate residential EV charging profiles using real-world customer meter data from CenterPoint Energy serving the Houston area. The first approach applies a least-squares estimation to extract average charging rates by comparing aggregated EV and non-EV meter data, enabling a statistical method for starting and ending charge times. The second method isolates EV load from meter profiles and applies a kernel density estimation (KDE) to develop a probabilistic charging model. Both methods produce a distinct "u-shaped" daily charging profile, with most charging occurring overnight. The validated profiles offer a scalable tool for utilities to better anticipate EV-driven demand increases and support proactive grid planning.</p>

            <h2>A congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism for regions allowing passive balancing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Thanh Nguyen, Bart Van Der Holst, Phuong Hong Nguyen, Koen Kok</p>
            <p>Maintaining system balance becomes increasingly challenging as market design and grid capacity enhancement lag behind the growing share of renewables, requiring greater effort from both the transmission system operator (TSO) and the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs). An actor can support balancing actively by bidding into reserve markets, or passively by adjusting its portfolio in line with system needs. In some countries, BRPs are incentivized to engage in passive balancing when their deviations support overall system stability. However, BRPs focus on profit maximization rather than minimizing portfolio discrepancies, which can cause simultaneous responses to price signals and create issues at the transmission-distribution interface. This research provides a two-stage stochastic model that captures BRP dynamic behavior and their impact on the grid under day-ahead and balancing market price uncertainty across three imbalance pricing mechanisms: the single, dual, and two-price. Then, a congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism is proposed that maintains incentives for passive balancing while satisfying the grid constraint. A proof of concept is provided via the simulation with a part of the Dutch distribution grid. Results show that the proposed method mitigates the unexpected peak flow issue in congested areas while preserving passive balancing contributions from other BRPs in non-congested areas.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez</p>
            <p>Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.</p>

            <h2>Data Center Control Against Sub-Synchronous Resonance: A Data-Driven Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grant Ruan, Marija D. Ilic, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Discounting in Deterministic Black Box Price Predictions for Energy Arbitrage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>This study examines the economic impact of post-hoc uncertainty discounting in predictive energy management, specifically in battery energy arbitrage. A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints. This approach enhances decision-making in energy arbitrage while remaining practical, scalable, and independent of specific forecasting models</p>

            <h2>A Receding Horizon Reinforcement Learning Framework for Campus Chiller Energy Management - A case study from an Australian University</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Musgrave, Arnab Bhattacharjee, Tapan Kumar Saha</p>
            <p>This work presents a case study of optimal energy management of a large Heating Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) system within a university campus in Australia using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The HVAC system supplies to nine university buildings with an annual average electricity consumption of $\sim2$ GWh. Updated chiller Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves are identified, and a predictive building cooling demand model is developed using historical data from the HVAC system. Based on these inputs, a Proximal Policy Optimization based RL model is trained to optimally schedule the chillers in a receding horizon control framework with a priority reward function for constraint satisfaction. Compared to the traditional way of controlling the HVAC system based on a reactive rule-based method, the proposed controller saves up to 28\% of the electricity consumed by simply controlling the mass flow rates of the chiller banks and with minimal constraint violations.</p>

            <h2>Offset-free Data-Driven Predictive Control for Grid-Connected Power Converters in Weak Grid Faults</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo Kraayeveld, Thomas de Jong, Mircea Lazar</p>
            <p>Grid-connected power converters encounter significant stability challenges during weak grid faults, when conventional PI-based controllers exhibit an oscillatory response and poor fault-ride-through performance. This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids.</p>

            <h2>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal</p>
            <p>Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</p>

            <h2>Towards AC Feasibility of DCOPF Dispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael A. Boateng, Russell Bent, Sidhant Misra, Parikshit Pareek, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Daniel Molzahn</p>
            <p>DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is widely utilized in power system operations due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5.</p>

            <h2>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HyunJoong Kim, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</p>

            <h2>Strategic Data Center Load Shifting: Implications for Market Efficiency and Transmission Value</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aron Brenner, Line Roald, Saurabh Amin</p>
            <p>Data center electricity use may reach 12% of U.S. demand by 2030, alongside growing ability to shift workloads geographically in response to prices or carbon signals. We examine the system-level implications of such strategic flexibility using a bilevel two-zone model that couples economic dispatch with consumer cost minimization. Two market failures emerge. First, discontinuous price changes at generator capacity limits can induce flexible consumers to shift load in socially inefficient directions-for example, toward a higher-cost region to trigger a price drop elsewhere. Second, by positioning near capacity boundaries, consumers can eliminate the marginal value of transmission expansion: although shadow prices suggest additional capacity is valuable, consumers reoptimize to offset resulting flow changes, leaving dispatch and costs unchanged. We derive conditions under which these effects arise and show that conventional price signals and planning methods can misrepresent system value in the presence of large flexible loads.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.</p>

            <h2>Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala, Lei Wu, Panos J. Antsaklis</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs). Unlike existing methods that treat control synthesis and topology design separately, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously optimizes both aspects to achieve voltage and frequency regulation and proportional power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). We formulate the closed-loop AC MG as a networked system where DGs, distribution lines, and loads are interconnected subsystems characterized by their dissipative properties. Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.</p>

            <h2>Neural Directional Filtering Using a Compact Microphone Array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilong Huang, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli, Mhd Modar Halimeh, Oliver Thiergart, Emanuël A. P. Habets</p>
            <p>Beamforming with desired directivity patterns using compact microphone arrays is essential in many audio applications. Directivity patterns achievable using traditional beamformers depend on the number of microphones and the array aperture. Generally, their effectiveness degrades for compact arrays. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural directional filtering (NDF) approach that leverages deep neural networks to enable sound capture with a predefined directivity pattern. The NDF computes a single-channel complex mask from the microphone array signals, which is then applied to a reference microphone to produce an output that approximates a virtual directional microphone with the desired directivity pattern. We introduce training strategies and propose data-dependent metrics to evaluate the directivity pattern and directivity factor. We show that the proposed method: i) achieves a frequency-invariant directivity pattern even above the spatial aliasing frequency, ii) can approximate diverse and higher-order patterns, iii) can steer the pattern in different directions, and iv) generalizes to unseen conditions. Lastly, experimental comparisons demonstrate superior performance over conventional beamforming and parametric approaches.</p>

            <h2>Statistically Consistent Approximate Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elias Milios, Kim P. Wabersich, Felix Berkel, Felix Gruber, Melanie N. Zeilinger</p>
            <p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective. This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.</p>

            <h2>On The Detection of Minimum Forecast Horizon For Real-Time Scheduling of Energy Storage Systems in Smart Grid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Tetteh Ofoe, Weilun Wang, Lei Wu</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) into power grids has necessitated effective real-time control strategies under uncertain and volatile electricity prices. An important problem of model predictive control of ESSs is identifying the minimum forecast horizon needed to exactly simulate the globally optimal control trajectory. Existing methods in the literature provide only sufficient conditions and might ignore real-world inconsistencies in control actions. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure.</p>

            <h2>DER Day-Ahead Offering: A Neural Network Column-and-Constraint Generation Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiqi Meng, Hongyi Li, Bai Cui</p>
            <p>In the day-ahead energy market, the offering strategy of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators must be submitted before the uncertainty realization in the form of price-quantity pairs. This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage robust adaptive stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions and is up to 100 times faster than Gurobi and 33 times faster than classical column-and-constraint generation on the same 1028-node synthetic distribution network.</p>

            <h2>Wide-Area Feedback Control for Renewables-Heavy Power Systems: A Comparative Study of Reinforcement Learning and Lyapunov-Based Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Nadeem, MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, accurately modeling power grid dynamics is becoming increasingly more complex. Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids.</p>

            <h2>Carbon Reduction Potential and Sensitivity Analysis of Rural Integrated Energy System with Carbon Trading and Coordinated Electric-Thermal Demand Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuxin Yang, Xue Yuan, Donghan Feng, Siru Chen, Yuanhao Feng</p>
            <p>Constructing clean and low-carbon rural integrated energy system (RIES) is a fundamental requirement for supporting China's rural modernization and new-type urbanization. Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Review of Advancements in Powering and Charging Systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harsh Abhinandan, Aditya Dhanraj, Aryan Katoch, R. Raja Singh</p>
            <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones have witnessed a spectacular surge in applications for military, commercial, and civilian purposes. However, their potential for flight is always limited by the finite power budget of their onboard power supplies. The limited flight time problem has led to intensive research into new sources of power and innovative charging strategies to enable protracted, autonomous flight. This paper gives a comparative summary of the current state-of-the-art in UAV power and refuelling technology. The paper begins with an analysis of the variety of energy sources, from classical batteries to fuel cells and hybrid systems, based on their relative advantages and disadvantages in energy density, weight, and safety. Subsequently, the review explores a spectrum of replenishment options, from simple manual battery swapping to sophisticated high-tech automatic docking stations and smart contact-based charging pads. Most of the review is dedicated to the newer technology of wireless power transfer, which involves near-field (inductive, capacitive) and far-field (laser, microwave) technology. The article also delves into the most important power electronic converter topologies, battery management systems, and control approaches that form the core of these charging systems. Finally, it recapitulates the most significant challenges in technical, economic, and social aspects for promising avenues of future research. The comprehensive review is a valuable guide for researchers, engineers, and policymakers striving to enhance UAV operational performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Paglierani, Francesco Linsalata, Vineeth Teeda, Davide Scazzoli, Maurizio Magarini</p>
            <p>This paper presents an autonomous sensing frame- work for identifying and localizing multiple users in Fifth Generation (5G) networks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is not part of the serving access network. Unlike conventional aerial serving nodes, the proposed UAV operates passively and is dedicated solely to sensing. It captures Uplink (UL) Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), and requires virtually no coordination with the network infrastructure. A complete signal processing chain is proposed and developed, encompassing synchronization, user identification, and localization, all executed onboard UAV during flight. The system autonomously plans and adapts its mission workflow to estimate multiple user positions within a single deployment, integrating flight control with real-time sensing. Extensive simulations and a full-scale low- altitude experimental campaign validate the approach, showing localization errors below 3 m in rural field tests and below 8 m in urban simulation scenarios, while reliably identifying each user. The results confirm the feasibility of infrastructure-independent sensing UAVs as a core element of the emerging Low Altitude Economy (LAE), supporting situational awareness and rapid deployment in emergency or connectivity-limited environments.</p>

            <h2>The Liquid Buffer: Multi-Year Storage for Defossilization and Energy Security under Climate Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonard Göke, Jan Wohland, Stefano Moret, André Bardow</p>
            <p>The climate-driven uncertainty of renewable generation and electricity demand challenges energy security in net-zero energy systems. By introducing a scalable stochastic model that implicitly accounts for 51'840 climate years, this paper identifies multi-year storage of liquid hydrocarbons as a key option for managing climate uncertainty and ensuring energy security. In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand.</p>

            <h2>Joint Transmit Beamforming and Reflection Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS Aided Multi-Cell MIMO Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zheng, Shuowen Zhang</p>
            <p>The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will rely on ultra-dense multi-cell deployment to meet the high rate and connectivity demands. However, frequency reuse leads to severe inter-cell interference, particularly for cell-edge users, which limits the communication performance. To overcome this challenge, we investigate a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multi-cell multi-user downlink MIMO communication system, where a BD-RIS is deployed to enhance desired signals and suppress both intra-cell and inter-cell this http URL formulate the joint optimization problem of the transmit beamforming matrices at the BSs and the BD-RIS reflection matrix to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users, subject to the challenging unitary constraint of the BD-RIS reflection matrix and transmit power constraints at the BSs. To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amélie Canin, Cédric Févotte, Nicolas Dobigeon, Dries Van De Putte, Takashi Onaka, Olivier Berné</p>
            <p>MIRI is the imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from $4.9$ to $27.9$ $\mu$m onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Recep Vural, Aymen Khaleel, Ertugrul Basar</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.</p>

            <h2>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HyunJoong Kim, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Michiel Sandra, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson</p>
            <p>As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) becomes an integral part of 6G networks, distributed ISAC (DISAC) is expected to enhance both sensing and communication performance through its decentralized architecture. This paper presents a complete framework to address the challenge of cooperative user tracking in DISAC systems. By incorporating a global probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and a field-of-view-aware access point (AP) management strategy, the framework enables accurate user tracking using radio signals while optimizing AP scheduling. In addition, a real-world distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. The results demonstrate that a centimeter-level root mean-square trajectory error can be achieved. Furthermore, the results show that it is not necessary to keep APs active at all times to maintain high tracking accuracy, indicating the need for robust and efficient AP management. These findings provide valuable insights into practical deployments and the further development of cooperative user tracking techniques in DISAC systems.</p>

            <p>Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.</p>

            <h2>Translation-Symmetric Market: Enabling Incentive Compatibility For DER Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruike Lyu, Chuyi Li, Kedi Zheng, Mengshu Shi, Hongye Guo, Chongqing Kang</p>
            <p>Virtual power plants (VPPs) are indispensable for coordinating the rapidly growing portfolios of distributed energy resources (DERs) and enabling them to deliver multiple services into higher-level electricity markets. However, the profit allocation procedures that govern VPP participants become increasingly challenging to keep incentive-compatible due to the enlarged DER market power within each VPP, compared to directly bidding into the wholesale market. In this paper, we formulate both the VPP's market participation and its internal operation and profit allocation as consistent market-clearing processes. Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.</p>

            <p>Prognostics and Health Management is crucial for the reliability and lifetime assessment of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps. This work, therefore, intends to map the further development of Prognostics and Health Management systems toward ensuring the viability of PEFCs in practical applications.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel blockage-aware hierarchical beamforming framework for movable antenna (MA) systems operating at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies. While existing works on MA systems have demonstrated performance gains over conventional systems, they often neglect the design of specialized codebooks to leverage MA's unique capabilities and address the challenges of increased energy consumption and latency inherent to MA systems. To address these aspects, we first integrate blockage detection into the codebook design process based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, significantly reducing inefficiencies due to beam evaluations done in blocked directions. Then, we use a two-stage approach to reduce the complexity of the joint beamforming and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) optimization problem. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed adaptive codebook successfully improves the Energy Efficiency (EE) and reduces the beam training overhead, substantially boosting the practical deployment potential of RIS-assisted MA systems in future wireless networks.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks requires seamless integration of communication and sensing to support ubiquitous intelligence and real-time, high-reliability applications. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key solution for achieving this convergence, offering joint utilization of spectral, hardware, and computing resources. However, realizing high-performance ISAC remains challenging due to environmental line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, limited spatial resolution, and the inherent coverage asymmetry and resource coupling between sensing and communication. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), featuring low-cost, energy-efficient, and programmable electromagnetic reconfiguration, provide a promising solution to overcome these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive overview of IRS-aided wireless sensing and ISAC technologies, including IRS architectures, target detection and estimation techniques, beamforming designs, and performance metrics. It further explores IRS-enabled new opportunities for more efficient performance balancing, coexistence, and networking in ISAC systems, focuses on current design bottlenecks, and outlines future research directions.

            <p>Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) has emerged as a key architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling cooperative transmission across spatially distributed access points (APs). However, most existing studies rely on idealized channel models and lack hardware validation, leaving a gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment. Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven precoding have shown strong potential for learning nonlinear channel-to-precoder mappings, but their real-world deployment remains limited due to challenges in data collection and model generalization. This work presents a framework for implementing and validating an AI-based precoder on a D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration. A pre-trained graph neural network (GNN)-based model is fine-tuned using real-world channel state information (CSI) collected from the Techtile platform and evaluated under both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios before end-to-end validation. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.7% performance gain over the pre-trained model in the multi-user case after fine-tuning, while in the single-user scenario the model achieves near-maximum ratio transmission (MRT) performance with less than 0.7 bits/channel use degradation out of a total throughput of 5.19 bits/channel use on unseen positions. Further analysis confirms the data efficiency of real-world measurements, showing consistent gains with increasing training samples, and end-to-end validation verifies coherent power focusing comparable to MRT.</p>

            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a disruptive technology enabling future sixth-generation (6G) networks. This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance.</p>

            <h2>Graph Learning for Cooperative Cell-Free ISAC Systems: From Optimization to Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu</p>
            <p>Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous high-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through cooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these capabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization with multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph learning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network as a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user association, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position and velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous graph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight mirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph learning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms integrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), enabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments. Conversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational complexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with share adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed graph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in multi-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional heuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT framework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and signaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Prime Farmland: Solar Siting Tradeoffs for Cost-Effective Decarbonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Papa Yaw Owusu-Obeng, Mai Shi, Max Vanatta, Michael T. Craig</p>
            <p>The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of continued growth in solar photovoltaics are closely tied to siting decisions. But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.</p>

            <h2>Bridging the Data Gap: Spatially Conditioned Diffusion Model for Anomaly Generation in Photovoltaic Electroluminescence Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Hanifi, Sasan Jafarnejad, Marc Köntges, Andrej Wentnagel, Andreas Kokkas, Raphael Frank</p>
            <p>Reliable anomaly detection in photovoltaic (PV) modules is critical for maintaining solar energy efficiency. However, developing robust computer vision models for PV inspection is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and balanced datasets. This study introduces PV-DDPM, a spatially conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates anomalous electroluminescence (EL) images across four PV cell types: multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si), mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si), half-cut multi-c-Si, and interdigitated back contact (IBC) with dogbone interconnect. PV-DDPM enables controlled synthesis of single-defect and multi-defect scenarios by conditioning on binary masks representing structural features and defect positions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that jointly models multiple PV cell types while supporting simultaneous generation of diverse anomaly types. We also introduce E-SCDD, an enhanced version of the SCDD dataset, comprising 1,000 pixel-wise annotated EL images spanning 30 semantic classes, and 1,768 unlabeled synthetic samples. Quantitative evaluation shows our generated images achieve a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 4.10 and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) of 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0007 across all categories. Training the vision--language anomaly detection model AA-CLIP on E-SCDD, compared to the SCDD dataset, improves pixel-level AUC and average precision by 1.70 and 8.34 points, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Resilient Controller Design with Exponential Reaching Law for Enhanced Load Frequency Stability in Multi-Area Interconnected Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Saiful Islam, Rahul Bhadani</p>
            <p>We present a load frequency control strategy deploying a decentralized robust global integral terminal sliding mode control (GITSMC) method to maintain stable frequency and tie-line power in multi-area interconnected microgrids with aggregated uncertainties. To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.</p>

            <h2>Security-Constrained AC/DC Grid Optimal Power Flow Considering Asymmetrical HVDC Grid Operation using Sparse Tableau Formulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar Damanik, Giacomo Bastianel, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun</p>
            <p>This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Taheri, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</p>

            <h2>Large-Signal Stability Guarantees for a Scalable DC Microgrid with Nonlinear Distributed Control: The Slow Communication Scenario</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cornelia Skaga, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Hence, this study explores large-signal stability guarantees of a promising distributed control framework for cyber-physical DC microgrids, ensuring proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. The proposed control framework adopts nonlinear nested control loops--inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed)--specifically designed to simultaneously achieve the control objectives. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops. In particular, by saturating the influence of the outer loop controller in the inner loop, the proposed controller preserves a more convenient mathematical structure, facilitating the scalability of the stability proof using Lyapunov arguments. The effectiveness of our proposed control strategy is supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid following a careful tuning strategy, and a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.</p>

            <h2>Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maharshi Pathak, SungKu Kang, Vanessa C. Whittem, Katherine Bassett, Michael B. Kane, David J. Fannon</p>
            <p>The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.</p>

            <h2>Incremental DRL-Based Resource Management for Dynamic Network Slicing in an Urban-Wide Testbed</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyuan Li, Yuelin Liu, Hari Madhukumar, Amin Emami, Xueqing Zhou, Yulei Wu, Xenofon Vasilakos, Shuangyi Yan, Dimitra Simeonidou</p>
            <p>Multi-access edge computing provides localized resources within mobile networks to address the requirements of emerging latency-sensitive and computing-intensive applications. At the edge, dynamic requests necessitate sophisticated resource management for adaptive network slicing. This involves optimizing resource allocations, scaling functions, and load balancing to utilize only essential resources under constrained network scenarios. However, existing solutions largely assume static slice counts, ignoring the re-optimization overhead associated with management algorithms when slices fluctuate. Moreover, many approaches rely on simplified energy models that overlook intertemporal resource scheduling and are predominantly evaluated through simulations, neglecting critical practical considerations. This paper presents an incremental cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for resource management in dynamic edge slicing. The proposed approach optimizes long-term slicing benefits by reducing delay and energy consumption while minimizing retraining overhead in response to slice variations. Furthermore, we implement an urban-wide edge computing testbed based on OpenStack and Kubernetes to validate the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our incremental MADDPG method outperforms benchmark strategies in aggregated slicing utility and reduces training energy consumption by up to 50% compared to the re-optimization approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Heng Chou, Da-Chih Lin, Hung-Yu Wei, Walid Saad, Yu Tsao</p>
            <p>In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Workload Coupled Migration Optimization Strategy for Virtual Power Plants with Data Centers Considering Fuzzy Chance Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Kai Wu, Zhi-Wei Liu, Yong Zhao, Yan-Wu Wang, Fan-Rong Qu, Chaojie Li</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.</p>

            <h2>Bus Type Switching to Reduce Bound Violations in AC Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Van Boven, Kyri Baker</p>
            <p>Wholesale power markets often use linear approximations of power system constraints. Because it does not consider inequality constraints, using AC power flow for feasibility post-processing can violate bounds on reactive power, voltage magnitudes, or thermal limits. There remains a need for a streamlined analytical approach that can guarantee AC feasibility while adhering to variable bounds. This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach. The proposed method sacrifices the voltage setpoint at a generator in exchange for fixing the voltage at a load bus, thereby moving a degree of freedom around the network. Results on the IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus, and 300-bus test cases demonstrate how switching bus types can reduce overall network violations and help find feasible power system setpoints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesus Silva-Rodriguez, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful algorithm for solving decentralized optimization problems including networked microgrid energy management (NetMEM). However, its performance is highly sensitive to the selection of its penalty parameter \r{ho}, which can lead to slow convergence, suboptimal solutions, or even algorithm divergence. This paper evaluates and compares three district ADMM formulations to solve the NetMEM problem, which explore different methods to determine appropriate stopping points, aiming to yield high-quality solutions. Furthermore, an adaptive penalty heuristic is also incorporated into each method to analyze its potential impact on ADMM performance. Different case studies on networks of varying sizes demonstrate that an objective-based ADMM approach, denominated as OB-ADMM, is significantly more robust to the choice of \r{ho}, consistently yielding solutions closer to the centralized optimal benchmark by preventing premature algorithm stopping.</p>

            <h2>Grid Operational Benefit Analysis of Data Center Spatial Flexibility: Congestion Relief, Renewable Energy Curtailment Reduction, and Cost Saving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoxiang Wan, Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Data centers are facilities housing computing infrastructure for processing and storing digital information. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the power control design for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system that performs integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case where many access points are deployed to simultaneously communicate with mobile users and monitor the surrounding environment at the same time-frequency slot is considered. On top of the user-centric architecture used for the data services, a target-centric approach is introduced for the detection tasks. As a valuable performance metric, we derive the receive sensing signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio under generalized likelihood ratio test processing. Based on that, we formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) scheme that maximizes the two figures of merit: achievable data rate and effective sensing SNR. Simulations demonstrate that our proposal surpasses orthogonal resource algorithms, underscoring the potential of ISAC-enabled CF-mMIMO networks.</p>

            <p>HVDC networks offer several advantages over traditional HVAC systems, particularly for long-distance power transmission and integration of renewable energy sources, such as reduced losses and enhanced stability and control, but also increase the risk of oscillations. This study investigates electrical resonant phenomena associated with HVDC stations through numerical EMT simulations. The findings indicate that electrical resonance is primarily pronounced in weak networks with long cables, as confirmed by the Nyquist criterion applied to frequency responses. Two real cases were successfully simulated in the time domain by introducing network changes, such as temporary faults and alterations in network's power strength, to activate the identified resonances. Notably, in a strong network with short cables, electrical resonance occurred alongside interactions between the network and the converter's protection system. The analysis of voltage waveforms revealed that the amplitude of the induced resonant harmonic dissipates quickly, indicating sufficient damping in the network configuration. Furthermore, the study confirmed the network's sensitivity to changes in converter parameters modeled using available MMC model.</p>

            <p>In recent years, frequent extreme events have put forward higher requirements for improving the resilience of distribution networks (DNs). Introducing energy storage integrated with soft open point (E-SOP) is one of the effective ways to improve resilience. However, the widespread application of E-SOP is limited by its high investment cost. Based on this, we propose a cost allocation framework and optimal planning method of E-SOP in resilient DN. Firstly, a cost allocation mechanism for E-SOP based on resilience insurance service is designed; the probability of power users purchasing resilience insurance service is determined based on the expected utility theory. Then, a four-layer stochastic distributionally robust optimization (SDRO) model is developed for E-SOP planning and insurance pricing strategy, where the uncertainty in the intensity of contingent extreme events is addressed by a stochastic optimization approach, while the uncertainty in the occurrence of outages and resilience insurance purchases resulting from a specific extreme event is addressed via a distributionally robust optimization approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on the modified IEEE 33-bus DN.</p>

Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Yuan, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swadesh Vhakta, Denis Osipov, Reetam Sen Biswas, Amritanshu Pandey, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage frequency instability risks from a steady-state perspective, without the need for derivative-dependent transient modeling. Specifically, we jointly address two questions (Q1) Survivability: following a disturbance and the subsequent primary frequency response, can the system settle into a healthy steady state (feasible with an acceptable frequency deviation $\Delta f$)? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: if found unstable, what critical vulnerabilities create instability and/or full collapse? To address these questions, we first augment steady-state power flow states to include frequency-dependent governor relationships (i.e., governor power flow). Afterwards, we propose a frequency-aware sparse optimization that finds the minimal set of bus locations with measurable compensations (corrective actions) to enforce power balance and maintain frequency within predefined/acceptable bounds. We evaluate our method on standard transmission systems to empirically validate its ability to localize dominant sources of vulnerabilities. For a 1354-bus large system, our method detects compensations to only four buses under N-1 generation outage (3424.8 MW) while enforcing a maximum allowable steady-state frequency drop of 0.06 Hz (otherwise, frequency drops by nearly 0.08 Hz). We further validate the scalability of our method, requiring less than four minutes to obtain sparse solutions for the 1354-bus system.</p>

            <p>Power system time series analytics is critical in understanding the system operation conditions and predicting the future trends. Despite the wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, many AI-based time series analytical models suffer from task-specificity (i.e. one model for one task) and structural rigidity (i.e. the input-output format is fixed), leading to limited model performances and resource wastes. In this paper, we propose a Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model (CM-LLM) that can solve heterogeneous power system time-series analysis tasks. First, we introduce a physics-statistics combined causal discovery mechanism to capture the causal relationship, which is represented by graph, among power system variables. Second, we propose a multimodal data preprocessing framework that can encode and fuse text, graph and time series to enhance the model performance. Last, we formulate a generic "mask-and-reconstruct" paradigm and design a dynamic input-output padding mechanism to enable CM-LLM adaptive to heterogeneous time-series analysis tasks with varying sample lengths. Simulation results based on open-source LLM Qwen and real-world dataset demonstrate that, after simple fine-tuning, the proposed CM-LLM can achieve satisfying accuracy and efficiency on three heterogeneous time-series analytics tasks: missing data imputation, forecasting and super resolution.</p>

Second, a deep-learning neural network-based watermarking model with specially designed loss functions and network structure is proposed to embed watermarks into the original dataset. Third, a frequency-domain data preprocessing method is proposed to eliminate the frequency bias of neural networks when learning time series datasets to enhance the model performances. Last, a comprehensive watermarking performance evaluation framework is designed for measuring its invisibility, restorability, robustness, secrecy, false-positive detection, generalization, and capacity. Case studies based on practical load and photovoltaic time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

            <p>Aluminium is manufactured through the Hall-Héroult process, which is very energy intensive. Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed. The results yield insight into the optimal line current and ACD profiles for different power modulation scenarios including the time of use electricity tariff and spot price. These results can form the foundation for further studies into online control policies of aluminium reduction cells.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Theory for Transient Synchronization Stability Analysis of Renewable Dominated Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Zhan, Miao Han, Yayao Zhang, Hongsheng Xu, Jiabing Hu, Shijie Cheng, Jürgen Kurths</p>
            <p>The change of electric power generation - from synchronous generator (SG) to converter - is generally regarded as the second revolution of power system. Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%. This elegant nonlinear-dynamics-based approach establishes a unified theory including modelling and analysis for the RDPS transient dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Power Hardware-in-the-loop Interfacing via $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Model Matching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Eid, Ashley Meagher, Dmitry Rimorov, Anil Kumar Bonala, Rajendra Thike, James Richard Forbes</p>
            <p>This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model matching control-based approach to the problem of power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) interfacing. The objective is to interconnect a grid simulation and a physical device via an interface in a way that is stable and accurate. Conventional approaches include the ideal transformer method (ITM) and its impedance-based variants, which trade accuracy for stability, as well as some $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control-based approaches, which do not make use of all the available information in their optimization for accuracy. Designing for transparency, as opposed to accuracy as existing approaches do, would achieve both accuracy and stability, while making use of all the dynamical information present in the idealized interconnection of the grid and device. The approach proposed in this paper employs model matching to formulate the PHIL problem as an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control problem using transparency as the explicit frequency-domain control objective. The approach is experimentally validated in a real-time resistive-load PHIL setup, and is found to achieve accuracy levels that are comparable or superior to those of an ITM-based interface.</p>

            <h2>Active Short Circuit and Safe Discharge Mechanisms in Multi-Phase Inverters During Critical Failures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhesh Pimpale, Sagar Mahadik</p>
            <p>The multi-phase inverter has become more complicated, particularly in an Electric Vehicle (EV)'s power train, which requires a robust fault protection system. The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.</p>

            <h2>Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanzhe Zhang, Yuke Li, Wenjun Mei</p>
            <p>In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Downlink-Uplink Spectrum Sharing between Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Mukherjee, Bho Matthiesen, Armin Dekorsy, Petar Popovski</p>
            <p>6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous and Distributed Synchronization and Restoration of an Islanded Network of Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Saad Al-Karsani, Maryam Khanbaghi</p>
            <p>The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) are leading to the formation of Microgrids (MGs) and Network of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode, which requires Grid-Forming (GFM) IBRs that can perform black start, synchronization, restoration and regulation. However, such IBRs face synchronization instability issues, which might be worsened by inadequate secondary level frequency and voltage regulation. Accordingly, we propose an autonomous and distributed synchronization and restoration scheme using Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control. To validate the proposed method, we model and simulate a high-fidelity islanded and modified IEEE 123 bus system, modeled as an NMG consisting of 7 MGs. The simulation results demonstrate an effective autonomous soft-start, synchronization, connection and regulation procedure using DAPI control and distributed breaker operation logic.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Mukherjee, Ramij R. Hossain, Kaustav Chatterjee, Sameer Nekkalapu, Marcelo Elizondo</p>
            <p>This paper explores the development of learning-based tunable control gains using EMT-in-the-loop simulation framework (e.g., PSCAD interfaced with Python-based learning modules) to address critical sub-synchronous oscillations. Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.</p>

            <h2>A Multi-Criterion Approach to Smart EV Charging with CO2 Emissions and Cost Minimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Ambrosino, Khai Manh Nguyen, Minh Binh Vu, Riadh Zorgati, Laurent El Ghaoui, Giuseppe C. Calafiore</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a novel three-step framework for smart electric vehicle (EV) charging that jointly minimizes charging costs and CO2 emissions. Drawing inspiration from the classical Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), we first design a linear model to determine the optimal power generation mix over a 24-hour horizon, using real-world data from Vietnam, a country with a highly carbon intensive energy system. This allows us to estimate time-varying CO2 emissions and translate them into an emission cost signal. We then incorporate this environmental cost into a smart charging optimization model, formulated as a linear program (LP). Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline First-In-First-Served (FIFS) approach, achieving notable reductions in both CO2 emissions and charging costs also compared to another optimization approach. The results demonstrate the potential of this multiobjective optimization framework to support more sustainable and cost-efficient EV charging strategies.</p>

            <h2>Coherency Analysis in Nonlinear Heterogeneous Power Networks: A Blended Dynamics Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixuan Liu, Yingzhu Liu, Pengcheng You</p>
            <p>Power system coherency refers to the phenomenon that machines in a power network exhibit similar frequency responses after disturbances, and is foundational for model reduction and control design. Despite abundant empirical observations, the understanding of coherence in complex power networks remains incomplete where the dynamics could be highly heterogeneous, nonlinear, and increasingly affected by persistent disturbances such as renewable energy fluctuations. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the blended dynamics approach, originally rooted in consensus analysis of multi-agent systems, to develop a novel coherency analysis in power networks. We show that the frequency responses of coherent machines coupled by nonlinear power flow can be approximately represented by the blended dynamics, which is a weighted average of nonlinear heterogeneous nodal dynamics, even under time-varying disturbances. Specifically, by developing novel bounds on the difference between the trajectories of nodal dynamics and the blended dynamics, we identify two key factors -- either high network connectivity or small time-variation rate of disturbances -- that contribute to coherence. They enable the nodal frequencies to rapidly approach the blended-dynamics trajectory from arbitrary initial state. Furthermore, they ensure the frequencies closely follow this trajectory in the long term, even when the system does not settle to an equilibrium. These insights contribute to the understanding of power system coherency and are further supported by simulation results.</p>

            <h2>Partial-Power Flow Controller, Voltage Regulator, and Energy Router for Hybrid AC-DC Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ehsan Asadi, Davood Keshavarzi, Alexander Koehler, Nima Tashakor, Stefan Goetz</p>
            <p>The share of electronically converted power from renewable sources, loads, and storage is continuously growing in the low- and medium-voltage grids. These sources and loads typically rectify the grid AC to DC, e.g., for a DC link, so that a DC grid could eliminate hardware and losses of these conversion stages. However, extended DC grids lack the stabilizing nature of AC impedances so that the voltage is more fragile and power flows may need active control, particularly if redundancy as known from AC, such as rings and meshing, is desired. Furthermore, a DC infrastructure will not replace but will need to interface with the existing AC grid. This paper presents a partial-power energy router architecture that can interface multiple AC and DC lines to enable precise control of voltages and both active as well as reactive power flows. The proposed system uses modular low-voltage high-current series modules supplied through dual active bridges. These modules only need to process a small share of the voltage to control large power flows. The topology reduces component size, cost, energy losses, and reliability more than three times compared to conventional technology. The optional integration of battery energy storage can furthermore eliminate the need for the sum of the power flows of all inputs to be zero at all times. Through dynamic voltage injection relative to the line voltage, the modules effectively balance feeder currents, regulate reactive power, and improve the power factor in AC grids. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop and prototype measurements validate the proposed energy router's performance under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results confirm the series module's functionality in both AC and DC grids as an effective solution for controlling extended grids, including power sharing, voltage, and power quality.</p>

            <h2>Voltage-Regulated Sparse Optimization for Proactive Diagnosis of Voltage Collapses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinghua Ma, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Ming Shi, Jan Drgona, Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage the voltage collapse risks, i.e., the risk of bus voltages violating the safe operational bounds, which can be caused by extreme events and contingencies. We jointly answer two resilience-related research questions: (Q1) Survivability: Upon having an extreme event/contingency, will the system remain feasible with voltage staying within a (preferred) safe range? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: If voltage collapses, what are the dominant sources of system vulnerabilities responsible for the failure? This highlights some key locations worth paying attention to in the planning or decision-making process. To address these questions, we propose a voltage-regulated sparse optimization that finds a minimal set of bus locations along with quantified compensations (corrective actions) that can simultaneously enforce AC network balance and voltage bounds. Results on transmission systems of varying sizes (30-bus to 2383-bus) demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates voltage collapses by compensating at only a few strategically identified nodes, while scaling efficiently to large systems, taking on average less than 4 min for 2000+ bus cases. This work can further serve as a backbone for more comprehensive and actionable decision-making, such as reactive power planning to fix voltage issues.</p>

            <p>Wearable photoacoustic imaging devices hold great promise for continuous health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics. However, the large data volume generated by high-density transducer arrays presents a major challenge for realizing compact and power-efficient wearable systems. This paper presents a photoacoustic imaging receiver (RX) that embeds compressive sensing directly into the hardware to address this bottleneck. The RX integrates 16 AFEs and four matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM) SAR ADCs that perform energy- and area-efficient analog-domain compression. The architecture achieves a 4-8x reduction in output data rate while preserving low-loss full-array information. The MVM SAR ADC executes passive and accurate MVM using user-defined programmable ternary weights. Two signal reconstruction methods are implemented: (1) an optimization approach using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, and (2) a learning-based approach employing implicit neural representation. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the chip achieves an ADC's SNDR of 57.5 dB at 20.41 MS/s, with an AFE input-referred noise of 3.5 nV/sqrt(Hz). MVM linearity measurements show R^2 > 0.999 across a wide range of weights and input amplitudes. The system is validated through phantom imaging experiments, demonstrating high-fidelity image reconstruction under up to 8x compression. The RX consumes 5.83 mW/channel and supports a general ternary-weighted measurement matrix, offering a compelling solution for next-generation miniaturized, wearable PA imaging systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a high-fidelity evaluation framework for machine learning (ML)-based classification of cyber-attacks and physical faults using electromagnetic transient simulations with digital substation emulation at 4.8 kHz. Twelve ML models, including ensemble algorithms and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were trained on labeled time-domain measurements and evaluated in a real-time streaming environment designed for sub-cycle responsiveness. The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage). These findings demonstrate that offline accuracy alone is an unreliable indicator of field readiness and underscore the need for realistic testing and inference pipelines to ensure dependable classification in inverter-based resources (IBR)-rich networks.</p>

            <p>Background and Objective: Colorectal cancer prevention relies on early detection of polyps during colonoscopy. Existing public datasets, such as CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts. There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using Olympus 170 and Pen- tax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate baseline performance, we provide bench- mark results for classification using VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises 1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation. Performance was lower compared to curated datasets, reflecting the real-world difficulty of images with artifacts and variable quality.</p>

            <p>This work proposes a two-layered control scheme for constrained nonlinear systems represented by a class of recurrent neural networks and affected by additive disturbances. In particular, a base controller ensures global or regional closed-loop l_p-stability of the error in tracking a desired equilibrium and the satisfaction of input and output constraints within a robustly positive invariant set. An additional control contribution, derived by combining the internal model control principle with a stable operator, is introduced to improve system performance. This operator, implemented as a stable neural network, can be trained via unconstrained optimisation on a chosen performance metric, without compromising closed-loop equilibrium tracking or constraint satisfaction, even if the optimisation is stopped prematurely. In addition, we characterise the class of closed-loop stable behaviours that can be achieved with the proposed architecture. Simulation results on a pH-neutralisation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern power systems has intensified the need for resilient and efficient microgrid solutions. DC microgrids have gained prominence due to their reduced conversion losses, simplified interfacing with DC-based RESs, and improved reliability. To manage the inherent variability of RESs and ensure stable operation, energy management systems (EMS) have become essential. While various EMS algorithms have been proposed and validated using real-time simulation platforms, most assume ideal communication conditions or rely on simplified network models, overlooking the impact of realistic communication delays on EMS performance. This paper presents a novel real-time cyber-physical system (CPS) testbed for evaluating EMS performance in DC microgrids under realistic communication delays. The proposed testbed integrates a DC microgrid modeled in OPAL-RT with an EMS controller implemented on a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The communication network is emulated using EXataCPS, enabling the exchange of actual power system traffic and the replication of realistic latency conditions. This comprehensive setup captures the interplay between power system dynamics, EMS control, and communication network behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Turker Takci, James Day, Meysam Qadrdan</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of data centres poses an evolving challenge for power systems with high variable renewable energy. Traditionally operated as passive electrical loads, data centres, have the potential to become active participants that provide flexibility to the grid. However, quantifying and utilising this flexibility have not yet been fully explored. This paper presents an integrated, whole facility optimisation model to investigate the least cost operating schedule of data centres and characterise the aggregate flexibility available from data centres to the power system. The model accounts for IT workload shifting, UPS energy storage, and cooling system. Motivated by the need to alleviate the increasing strain on power systems while leveraging their untapped flexibility potential, this study makes two primary contributions: (i) an operational optimisation model that integrates IT scheduling, UPS operation, and cooling dynamics to establish a cost optimal baseline operation, and (ii) a duration-aware flexibility assessment that, for any given start time and power deviation, computes the maximum feasible duration from this baseline while respecting all operational, thermal, and recovery constraints. This method characterises the aggregate flexibility envelope. Results reveal a clear temporal structure and a notable asymmetry in flexibility provision: upward flexibility (electricity load reduction) is driven by deferring IT workload, which allows for a secondary reduction in cooling power. Downward flexibility (electricity load increase) relies on increasing power consumption of the cooling system, supported by the TES buffer, and charging the UPS. This framework translates abstract flexibility potential into quantified flexibility magnitude and duration that system operators could investigate for use in services such as reserve, frequency response, and price responsive demand.</p>

            <p>The prevalence of user-generated content (UGC) on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok has rendered no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA) vital for optimizing video delivery. Nonetheless, the characteristics of non-professional acquisition and the subsequent transcoding of UGC video on sharing platforms present significant challenges for NR-VQA. Although NR-VQA models attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective scores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of fine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these challenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the semantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video metadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted from inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in generating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been designed to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic alignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These multimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality scores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving improved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations. Our method achieves the best performance in terms of average rank and linear correlation (SRCC: 0.928, PLCC: 0.938) compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code and trained models, along with a user-friendly demo, are available at: this https URL.</p>

            <h2>When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cayetana Salinas Rodriguez, Jonathan Rogers, Sarah H.Q. Li</p>
            <p>We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) mapping is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. In those cases the leader needs to simultaneously infer this BR function while fulfilling an internal objective. We study a setting in which the leader selects a control strategy that optimizes an objective given an initial belief about the follower's best response. This belief is updated during the finite decision horizon, prompting the leader to reoptimize its control. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop (OL) and feedback (FB) information structures. In particular, we show that it is possible that assuming an incorrect follower BR map obtains a lower cost over the game horizon than knowing the true BR. We support these claims with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rathin Chandra Shit, Sharmila Subudhi</p>
            <p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\epsilon$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p>

            <p>Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model for precise diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers, including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning (ML) modeling algorithms were implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUROC of 1.00 and a testing AUROC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable ML model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.</p>

            <h2>Time-Frequency Mode Decomposition: A Morphological Segmentation Framework for Signal Analysis and Its Application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Zhou, Wei-Jian Li, Desen Zhu, Hongbin Xu, Wei-Xin Ren</p>
            <p>While time-frequency analysis provides rich representations of multicomponent signals, current signal decomposition methods fail to fully exploit the spatial structure of time-frequency distributions, where components often manifest as morphologically distinct regions. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition (TFMD), a novel framework that reframes signal decomposition as a morphological segmentation task in the time-frequency domain. TFMD constructs a unique TF mask for each component by first identifying high-energy core regions with unsupervised k-means clustering, segmenting them with connected-component labeling and a size filter, and then expanding each core using an iterative competitive dilation algorithm to form the complete TF mask, enabling precise isolation and reconstruction of individual modes. Validation on a comprehensive suite of synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately identifies the number of components and reconstructs them with high fidelity, particularly excelling in high-noise conditions. A comparative analysis confirms that TFMD offers robust and competitive performance across diverse signal types, outperforming several benchmark methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Its practical utility is demonstrated by successfully decomposing a non-stationary wind turbine vibration signal, where a two-stage $\mathrm{TFMD}^2$ approach effectively isolates both the fundamental rotational frequency components and their weaker harmonic components across varying operational speeds. TFMD thus provides an accurate, adaptive, and efficient morphological segmentation framework for multicomponent signal analysis with broad applicability.</p>

            <h2>Onboard Hyperspectral Super-Resolution with Deep Pushbroom Neural Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Piccinini, Diego Valsesia, Enrico Magli</p>
            <p>Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are significantly more complex.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawn Virginillo, Asja Derviškadić, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Due to recent blackout and system split incidents in power grids worldwide, as well as increased system complexity in view of the energy transition, there has been increasing interest in re-evaluating existing Power System Restoration (PSR) plans. In restoration scenarios, due to low island inertia, it is necessary to ensure not only the static, but also the dynamic stability of the system. In this paper, we pose and solve a formulation of the optimal PSR problem including frequency dynamics. We validate the switching constraints for global optimality within a static version of the formulation using a brute-force tree search method. We apply the dynamic problem formulation to the IEEE 9-Bus model, and show that the optimal switching sequence using the static formulation would violate dynamic constraints, illustrating the importance of dynamic considerations in PSR planning.</p>

            <h2>Computationally Efficient Spline-Based Modeling of DER Dynamics for Voltage Stability in Active Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadrack T. Asiedu, Tara Aryal, Zongjie Wang, Hossein Moradi Rekabdarkolaee, Timothy M. Hansen</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into power systems necessitates the accurate representation of their dynamic behavior at the transmission level. Traditional electromagnetic transient models (EMT), while effective, face scalability challenges due to their reliance on detailed system information. Data-driven approaches, such as System Identification (SysID), offer a promising alternative by modeling system dynamics without detailed system knowledge. However, SysID and similar methods are computationally intensive, requiring the computation of complex ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or transfer functions estimation. This makes them less effective for real-time operation. We therefore propose a novel data-driven approach that simplifies the modeling of DERs dynamics by leveraging B-splines to transform discrete system data into continuous differentiable functions. This enables the estimation of lower order linear ordinary differential equations with simple linear regression to represent the underlying dynamics at a very low computational cost. Furthermore, the extracted dynamic equations are discretized by the backward Euler method for potential integration into discrete-time power dispatch models. Validation results indicate a goodness-of-fit (GoF) of 98.74%, comparable to the 99.03% GoF of the SysID method, yet, 4.8 times faster. Our proposed model's execution time of less than one minute makes it more suitable for real-time applications in power system operations.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating the Impact of a Load Admittance Approximation in Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Junior da Cunha Coelho, Araceli Hernandez, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>The Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF) incorporates dynamic stability constraints into the OPF formulation to ensure secure and economical operation under disturbances. While discretizing system dynamics enables the use of nonlinear programming techniques, it significantly increases computational burden. To enhance scalability, many studies simplify the network by representing loads as constant admittances, allowing the use of Kron reduction. However, computing the Kron reduction outside the optimization requires a voltage-based assumption to convert loads from constant power to constant admittance. This paper proposes a practical voltage-based load admittance approximation and evaluates the errors it may introduce in rotor angle and speed deviation trajectories. Case studies on the WECC 9-bus system show that the proposed approach reproduces rotor dynamics consistent with time-domain simulations during the first few seconds while considerably reducing implementation effort and mitigating convergence issues. The proposed framework thus offers a simple and effective strategy for scalable TSC-OPF implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Karampinis, Petros Ellinas, Johanna Vorwerk, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
            <p>Modern power systems require fast and accurate dynamic simulations for stability assessment, digital twins, and real-time control, but classical ODE solvers are often too slow for large-scale or online applications. We propose a neural-operator framework for surrogate modeling of power system components, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to learn mappings from system states and time-varying inputs to full trajectories without step-by-step integration. To enhance generalization and data efficiency, we introduce Physics-Informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), which embed the residuals of governing equations into the training loss. Our results show that DeepONets, and especially PI-DeepONets, achieve accurate predictions under diverse scenarios, providing over 30 times speedup compared to high-order ODE solvers. Benchmarking against Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights superior stability and scalability. Our results demonstrate neural operators as a promising path toward real-time, physics-aware simulation of power system dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Voltage-Independent Active-Power Droop Coefficient for Enhanced Andronov-Hopf Oscillator Grid-Forming Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Rezazadeh, Mohammad Monfared, Meghdad Fazeli, Saeed Golestan</p>
            <p>In recent years, virtual oscillator control, particularly the Andronov-Hopf oscillator (AHO), has received widespread attention for controlling grid-forming (GFM) inverters due to their superior dynamic response. However, traditional AHO systems feature droop coefficients that are dependent on the oscillator voltage amplitude, limiting their ability to maintain consistent grid support during disturbances and resulting in power-sharing inaccuracies. This paper presents an enhanced AHO (EAHO) strategy, where the active power droop coefficient is no longer a function of the voltage amplitude and retains the key dynamic benefits of the original AHO. The EAHO improves both frequency and voltage support and ensures accurate power sharing with other GFM inverters in grid-connected and stand-alone modes. Extensive comparative and small-signal analyses, alongside experimental validation on 2.5 kVA single-phase inverters, confirm the EAHO's improved steady-state performance, enhanced active and reactive power support, and stable operation under varying grid conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Bernal, Ignacio Ponce, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a coherency control strategy for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) to establish coherence among power system devices. Using the equivalence of the Complex Frequency (CF) of the injected currents as the definition for coherency among devices, the control enforces an output current with a proportional magnitude and a constant phase shift relative to a reference. This formulation makes the control technology-agnostic, enabling coherency with any type of resource. Case studies based on the two-area and IEEE 39-bus systems demonstrate the controller's potential to improve damping and overall dynamic behavior. The paper further evaluates practical implementation aspects including delay/noise sensitivity and the trade-off between oscillation mitigation and disturbance propagation. This work establishes coherency as a viable direct control objective for IBRs in modern power systems.</p>

            <p>As power systems evolve with increasing production from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), their underlying dynamics are undergoing significant changes that can jeopardize system operation, leading to poorly damped oscillations or small-signal rotor angle instability. In this work, we investigate whether Power System Stabilizer (PSS) setting adjustments can effectively restore system stability and provide adequate damping in systems with increased IBR penetration, using the benchmark Kundur Two-Area System as a case study. Specifically, we evaluate the model-based Residues and P-Vref PSS tuning methods to examine their effectiveness under evolving grid conditions. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these tuning methods is not guaranteed, particularly when coordination is limited. Consequently, our case study motivates local and adaptive online PSS tuning methods.</p>

            <p>An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dániel István Németh, Kálmán Tornai</p>
            <p>Electrical load classification is generally divided into intrusive and non-intrusive approaches, both having their limitations and advantages. With the non-intrusive approach, controlling appliances is not possible, but the installation cost of a single measurement device is cheap. In comparison, intrusive, smart plug-based solutions offer individual appliance control, but the installation cost is much higher. There have been very few approaches aiming to combine these methods. In this paper we show that extending a smart plug-based solution to multiple loads per plug can reduce control granularity in favor of lowering the system's installation costs. Connecting various loads to a Smart Plug through an extension cord is seldom considered in the literature, even though it is common in households. This scenario is also handled by the hybrid load classification solution presented in this paper.</p>

            <p>Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</p>

            <p>Buses are a vital component of metropolitan public transport, yet conventional bus services often struggle with inefficiencies including extended dwelling time, which increases in-vehicle travel time for non-alighting passengers. A stop-less autonomous modular (SLAM) bus service has emerged as a solution, enabling dynamic capacity to reduce dwelling time. Meanwhile, the electrification of buses is advancing as a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduces operators' costs, but introduces new operational constraints due to charging requirements. This study develops analytical optimization models for SLAM bus service that integrates vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging technology. By comparing the optimal designs and their feasibility across non-charging case and charging strategies, we identify a sequence of operational stages as ridership grows: from idle capacity under low demand, to full small buses, full large buses, and a proposed frequency-capped regime where only bus capacity expands. Under the mobile charging strategy, this progression further includes an energy-limited regime, in which frequency declines, and ultimately infeasibility under high demand. These findings enable operators to deliver more efficient services.</p>

            <p>Integrating flexible loads and storage systems into the residential sector contributes to the alignment of volatile renewable generation with demand. Besides batteries serving as a short-term storage solution, residential buildings can benefit from a Hydrogen (H2) storage system, allowing seasonal shifting of renewable energy. However, as the initial costs of H2 systems are high, coupling a Fuel Cell (FC) with a Heat Pump (HP) can contribute to the size reduction of the H2 system. The present study develops a Comfort-Oriented Energy Management System for Residential Buildings (ComEMS4Build) comprising Photovoltaics (PV), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and H2 storage, where FC and HP are envisioned as complementary technologies. The fuzzy-logic-based ComEMS4Build is designed and evaluated over a period of 12 weeks in winter for a family household building in Germany using a semi-synthetic modeling approach. The Rule-Based Control (RBC), which serves as a lower benchmark, is a scheduler designed to require minimal inputs for operation. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) is intended as a cost-optimal benchmark with an ideal forecast. The results show that ComEMS4Build, similar to MPC, does not violate the thermal comfort of occupants in 10 out of 12 weeks, while RBC has a slightly higher median discomfort of 0.68 Kh. The ComEMS4Build increases the weekly electricity costs by 12.06 EUR compared to MPC, while RBC increases the weekly costs by 30.14 EUR. The ComEMS4Build improves the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) utilization and energy exchange with the main grid compared to the RBC. However, when it comes to the FC operation, the RBC has an advantage, as it reduces the toggling counts by 3.48% and working hours by 7.59% compared to MPC...</p>

            <p>Hybrid power plants (HPPs) combine multiple power generators (conventional/variable) and energy storage capabilities to support generation inadequacy and grid demands. This paper introduces a modeling and control design framework for hybrid power plants (HPPs) consisting of a wind farm, solar plant, and battery storage.

In the case of wind and battery models, generator torque and cell current control laws are developed using nonlinear control and control barrier function techniques to track a command from a supervisory control law while maintaining safe and stable operation. The utility of this modeling and control framework is illustrated through a test case using a utility demand signal for tracking, time varying wind and irradiance data, and a rule-based supervisory control law.</p>

            <p>The electric grid is increasingly vital, supporting essential services such as healthcare, heating and cooling transportation, telecommunications, and water systems. This growing dependence on reliable power underscores the need for enhanced grid resilience. This study presents Eversource's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) for bulk distribution substations in Massachusetts, evaluating risks from storm surge, sea level rise, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The focus is on developing a cost-efficient model to guide targeted resilience investments. This is achieved by overcoming the limitations of single-variable analyses through hazard-specific assessments that integrate spatial, climate, electrical asset, and other relevant data; and applying sensitivity analysis to establish data-driven thresholds for actionable climate risks. By integrating geospatial analysis and data modeling with power engineering principles, this study provides a practical and replicable framework for equitable, data-informed climate adaptation planning. The results indicate that thresholds for certain climate hazards can be highly sensitive and result in significantly larger sets of stations requiring mitigation measures to adequately adapt to climate change, indicating that high-fidelity long-term climate projections are critical.</p>

            <h2>SolarCrossFormer: Improving day-ahead Solar Irradiance Forecasting by Integrating Satellite Imagery and Ground Sensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Schubnel, Jelena Simeunović, Corentin Tissier, Pierre-Jean Alet, Rafael E. Carrillo</p>
            <p>Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p>

            <h2>Oscillation Analysis and Damping Control for a Proposed North American AC-DC Macrogrid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaustav Chatterjee, Sameer Nekkalapu, Antos Varghese, Marcelo Elizondo, Quan Nguyen, Xiaoyuan Fan</p>
            <p>In recent years, several studies conducted by both industry and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded initiatives have proposed linking North America's Eastern and Western Interconnections (EI and WI) through a multiterminal DC (MTDC) macrogrid. These studies have explored the advantages and opportunities of the proposed configuration from the perspectives of capacity sharing and frequency support. However, the potential challenges of small-signal stability arising from this interconnection have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, detailed model-based simulation studies are performed in this paper to assess the risks of poorly damped inter-area oscillations in the proposed macrogrid. A custom-built dynamic model of the MTDC system is developed and integrated with industry-grade models of the EI and WI, incorporating high levels of inverter-based energy resources. Through model-based oscillation analysis, potential shifts in inter-area modes for both EI and WI, resulting from the MTDC integration are characterized, and modes with inadequate damping are identified. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks of unstable oscillations, supplementary damping controllers are designed for the MTDC system, leveraging wide-area feedback to modulate active power set points at selected converter stations. A frequency scanning approach is employed for data-driven model linearization and controller synthesis. The damping performance is evaluated under the designed operating conditions and selected contingency scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Power Systems Resilience Using Statistical Analysis and Bayesian Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Apsara Adhikari, Charlotte Wertz, Anamika Dubey, Arslan Ahmad, Ian Dobson</p>
            <p>The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is significantly affecting the power grid, causing large-scale outages and impacting power system resilience. Yet limited work has been done on systematically modeling the impacts of weather parameters to quantify resilience. This study presents a framework using statistical and Bayesian learning approaches to quantitatively model the relationship between weather parameters and power system resilience metrics. By leveraging real-world publicly available outage and weather data, we identify key weather variables of wind speed, temperature, and precipitation influencing a particular region's resilience metrics. A case study of Cook County, Illinois, and Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveals that these weather parameters are critical factors in resiliency analysis and risk assessment. Additionally, we find that these weather variables have combined effects when studied jointly compared to their effects in isolation. This framework provides valuable insights for understanding how weather events affect power distribution system performance, supporting decision-makers in developing more effective strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and adaptation to changing climatic conditions.</p>

            <h2>Microgrids optimal radial reconfiguration via FORWARD algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joan Vendrell Gallart, Russell Bent, Solmaz Kia</p>
            <p>Microgrids offer a promising paradigm for integrating distributed energy resources, bolstering energy resilience, and reducing the impact of blackouts. However, their inherent decentralization and dynamic operation present substantial energy management complexities. These complexities, including balancing supply and demand, ensuring system stability, and minimizing operational costs, often necessitate solving computationally intractable NP-hard Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problems. Traditional MINLP solvers struggle with the scalability and feasibility guarantees required for these challenges. To address this, this paper tackles the problem of resource allocation and radial configuration design for microgrid power distribution and proposes and abstracted problem which is solved by introducing a permutation-based iterative search method over the recently introduced FORWARD method to efficiently identify feasible, near-optimal radial network structures while inherently respecting physical constraints. Furthermore, this paper investigates the integration of the proposed method as a warm-start strategy for benchmark MINLP solvers offering a scalable solution for comprehensive microgrid design.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical and Experimental Limitations of RoCoF Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gutierrez-Florensa, F. Sanniti, D. Tedeschi, L. Sigrist, A. Ortega, F. Milano</p>
            <p>A precise estimation of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) is crucial for secure power system operation. In fact, RoCoF is strictly related to the amount of the available physical and/or virtual inertia of the system and the severity of the active power unbalance following a disturbance. For this reason, it is widely exploited in different protection systems, e.g., Anti-Islanding, Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and wide-area protection systems. The new paradigm of modern power systems, with a low-inertia and converter-based generation assets, is increasing the transient severity, making the frequency and the RoCoF estimation more complex and less precise for the actual devices. This work addresses this issue by proposing a numerically robust approach based on concepts inherited from differential geometry and fluid mechanics. The proposed approach is then tested with high-sampling real experimental measurements and used to develop a faster control logic for a RoCoF-based UFLS control scheme. The proposed approach provides information to protections regarding the nature of the contingency which can be used to improve its response.</p>

            <h2>D2-UC: A Distributed-Distributed Quantum-Classical Framework for Unit Commitment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold. First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

            <h2>Explicit Ensemble Learning Surrogate for Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Bahador Javadi, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable generation introduces uncertainty into power systems, challenging traditional deterministic optimization methods. Chance-constrained optimization offers an approach to balancing cost and risk; however, incorporating joint chance constraints introduces computational challenges. This paper presents an ensemble support vector machine surrogate for joint chance constraint optimal power flow, where multiple linear classifiers are trained on simulated optimal power flow data and embedded as tractable hyperplane constraints via Big--M reformulations. The surrogate yields a polyhedral approximation of probabilistic line flow limits that preserves interpretability and scalability. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal costs with a negligible average error of $0.03\%$. These results demonstrate the promise of ensemble surrogates as efficient and transparent tools for risk-aware optimization of power systems.</p>

            <h2>Accounting for Subsystem Aging Variability in Battery Energy Storage System Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melina Graner, Martin Cornejo, Holger Hesse, Andreas Jossen</p>
            <p>This paper presents a degradation-cost-aware optimization framework for multi-string battery energy storage systems, emphasizing the impact of inhomogeneous subsystem-level aging in operational decision-making. We evaluate four scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision and treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational revenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue generated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring heterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced revenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems and the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves operational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged subunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware optimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue per unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario. These findings highlight that modeling aging heterogeneity is not just a technical refinement but may become a crucial enabler for maximizing both short-term profitability and long-term asset value in particular for long BESS usage scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Taheri, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method -- a Quasi-Newton optimization technique -- this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.</p>

            <h2>Gas Fire Power Plant Management Through Numerical Approximation of Spark Spread Options</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babacar Seck, Anas Abdullah</p>
            <p>Cross-commodity valuation approaches to value gas fire power plants are well studied in the literature. Hence, the value of the gas fire power plant is identical to the value of a spark spread option wherein the underlying are electricity and gas with a strike price assimilated to operating and maintenance costs. Power and fuels spot prices account for uncertain futures cash-flows for power-plant generator owners. For instance, for gas-fired turbine plant, spot prices of electricity and gas determine the random cash-flows of the power-plant. Other than the spot prices, the valuation of such plant involves among other deterministic cost the plant heat rate and operating costs. Recently, the cost of emissions is considered into the valuation to tackle environmental issues. Given some simplifications in the plant cash-flow modelling, the value of such plant can either be expressed as the price of i) a cross-commodity option or ii) the price of a real option. Here, we focus on cross-commodity option valuation approach where the value of the power plant is approached as the value of a spark spread option. When spot prices of the underlying commodities are log-normal, closed formulae or approximations can be obtained using Kirk's approximation. Naturally, the spot price of electricity and gas present spikes due to seasonality among other factors. However, in that case it is not possible to get a closed formula for the spark spread option. In this paper we explore possibilities to approximate spark spread options when spot prices fall into a class of jump diffusion processes.</p>

            <h2>Recurrence Plot and Change Quantile-based Deep Supervised and Semi-supervised Protection for Transmission Lines Connected to Photovoltaic Plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pallav Kumar Bera, Samita Rani Pani</p>
            <p>Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines (TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program (PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system, with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise, series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT) saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the approach is effective in handling different system configurations and conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.</p>

            <h2>A Reliability-Cost Optimization Framework for EV and DER Integration in Standard and Reconfigurable Distribution Network Topologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rida Fatima, Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption poses operational and economic challenges for power distribution systems, including increased line loading levels and network congestions. This may require potential infrastructure reinforcement and expansion. As a fast inexpensive alternative solution, network topology reconfiguration (NTR) offers a practical means to redistribute power flows, reduce operational costs, and defer infrastructure upgrades. This paper presents a linear programming framework to evaluate the impact of varying EV penetration on operational costs under four configurations: standard distribution network (SDN), SDN with NTR (SDNTR), SDN with distributed energy resources (SDN-DER), and SDNTR with DERs (SDNTR-DER). Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus system. The analysis demonstrates that integrating DERs reduces operational costs, while NTR further enhances system flexibility, enabling higher EV penetration levels without compromising feasibility. The combined SDNTR-DER approach offers the most cost-effective and reliable pathway for accommodating future EV growth while mitigating the need for immediate infrastructure upgrades.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel control framework designed for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), denoted as Generalized Swing Control (GSC). The proposed GSC framework generalizes the definition of Grid-Forming (GFM) control schemes and exploits the coupling between active and reactive power dynamics. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct extensive time-domain simulations and small-signal analysis using a modified version of the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus dynamic model of the all-island Irish transmission system. The case studies focus on evaluating the dynamic performance of the proposed framework under different configurations, including Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM), coupled-VSM and dual-VSM schemes. To address the nonlinear nature of power system dynamics, sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo methods are employed to improve parameter tuning and assess the stability of GSC configurations in the studied systems.</p>

            <p>The paper proposes a novel general definition of coherency among power system devices of any type. The proposed approach is thus not limited to synchronous machines. With this aim, the paper shows that coherency can be formally based on the difference in the complex frequency of the current injections of any two devices electrically connected to the same grid. The proposed definition is model-agnostic, making it general and suitable for modern power systems composed of a heterogeneous mix of technologies. The paper also provides a systematic analytical procedure to study the properties that specific device models must satisfy to be coherent. Time-domain simulations are conducted in three case studies whose results illustrate the ability of our definition to evaluate coherency among any type of device.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a decentralized methodology for detecting and mitigating flapping phenomena in power systems, primarily caused by the operation of discrete devices. The proposed approach applies moving-window autocorrelation to local measurements, enabling each device to autonomously identify sustained oscillations. Upon detection, a probabilistic, device-specific mitigation strategy is executed. Flexible demand resources (DFRs), under-load tap changers (ULTCs), and automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) are utilised to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach to both discrete and continuous-operation devices. Results show that the proposed method is robust and properly distinguishes damped oscillations from persistent flapping, allowing devices to independently recognize problematic operating scenarios and implement corrective actions accordingly.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel formulation of effective regional inertia that explicitly accounts for both system topology and the spatial distribution of inertia. Unlike traditional approaches that model a region as an aggregated machine with an equivalent inertia, the proposed metric provides a topology-aware representation. The methodology builds on an analytical framework that extends classical slow coherency theory to address network partitioning and regional frequency stability. Based on these partitions, we develop a systematic procedure to evaluate the effective inertia of each region, enabling a more accurate interpretation of local inertial contributions, including those from virtual inertia provided by inverter-based resources (IBRs). Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus systems demonstrate that the integration of inertial devices does not uniformly improve system frequency response, underscoring the importance of the proposed metric for effective regional inertia assessment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiziano Balaconi, Aldo Glielmo, Marco Taboga</p>
            <p>We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjian Tuo, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>TThe rapid expansion of inverter-based resources, such as wind and solar power plants, will significantly diminish the presence of conventional synchronous generators in fu-ture power grids with rich renewable energy sources. This transition introduces in-creased complexity and reduces dynamic stability in system operation and control, with low inertia being a widely recognized challenge. However, the literature has not thoroughly explored grid dynamic performance associated with energy scheduling so-lutions that traditionally only consider grid steady-state constraints. This paper will bridge the gap by enforcing grid dynamic constraints when conducting optimal energy scheduling; particularly, this paper explores locational post-contingency rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) requirements to accommodate substantial inertia reductions. This paper introduces a machine learning-assisted RoCoF-constrained unit commit-ment (ML-RCUC) model designed to ensure RoCoF stability after the most severe generator outage while maintaining operational efficiency. A graph-informed NN (GINN)-based RoCoF predictor is first trained on a high-fidelity simulation dataset to track the highest locational RoCoF, which is then reformulated as mixed-integer linear programming constraints that are integrated into the unit commitment model. Case studies, by solving the optimization problem ML-RCUC and validating its solutions with time-domain simulations, demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure loca-tional RoCoF stability with minimum conservativeness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixiao Yang, Gulai Shen, Ahmed S. Alahmed, Chuchu Fan</p>
            <p>We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering tariffs with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based structure. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to a theoretical upper bound.</p>

This study applies detailed energy system modeling to quantify the Renewable Pull, an incentive for industry relocation exerted by countries with favorable renewable conditions. Results reveal that the Renewable Pull is not a cross-industrial phenomenon but strongly depends on the relationship between energy costs and transport costs. The intensity of the Renewable Pull varies, with China, India, and Japan facing a significantly stronger effect than Germany and the United States. Incorporating national capital cost assumptions proves critical, reducing Germanys Renewable Pull by a factor of six and positioning it as the second least affected top manufacturing country after Saudi Arabia. Using Germany as a case study, the analysis moreover illustrates that targeted import strategies, especially within the EU, can nearly eliminate the Renewable Pull, offering policymakers clear options for risk mitigation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Zhengmao Li, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>In low-carbon grids, system flexibility can be enhanced through mechanisms such as Demand Response (DR), enabling the efficient utilization of renewable energy. However, as Synchronous Generators (SGs) are being replaced with renewable energy characterized by Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), system stability is severely affected. Due to the limited overload capability of IBR, their Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of SGs, which may result in protection devices failing to trip during faults. Consequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in offering sufficient SCC volumes. Given that the commitment of SGs is closely related to system load, DR can thus indirectly affect their SCC provision, a relationship that has not been investigated. Therefore, this paper incorporates both DR and SCC constraints into a unit commitment model and conducts studies on an IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that although DR can reduce social costs by lowering power demand, it may also lead to inadequate SCC levels. Nevertheless, the cost increases by only 0.3% when DR is combined with SCC constraints, indicating that DR can actually help achieve a stable system in a cost-effective manner.</p>

            <h2>Optimal BESS Sizing and Placement for Mitigating EV-Induced Voltage Violations: A Scalable Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Targeting Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The escalating adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing demand for charging solutions are driving a surge in EV charger installations in distribution networks. However, this rising EV load strains the distribution grid, causing severe voltage drops, particularly at feeder extremities. This study proposes a proactive voltage management (PVM) framework that can integrate Monte Carlo-based simulations of varying EV charging loads to (i) identify potential voltage violations through a voltage violation analysis (VVA) model, and (ii) then mitigate those violations with optimally-invested battery energy storage systems (BESS) through an optimal expansion planning (OEP) model. A novel spatio-temporal adaptive targeting (STAT) strategy is proposed to alleviate the computational complexity of the OEP model by defining a targeted OEP (T-OEP) model, solved by applying the OEP model to (i) a reduced set of representative critical time periods and (ii) candidate BESS installation nodes. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed approach are validated on 33-bus, 69-bus, and a large-scale 240-bus system. Results demonstrate that the strategic sizing and placement of BESS not only effectively mitigate voltage violations but also yield substantial cost savings on electricity purchases under time-of-use tariffs. This research offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for integrating high penetrations of EVs, providing crucial insights for future distribution network planning.</p>

            <p>Optimizing the topology of networks is an important challenge across engineering disciplines. In energy systems, network reconfiguration can substantially reduce losses and costs and thus support the energy transition. Unfortunately, many related optimization problems are NP hard, restricting practical applications. In this article, we address the problem of minimizing losses in radial networks, a problem that routinely arises in distribution grid operation. We show that even the computation of approximate solutions is computationally hard and propose quantum optimization as a promising alternative. We derive two quantum algorithmic primitives based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) that differ in the sampling of network topologies: a tailored sampling of radial topologies and simple sampling with penalty terms to suppress non-radial topologies. We show how to apply these algorithmic primitives to distribution grid reconfiguration and quantify the necessary quantum resources.</p>

            <h2>Frequency Quality Assessment of GFM and GFL Converters and Synchronous Condensers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taulant Kerci, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper compares the impact of different conventional and emerging technologies and control strategies on frequency quality. We study, in particular, the long-term dynamic performance of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) as well as conventional synchronous machines. Extensive simulations and several realistic scenarios consider both short-term and long-term aspects of frequency quality. It is shown that, while overall GFM IBRs significantly improve frequency quality, a combination of GFL IBRs providing frequency support such as wind and batteries, and synchronous condensers, might be enough to meet similar frequency quality standards. Another result of the paper is that the need for automatic generation control (AGC) becomes less clear in GFM IBR-dominated grids from a frequency quality perspective.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization of the Resource Scheduling Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Christeson, Md Habib Ullah, Ali Arabnya, Amin Khodaei, Rui Fan</p>
            <p>Resource scheduling is critical in many industries, especially in power systems. The Unit Commitment problem determines the on/off status and output levels of generators under many constraints. Traditional exact methods, such as mathematical programming methods or dynamic programming, remain the backbone of UC solution techniques, but they often rely on linear approximations or exhaustive search, leading to high computational burdens as system size grows. Metaheuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and other evolutionary methods, have been explored to mitigate this complexity; however, they typically lack optimality guarantees, exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions, and can become prohibitively time-consuming for large-scale systems. In this paper, we introduce a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for UC and, by extension, other resource scheduling problems, that leverages Benders decomposition to decouple binary commitment decisions from continuous economic dispatch. The binary master problem is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model and solved on a quantum annealer. The continuous subproblem, which minimizes generation costs, with Lagrangian cuts feeding back to the master until convergence. We evaluate our hybrid framework on systems scaled from 10 to 1,000 generation units. Compared against a classical mixed-integer nonlinear programming baseline, the hybrid algorithm achieves a consistently lower computation-time growth rate and maintains an absolute optimality gap below 1.63%. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum annealing within a hybrid quantum-classical Benders decomposition loop can significantly accelerate large-scale resource scheduling without sacrificing solution quality, pointing toward a viable path for addressing the escalating complexity of modern power grids.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Computing for EVs to Enhance Grid Resilience and Disaster Relief: Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyler Christeson, Amin Khodaei, Rui Fan</p>
            <p>The power grid is the foundation of modern society, however extreme weather events have increasingly caused widespread outages. Enhancing grid resilience is therefore critical to maintaining secure and reliable operations. In disaster relief and restoration, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology allows electric vehicles (EVs) to serve as mobile energy resources by discharging to support critical loads or regulating grid frequency as needed. Effective V2G operation requires coordinated charging and discharging of many EVs through optimization. Similarly, in grid restoration, EVs must be strategically routed to affected areas, forming the mobile charging station placement (CSP) problem, which presents another complex optimization challenge. This work reviews state-of-the-art optimization methods for V2G and mobile CSP applications, outlines their limitations, and explores how quantum computing (QC) could overcome current computational bottlenecks. A QC-focused perspective is presented on enhancing grid resilience and accelerating restoration as extreme weather events grow more frequent and severe.</p>

            <h2>Online Energy Storage Arbitrage under Imperfect Predictions: A Conformal Risk-Aware Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqian Wu, Ming Yi, Bolun Xu, James Anderson</p>
            <p>This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risks arose from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.</p>

            <h2>Wavelet-Based Feature Extraction and Unsupervised Clustering for Parity Detection: A Feature Engineering Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ertugrul Mutlu</p>
            <p>This paper explores a deliberately over-engineered approach to the classical problem of parity detection -- determining whether a number is odd or even -- by combining wavelet-based feature extraction with unsupervised clustering. Instead of relying on modular arithmetic, integers are transformed into wavelet-domain representations, from which multi-scale statistical features are extracted and clustered using the k-means algorithm. The resulting feature space reveals meaningful structural differences between odd and even numbers, achieving a classification accuracy of approximately 69.67% without any label supervision. These results suggest that classical signal-processing techniques, originally designed for continuous data, can uncover latent structure even in purely discrete symbolic domains. Beyond parity detection, the study provides an illustrative perspective on how feature engineering and clustering may be repurposed for unconventional machine learning problems, potentially bridging symbolic reasoning and feature-based learning.</p>

            <p>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^\star$--hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^\star$--that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-level Dynamics and System-Level Strength</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehao Zhuang, Huanhai Xin, Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) technology is widely regarded as a promising solution for future power systems dominated by power electronics. However, a precise method for quantifying GFM converter behavior and a universally accepted GFM definition remain elusive. Moreover, the impact of GFM on system stability is not precisely quantified, creating a significant disconnect between device and system levels. To address these gaps from a small-signal perspective, at the device level, we introduce a novel metric, the Forming Index (FI) to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage fluctuations. Rather than enumerating various control architectures, the FI provides a metric for the converter's GFM ability by quantifying its sensitivity to grid variations. At the system level, we propose a new quantitative measure of system strength that captures the multi-bus voltage stiffness, which quantifies the voltage and phase angle responses of multiple buses to current or power disturbances. We further extend this concept to grid strength and bus strength to identify weak areas within the system. Finally, we bridge the device and system levels by formally proving that GFM converters enhance system strength. Our proposed framework provides a unified benchmark for GFM converter design, optimal placement, and system stability assessment.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Control for a Physics-Informed Model of a Thermal Energy Distribution System: Qualitative Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Seurin, Auradha Annaswamy, Linyu Lin</p>
            <p>Integrated energy systems (IES) are complex heterogeneous architectures that typically encompass power sources, hydrogen electrolyzers, energy storage, and heat exchangers. This integration is achieved through operating control strategy optimization. However, the lack of physical understanding as to how these systems evolve over time introduces uncertainties that hinder reliable application thereof. Techniques that can accommodate such uncertainties are fundamental for ensuring proper operation of these systems. Unfortunately, no unifying methodology exists for accommodating uncertainties in this regard. That being said, adaptive control (AC) is a discipline that may allow for accommodating such uncertainties in real-time. In the present work, we derive an AC formulation for linear systems in which all states are observable and apply it to the control of a glycol heat exchanger (GHX) in an IES. Based on prior research in which we quantified the uncertainties of the GHXs system dynamics, we introduced an error of 50% on four terms of the nominal model. In the case where a linear quadratic regulator is used as the nominal control for the reference system, we found that employing AC can reduce the mean absolute error and integral time absolute error by a factor of 30%-75%. This reduction is achieved with minimal computing overhead and control infrastructure, thus underscoring the strength of AC. However, the control effort induced is significant, therefore warranting further study in order to estimate its impact on a physical system. To address further challenges, including partially observable and non-linear dynamics, enhancements of the linear formulation are currently being developed.</p>

            <h2>Context-Aware Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Energy Resource Aggregators in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chatum Sankalpa, Ghulam Mohy-ud-din, Erik Weyer, Maria Vrakopoulou</p>
            <p>Aggregators of consumer energy resources (CERs) like rooftop solar and battery energy storage (BES) face challenges due to their inherent uncertainties. A sensible approach is to use stochastic optimization to handle such uncertainties, which can lead to infeasible problems or loss in revenues if not chosen appropriately. This paper presents three efficient two-stage stochastic optimization methods: risk-neutral, robust, and chance-constrained, to address the impact of CER uncertainties for aggregators who participate in energy and regulation services markets in the Australian National Electricity Market. Furthermore, these methods utilize the flexibility of BES, considering precise state-of-charge dynamics and complementarity constraints, aiming for scalable performance while managing uncertainty. The problems are formed as two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs, with relaxations adopted for large scenario sets. The solution approach employs scenario-based methodologies and affine recourse policies to obtain tractable reformulations. These methods are evaluated across use cases reflecting diverse operational and market settings, uncertainty characteristics, and decision-making preferences, demonstrating their ability to mitigate uncertainty, enhance profitability, and provide context-aware guidance for aggregators in choosing the most appropriate stochastic optimization method.</p>

            <p>Energy storage can promote the integration of renewables by operating with charge and discharge policies that balance an intermittent power supply. This study investigates the scheduling of energy storage assets under energy price uncertainty, with a focus on electricity markets. A two-stage stochastic risk-constrained approach is employed, whereby electricity price trajectories or specific power markets are observed, allowing for recourse in the schedule. Conditional value-at-risk is used to quantify tail risk in the optimization problems; this allows for the explicit specification of a probabilistic risk limit. The proposed approach is tested in an integrated hydrogen system (IHS) and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In the joint design and operation context for the IHS, the risk constraint results in larger installed unit capacities, increasing capital cost but enabling more energy inventory to buffer price uncertainty. As shown in both case studies, there is an operational trade-off between risk and expected reward; this is reflected in higher expected costs (or lower expected profits) with increasing levels of risk aversion. Despite the decrease in expected reward, both systems exhibit substantial benefits of increasing risk aversion. This work provides a general method to address uncertainties in energy storage scheduling, allowing operators to input their level of risk tolerance on asset decisions.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Gu, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imran Pervez, Omar Knio</p>
            <p>We developed a new integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodology to predict context-aware unknown parameters in economic dispatch (ED), a crucial problem in power systems solved to generate optimal power dispatching decisions to serve consumer load. The ED formulation in the current study consists of load and renewable generation as unknown parameters in its constraints predicted using contextual information (e.g., prior load, temperature). The ILO framework train a neural network (NN) to estimate ED parameters by minimizing an application-specific regret function which is a difference between ground truth and NN-driven decisions favouring better ED decisions. We thoroughly analyze the feasible region of ED formulation to understand the impact of load and renewable learning together on the ED decisions. Corresponding to that we developed a new regret function to capture real-time electricity market operations where differences in predicted and true loads are corrected by ramping generators in real-time but at a higher cost than the market price. The proposed regret function when minimized using ILO framework train the NN to guide the load and renewable predictions to generate ED decisions favouring minimum generator ramping costs. This is unlike conventional sequential learning and optimization (SLO) framework which train NN to accurately estimate load and renewable instead of better ED decisions. The combined training of load and renewable using ILO is a new concept and lead to significantly improved ramping costs when compared with SLO based training of load and renewable and SLO trained load with 100% accurate renewable proving its decision-focused capability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S Krishna Niketh, Prasanta K Panigrahi, V Vignesh, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and 5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus systems.</p>

            <p>Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to the excellent performance of MFNN.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DER) into modern power systems introduces significant uncertainty, posing challenges for maintaining grid flexibility and reliability. Hybrid energy systems (HES), composed of controllable generators, flexible loads, and battery storage, offer a decentralized solution to enhance flexibility compared to single centralized resources. This paper presents a two-level framework to enable HES participation in frequency regulation markets. The upper level performs a chance-constrained optimization to choose capacity bids based on historical regulation signals. At the lower level, a real-time control strategy disaggregates the regulation power among the constituent resources. This real-time control strategy is then benchmarked against an offline optimal dispatch to evaluate flexibility performance. Additionally, the framework evaluates the profitability of overbidding strategies and identifies thresholds beyond which performance degradation may lead to market penalties or disqualification. The proposed framework also compare the impact of imbalance of power capacities on performance and battery state of charge (SoC) through asymmetric HES configurations.</p>

            <p>The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds, enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio. These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.</p>

            <p>The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.</p>

This paper proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user, while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Use-and-then-Forget (UatF) Bound: Fixed Point Algorithms for Statistical Max-Min Power Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renato Luis Garrido Cavalcante, Noor Ul Ain, Lorenzo Miretti, Slawomir Stanczak</p>
            <p>We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based power control algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</p>

            <h2>Distributed learning for automatic modulation recognition in bandwidth-limited networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narges Rashvand, Kenneth Witham, Gabriel Maldonado, Vinit Katariya, Aly Sultan, Gunar Schirner, Hamed Tabkhi</p>
            <p>Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques. However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around 41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers, the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach. These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of bandwidth-limited wireless networks.</p>

            <h2>Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sehyun Ryu, Hyun Jong Yang</p>
            <p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.</p>

            <h2>Aerial RIS-Enhanced Communications: Joint UAV Trajectory, Altitude Control, and Phase Shift Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Li, Dongdong Yang, Lei Liu, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS), we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies. Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance, achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.</p>

            <h2>A Digital Twin Framework for Decision-Support and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure in Localized Urban Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linh Do-Bui-Khanh, Thanh H. Nguyen, Nghi Huynh Quang, Doanh Nguyen-Ngoc, Laurent El Ghaoui</p>
            <p>As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments, optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction, energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios. Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW) solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible, computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to city-wide urban contexts.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Long-Term Joint Decarbonization Planning for Power Systems and Data Centers: A Case Study in PJM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Nanpeng Yu, Daniel Wong</p>
            <p>With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services, data centers have become critical infrastructures driving digital economies, with increasing energy demand heightening concerns over electricity use and carbon emissions, emphasizing the need for carbon-aware infrastructure planning. Most studies assume static power systems, focus only on operational emissions, and overlook co-optimization. This paper proposes a dynamic joint planning framework that co-optimizes long-term data center and power system development over 15 years. The model determines siting, capacity, and type of data centers alongside power generation expansion, storage deployment, and retirements, accounting for both operational and embodied emissions. To handle multi-scale uncertainty, a large-scale two-stage stochastic program is formulated and solved via an enhanced Benders decomposition. Applied to the PJM Interconnection, with curated datasets released on GitHub, results show the system can support up to 55 GW peak data center demand, with Virginia (DOM) and Northern Illinois (ComEd) as optimal hosts. Compared to non-joint planning, the framework cuts investment cost by 12.6%, operational cost by 8.25%, and emissions by 5.63%. Including lifecycle emissions further raises renewable deployment by 25.5%, highlighting embodied carbon's role in deeper decarbonization.</p>

            <h2>An OPF-based Control Framework for Hybrid AC-MTDC Power Systems under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongjin Du, Rahul Rane, Weijie Xia, Pedro P. Vergara, Aleksandra Lekić</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, introduces significant uncertainty into hybrid AC-HVDC systems due to forecast errors and power fluctuations. Conventional control strategies typically rely on fixed setpoints and neglect frequency deviations, which can compromise system stability under rapid renewable variations. To address this challenge, this paper presents a forecast-integrated, optimal power flow (OPF)-based adaptive control framework. Wind speed forecasts generated using a Random Forest model are incorporated into a time-coupled OPF to determine baseline converter setpoints in anticipation of wind fluctuations, which are further adjusted in real time based on actual operating conditions. An adaptive droop control scheme is developed that jointly considers DC voltage and AC frequency deviations. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, demonstrating its capability to ensure stable and robust operation of hybrid AC-HVDC systems under high penetration of renewable energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Bin Kwon, Sayak Mukherjee, Veronica Adetola</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</p>

            <h2>Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangong Chen, Xia Lei, Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Yuchen Zhang, Christos Masouros, Athina P. Petropulu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves' characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed. Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements, thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the actual target.</p>

            <h2>Maximal Load Shedding Verification for Neural Network Models of AC Line Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Chevalier, Duncan Starkenburg, Robert Parker, Noah Rhodes</p>
            <p>Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed. Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation, however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved via this http URL. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models which contain more than 10 million model parameters.</p>

            <h2>MDP-based Energy-aware Task Scheduling for Battery-less IoT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahab Jahanbazi, Mateen Ashraf, Onel L. A. López</p>
            <p>Realizing high long-term task completion rates represents a fundamental challenge in battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by ambient energy harvesting. This difficulty is primarily due to the stochastic and time-varying characteristics of the available energy, which significantly complicate the design of optimal task scheduling policies. In this paper, we consider a battery-less IoT device that must periodically report sensing measurements to a monitoring center. We adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to handle energy variability while aiming to maximize the long-term task completion rate. For this, we first identify its components and then define two appropriate reward functions. We demonstrate the inherent properties associated with the MDP formulation and the related optimal policy. Subsequently, we solve the resulting optimization problem, leading to the optimal stationary threshold-based (OSTB) scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that OSTB outperforms the well-known ``as late as possible'' (ALAP) scheduling strategy. For instance, an $8.6\%$ increase in the task completion rate, along with a $65\%$ reduction in power failures and a $86.29\%$ decrease in execution delays during task execution are registered assuming a $4.7$ mF capacitor.</p>

            <h2>Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Volt-VAR Optimization for Three-Phase Unbalanced Distribution Systems with Network Reconfiguration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Nanpeng Yu</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of intermittent distributed energy resources (DERs) has introduced significant variability in distribution networks, posing challenges to voltage regulation and reactive power management. This paper presents a novel neural two-stage stochastic Volt-VAR optimization (2S-VVO) method for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems considering network reconfiguration under uncertainty. To address the computational intractability associated with solving large-scale scenario-based 2S-VVO problems, a learning-based acceleration strategy is introduced, wherein the second-stage recourse model is approximated by a neural network. This neural approximation is embedded into the optimization model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling effective enforcement of operational constraints related to the first-stage decisions. Numerical simulations on a 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 50 times speedup compared to conventional solvers and decomposition methods, while maintaining a typical optimality gap below 0.30%. These results underscore the method's efficacy and scalability in addressing large-scale stochastic VVO problems under practical operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>A Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Approach to Real-Time Economic Dispatch with Multi-Transmission-Node DER Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Xianbang Chen, Nanpeng Yu</p>
            <p>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale electricity markets, as mandated by FERC Order 2222, imposes new challenges on system operations. To remain consistent with existing market structures, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP) represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED) framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors (DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis David Pabon Ospina, Martin Braun, Sushobhan Chatterjee, Sijia Geng</p>
            <p>Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</p>

            <p>The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a unified algebraic, topological, and logical framework for electrical one-port networks based on Šare's $m$-theory. Within this formalism, networks are represented by $m$-words (jorbs) over an ordered alphabet, where series and parallel composition induce an $m$-topology on $m$-graphs with a theta mapping $\vartheta$ that preserves one-port equivalence. The study formalizes quasi-orders, shells, and cores, showing their structural correspondence to network boundary conditions and impedance behavior. The $\lambda--\Delta$ metric, together with the valuation morphism $\Phi$, provides a concise descriptor of the impedance-degree structure. In the computational domain, the framework is extended with algorithmic procedures for generating and classifying non-isomorphic series-parallel topologies, accompanied by programmatic Cauer/Foster synthesis workflows and validation against canonical examples from Ladenheim's catalogue. The resulting approach enables symbolic-to-topological translation of impedance functions, offering a constructive bridge between algebraic representation and electrical realization. Overall, the paper outlines a self-consistent theoretical and computational foundation for automated network synthesis, classification, and formal verification within the emerging field of Jorbology.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid GNN-LSE Method for Fast, Robust, and Physically-Consistent AC Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Shamseldein</p>
            <p>Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust, iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR. The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution, while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for real-time operations and analysis.</p>

            <h2>Fair Cost Allocation in Energy Communities: A DLMP-based Bilevel Optimization with a Shapley Value Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongon Park, Kyuhyeong Kwag, Daniel K. Molzahn, Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Energy communities (ECs) are emerging as a promising decentralized model for managing cooperative distributed energy resources (DERs). As these communities expand and their operations become increasingly integrated into the grid, ensuring fairness in allocating operating costs among participants becomes a challenge. In distribution networks, DER operations at the community level can influence Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs), which in turn affect system's operation cost. This interdependence between local decisions and system-level pricing introduces new challenges for fair and transparent cost allocation. Despite growing interest in fairness-aware methods, most methods do not account for the impact of DLMPs. To fill this gap, we propose a bilevel optimization model in which a Community Energy Aggregator (CEA) schedules DERs across multiple ECs while a Distribution System Operator (DSO) determines DLMPs through network-constrained dispatch. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and strong duality, the bilevel model is reformulated into a tractable single-level problem. We achieve fairness in the cost allocation by applying the Shapley value to quantify each community's marginal contribution to system-wide cost savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations on several benchmark distribution systems.</p>

Using input-state data, we train neural networks to learn dissipativity-characterizing matrices that yield stabilizing controllers. Furthermore, we incorporate cost function shaping to improve the performance with respect to the user-specified objectives. Numerical results on a modified, all-VSG Kundur two-area power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiushi Wang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The rapid increase in renewable energy sources (RES) implementation in the power system creates more severe network congestion, which may reduce grid operation efficiency and cause renewable curtailment. Deterministic optimization for the unit commitment shows that battery energy storage system (BESS)-based Virtual Transmission Line (VTL), as an alternative to physical transmission lines, can offer a quick solution for congestion relief, reduced operational costs, and lowered renewable curtailment. This paper aims to evaluate the benefits of VTL when considering Renewable Energy Sources uncertainty. Particularly, this work proposes a scenario-based stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model considering VTL, referred to as SSCUC-VTL. It incorporates the forecast error of RES into the commitment decision for systems with VTL. The performance of applying the VTL strategy is compared to that of adding a new physical transmission line and a standalone BESS. A case study has been conducted on an enhanced IEEE 24-bus test system. The simulation results demonstrate that VTL provides 23% more operational cost reduction than the physical transmission line, and up to 67% more congestion relief than the standalone BESS in a power system with solar and wind generation.</p>

            <h2>Towards Stochastic (N-1)-Secure Redispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksii Molodchyk, Hendrik Drögehorn, Martin Lindner, Mario Kendziorski, Timm Faulwasser</p>
            <p>The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an (N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.</p>

            <p>Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</p>

            <h2>R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aladin Djuhera, Vlad C. Andrei, Xinyang Li, Ullrich J. Mönich, Holger Boche, Walid Saad</p>
            <p>Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</p>

            <h2>Exploiting Non-Diffracting Beams for Resilient Near-Field Millimeter-Wave Communications A Quantitative Roadmap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifeng Qin, Jing Chen, Zhi Hao Jiang, Zhining Chen, Yongming Huang</p>
            <p>Non diffracting (ND) beams are often cited as a promising solution to mitigate blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. However, a quantitative answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu) under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture. Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.</p>

            <h2>A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dixon Vimalajeewa, Ursula U. Muller, Brani Vidakovic</p>
            <p>Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying dynamics. We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.</p>

            <h2>A Connectively Stable and Robust DAPI Control Scheme for Islanded Networks of Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Saad Al-Karsani, Maryam Khanbaghi, Aleksandar Zečević</p>
            <p>The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are giving rise to the emergence of Microgrids (MGs) and Networks of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode. However, they face challenges in terms of secondary level frequency and voltage regulation, due to the variable nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and loads. Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control has been proposed in the literature for distributed frequency and voltage control of droop-controlled DERs, but it is not robust to operational or structural perturbations. To address this, we propose a robust DAPI frequency and voltage control scheme that ensures robustness using the concept of connective stability, along with the invariant ellipsoid technique for disturbance rejection. Simulation of an NMG model in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}/Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} consisting of 3 MGs and 5 DERs validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, and demonstrates that it can successfully mitigate the effects of major disturbances such as cyberattacks.</p>

            <h2>Environment-Dependent Components Identification of Behind-the-Meter Resources via Inverse Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengming Lyu, Zhenfei Tan, Xiaoyuan Xu, Chen Fu, Zheng Yan, Mohammad Shahidehpour</p>
            <p>With the increasing penetration of behind-the-meter (BTM) resources, it is vital to monitor the components of these resources and deduce their response behavior to external environment. Owing to data privacy, however, the appliance-wise measurement is invisible to the power system operator, which hinders the accurate modeling of load identification. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid physics-inspired and data-driven framework for decomposing BTM components based on external measurement of total load and environmental factors. The total load is decomposed into different environment-dependent components, namely storage-like component, PV generation component, thermostatically-controlled load component, and periodic component. The overall load identification adopts a double-layer iterative solution framework. A data-driven inverse optimization algorithm is developed to identify parameters of the energy storage-like component. The physics-inspired model is proposed to identify the capacity and response of the rest components. The modeling accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated by numerical tests. The application significance of the proposed BTM identification method is also validated in electricity market clearing for reducing system operation costs.</p>

            <h2>Green Hydrogen under Uncertainty: Evaluating Power-to-X Strategies Using Agent-Based Simulation and Multi-Criteria Decision Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik Wagner Madsen, Joy Dalmacio Billanes, Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen, Zheng Ma</p>
            <p>The transition toward net-zero energy systems requires scalable and cost-effective deployment of Power-to-X technologies, particularly green hydrogen production. Despite increasing investments, a critical research gap remains in dynamically assessing how different operational strategies affect the feasibility of hydrogen production under real-world energy market conditions. Most existing studies rely on static, techno-economic models and overlook actor interactions, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory complexity. This paper presents a novel modeling framework that integrates agent-based simulation with multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate green hydrogen production strategies using co-located wind and solar generation. Three operational strategies - grid-only, on-site-only, and hybrid - are applied across three electrolyzer capacity levels (10 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW) within a Danish case study. Real electricity tariffs, emissions factors, and market data are used to simulate technical, economic, and environmental performance indicators. The results show that hybrid strategies consistently outperform grid-only configurations in terms of cost and emissions while maintaining stable hydrogen output. Although on-site-only strategies minimize emissions and costs, they fail to meet fixed production demands. This framework offers novel scientific contributions by modeling dynamic actor interactions and integrating system performance evaluation into strategic planning. Practically, it provides actionable insights for energy planners and policymakers designing resilient and efficient Power-to-X systems in renewable-rich contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Bin Kwon, Sayak Mukherjee, Veronica Adetola</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuting Cai, Shaohuai Liu, Chao Tian, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fréchet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.</p>

            <p>Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in practice.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a multi-actor coordination platform for the optimal utilization of smart buildings resources, including roof top PV generation and battery energy storage system (BESS), in active power distribution systems. The proposed multi-actor coordination includes the Smart Building Coordinator (SBC), Micro-Grid Coordinator (MGC) and Distribution System Coordinator (DSC). The coordinators operate independently and only exchange limited information with each other to reach an optimal solution. In the proposed platform, a hierarchical optimization problem is solved to optimally determine the operating point of all distribution system resources. The proposed platform fully preserves the confidentiality of the behind the meter (BTM) data of the buildings since no information about the status of the PV system, BESS, and load of the building is shared with the owner of the power system. The proposed platform has a flexible and scalable architecture where the computational task of coordinating microgrids and smart buildings with distribution grid is performed locally at the MGC and SBC layers, respectively. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed platform in coordinating the BTM resources with the rest of the distribution system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Cifelli, Adolfo Anta</p>
            <p>The increasing share of converter based resources in power systems calls for scalable methods to analyse stability without relying on exhaustive system wide simulations. Decentralized small gain and small-phase criteria have recently been proposed for this purpose, but their applicability to grid forming converters is severely limited by the sectoriality assumption, which is not typically satisfied at low frequencies. This work revisits and extends mixed gain phase conditions by introducing loop shaping transformations that reformulate converter and network models in alternative coordinate frames. The proposed approach resolves intrinsic non sectoriality at low frequencies and reduces conservativeness, thereby improving the applicability of decentralized stability certification. Analytical results are illustrated using an infinite bus system first and then extended to the IEEE 14 bus network, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of the method. These findings provide a pathway toward less conservative and more widely applicable decentralized stability certificates in power grids.</p>

            <p>Training learning parameterizations to solve optimal power flow (OPF) with pointwise constraints is proposed. In this novel training approach, a learning parameterization is substituted directly into an OPF problem with constraints required to hold over all problem instances. This is different from existing supervised learning methods in which constraints are required to hold across the average of problem instances. Training with pointwise constraints is undertaken in the dual domain with the use of augmented Lagrangian and dual gradient ascent algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training with pointwise constraints produces solutions with smaller constraint violations. Experiments further demonstrated that pointwise constraints are most effective at reducing constraint violations in corner cases - defined as those realizations in which constraints are most difficult to satisfy. Gains are most pronounced in power systems with large numbers of buses.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliseo Curcio</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.</p>

            <p>Electrical grid congestion is a growing challenge in Europe, driving the need for accurate prediction of load, particularly of peak load. Non-time-resolved models of peak load offer the advantages of simplicity and compactness, and among them, Velander's formula (VF) is a traditional method that has been used for decades. Moreover, VF can be adapted into a quantile VF, which learns a truncated cumulative distribution function of peak load based on electricity consumption. This paper proposes a mathematical model based on extreme value theory to characterize the probability distribution of peak load for large non-residential customers. The model underpins the quantile VF as demonstrated through multiple quantile regression and reduces its representation to just four parameters without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, using maximum likelihood estimation and the likelihood ratio test, we validate that the probability distribution of peak load of analysed groups belongs to the heavy-tailed Fréchet class.</p>

The proposed graph analysis methods do not require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following changes in the system topology. The proposed methods eliminate the need for human intervention at any step of the fault location identification process. They are scalable and applicable to systems of any size.

It utilizes data collected by limited number of measuring devices installed in modern power distribution systems to systematically eliminate possible multiple fault location estimations to provide a single correct estimation of the actual location of the fault.

            <p>Operating fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces several challenges, some of which are borne by the fleet operator, and some of which are borne by the power grid. To maximize short-term profit a fleet operator could always charge EVs at the maximum rate to ensure vehicles are ready to service ride demand. However, due to the stochastic nature of electricity demand, charging EVs at their maximum rate may potentially increase the grid stress and lead to overall instability. Furthermore, high-rate charging of EVs can accelerate battery degradation, thereby reducing the service lifespan of the fleet. This study aims to reconcile the conflicting incentives of fleet longevity, short-term profitability, and grid stability by simulating a taxi fleet throughout its lifespan in relation to its charging policies and service conditions. We develop an EV fleet simulator to evaluate the battery degradation due to unpredictable charging and ride demand. Consequently, the impact on the power grid through the charging infrastructure is assessed due to these activities. This simulation utilizes publicly accessible real-world travel data from the NYC taxi dataset. We compare a baseline 80-20 fleet charging policy with a reinforcement learning-based policy designed to prolong the fleet's service life and alleviate grid stress. We monitor grid stress, battery degradation, and profitability over five years and find that our learned policy outperforms the baseline. This simulator enables fleet operators to assess the impact of different charging policies on these indicators to make informed decisions in the future.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Kron-based Reduction of Networks (Opti-KRON) for Three-phase Distribution Feeders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omid Mokhtari, Samuel Chevalier, Mads Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel structure-preserving, Kron-based reduction framework for unbalanced distribution feeders. The method aggregates electrically similar nodes within a mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem to produce reduced networks that optimally reproduce the voltage profiles of the original full network. To overcome computational bottlenecks of MIP formulations, we propose an exhaustive-search formulation to identify optimal aggregation decisions while enforcing voltage margin limits. The proposed exhaustive network reduction algorithm is parallelizable on GPUs, which enables scalable network reduction. The resulting reduced networks approximate the full system's voltage profiles with low errors and are suitable for steady-state analysis and optimal power flow studies. The framework is validated on two real utility distribution feeders with 5,991 and 8,381 nodes. The reduced models achieve up to 90% and 80% network reduction, respectively, while the maximum voltage-magnitude error remains below 0.003 p.u. Furthermore, on a 1000-node version of the network, the GPU-accelerated reduction algorithm runs up to 15x faster than its CPU-based counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Nodal Capacity Expansion Planning with Flexible Large-Scale Load Siting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomas Valencia Zuluaga, Simon Pang, Jean-Paul Watson</p>
            <p>We propose explicitly incorporating large-scale load siting into a stochastic nodal power system capacity expansion planning model that concurrently co-optimizes generation, transmission and storage expansion. The potential operational flexibility of some of these large loads is also taken into account by considering them as consisting of a set of tranches with different reliability requirements, which are modeled as a constraint on expected served energy across operational scenarios. We implement our model as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem with cross-scenario expectation constraints. To overcome the challenge of scalability, we build upon existing work to implement this model on a high performance computing platform and exploit scenario parallelization using an augmented Progressive Hedging Algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using the bounding features of mpisppy, which have shown to provide satisfactory provable optimality gaps despite the absence of theoretical guarantees of convergence. We test our approach to assess the value of this proactive planning framework on total system cost and reliability metrics using realistic testcases geographically assigned to San Diego and South Carolina, with datacenter and direct air capture facilities as large loads.</p>

            <h2>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale EV Smart Charging Considering Distribution Network Voltage Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stavros Orfanoudakis, Frans A. Oliehoek, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.</p>

            <p>Off-grid renewable power to ammonia (ReP2A) systems present a promising pathway toward carbon neutrality in both the energy and chemical industries. However, due to chemical safety requirements, the limited flexibility of ammonia synthesis poses a challenge when attempting to align with the variable hydrogen flow produced from renewable power. This necessitates the optimal sizing of equipment capacity for effective and coordinated production across the system. Additionally, an ReP2A system may involve multiple stakeholders with varying degrees of operational flexibility, complicating the planning problem. This paper first examines the multistakeholder sizing equilibrium (MSSE) of the ReP2A system. First, we propose an MSSE model that accounts for individual planning decisions and the competing economic interests of the stakeholders of power generation, hydrogen production, and ammonia synthesis. We then construct an equivalent optimization problem based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the equilibrium. Following this, we decompose the problem in the temporal dimension and solve it via multicut generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to address long-term balancing issues. Case studies based on a realistic project reveal that the equilibrium does not naturally balance the interests of all stakeholders due to their heterogeneous characteristics. Our findings suggest that benefit transfer or re-arrangement ensure mutual benefits and the successful implementation of ReP2A projects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amirhesam Aghanouri, Mohamed Sabry, Joshua Cherian Varughese, Cristina Olaverri-Monreal</p>
            <p>This paper presents an experimental investigation and performance evaluation of a hybrid electric radio-controlled car powered by a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery combined with a renewable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system. The study evaluates the performance of the system under various load-carrying scenarios and varying environmental conditions, simulating real-world operating conditions including throttle operation. In order to build a predictive model, gather operational insights, and detect anomalies, data-driven analyses using signal processing and modern machine learning techniques were employed. Specifically, machine learning techniques were used to distinguish throttle levels with high precision based on the operational data. Anomaly and change point detection methods enhanced voltage stability, resulting in fewer critical faults in the hybrid system compared to battery-only operation. Temporal Convolutional Networks were effectively employed to predict voltage behavior, demonstrating potential for use in planning the locations of fueling or charging stations. Moreover, integration with a solar-powered electrolyzer confirmed the system's potential for off-grid, renewable hydrogen use. The results indicate that integrating a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell with Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries significantly improves electrical performance and reliability for small electric vehicles, and these findings can be a potential baseline for scaling up to larger vehicles.</p>

            <h2>Carbon-Aware Orchestration of Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks via Digital Twin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shumaila Javaid, Nasir Saeed</p>
            <p>Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks (ISATNs) are envisioned as key enablers of 6G, providing global connectivity for applications such as autonomous transportation, Industrial IoT, and disaster response. Their large-scale deployment, however, risks unsustainable energy use and carbon emissions. This work advances prior energy-aware studies by proposing a carbon-aware orchestration framework for ISATNs that leverages Digital Twin (DT) technology. The framework adopts grams of CO$_2$-equivalent per bit (gCO$_2$/bit) as a primary sustainability metric and implements a multi timescale Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) loop that combines day-ahead forecasting with real-time adaptive optimization. ISATN-specific control knobs, including carbon-aware handovers, UAV duty cycling, and renewable-aware edge placement, are exploited to reduce emissions. Simulation results with real carbon intensity data show up to 29\% lower gCO$_2$/bit than QoS-only orchestration, while improving renewable utilization and resilience under adverse events.</p>

            <h2>DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient IRS-Assisted UAV Spectrum Sharing Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiheng Wang</p>
            <p>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems provide a new paradigm for reconfigurable and flexible wireless communications. To enable more energy efficient and spectrum efficient IRS assisted UAV wireless communications, this paper introduces a novel IRS-assisted UAV enabled spectrum sharing system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary network by jointly optimizing the beamforming, subcarrier allocation, IRS phase shifts, and the UAV trajectory subject to practical transmit power and passive reflection constraints as well as UAV physical limitations. A physically grounded propulsion-energy model is adopted, with its tight upper bound used to form a tractable EE lower bound for the spectrum sharing system. To handle highly non convex, time coupled optimization problems with a mixed continuous and discrete policy space, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the actor critic framework. Extended experiments show the significant EE improvement of the proposed DRL-based approach compared to several benchmark schemes, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach with mobility.</p>

            <p>Thyristor rectifiers (TRs) are cost-effective power supplies for hydrogen electrolyzers (ELZs) but introduce harmonic distortion that may violate grid codes. This letter proposes a self-governing harmonic mitigation strategy through coordinated operation of multiple ELZs in large power-to-hydrogen (P2H) plants. First, the harmonic model of TR-powered ELZs is derived, revealing a natural harmonic cancellation mechanism among them. Based on this, a system-level operation scheme based on phasor modulation is developed and integrated into plant scheduling. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces harmonic currents by 21.2%-39.7% and ensures grid-code compliance, with only a 0.25% loss in hydrogen output, while increasing total revenue by over 21\% compared to production-oriented strategies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijie Xia, Chenguang Wang, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Residential Load Profile (RLP) generation and prediction are critical for the operation and planning of distribution networks, especially as diverse low-carbon technologies (e.g., photovoltaic and electric vehicles) are increasingly adopted. This paper introduces a novel flow-based generative model, termed Full Convolutional Profile Flow (FCPFlow), which is uniquely designed for both conditional and unconditional RLP generation, and for probabilistic load forecasting. By introducing two new layers--the invertible linear layer and the invertible normalization layer--the proposed FCPFlow architecture shows three main advantages compared to traditional statistical and contemporary deep generative models: 1) it is well-suited for RLP generation under continuous conditions, such as varying weather and annual electricity consumption, 2) it demonstrates superior scalability in different datasets compared to traditional statistical models, and 3) it also demonstrates better modeling capabilities in capturing the complex correlation of RLPs compared with deep generative models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel O. Badmus, Peng Sang, Dimitrios Stamoulis, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</p>

            <h2>AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Hamza Ali, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p>

            <p>This research investigates designing a supervisory feedback controller for a hybrid power plant that coordinates the wind, solar, and battery energy storage plants to meet the desired power demands. We have explored an online feedback control design that does not require detailed knowledge about the models, known as feedback optimization. The control inputs are updated using the gradient information of the cost and the outputs with respect to the input control commands. This enables us to adjust the active power references of wind, solar, and storage plants to meet the power generation requirements set by grid operators. The methodology also ensures robust control performance in the presence of uncertainties in the weather. In this paper, we focus on describing the supervisory feedback optimization formulation and control-oriented modeling for individual renewable and storage components of the hybrid power plant. The proposed supervisory control has been integrated with the hybrid plant co-simulation engine, Hercules, demonstrating its effectiveness in more realistic simulation scenarios.</p>

            <p>The secure operation of power distribution systems is challenged by the growing integration of distributed energy resources. Leveraging the flexibility of battery storage offers a cost-effective alternative to measures like generation curtailment, which results in energy losses. However, developing an effective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid models, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power injections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex electrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in distribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are constructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage measurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation, enabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational complexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery storage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring secure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal constraints of battery storage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christoph Kaufmann, Georg Pangalos, Gerwald Lichtenberg, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a new approach to perform small-signal stability analysis based on linearization of implicit multilinear models. Multilinear models describe the system dynamics by multilinear functions of state, input, and algebraic variables. Using suitable transformations of variables, they can also represent trigonometric functions, which often occur in power systems modeling. This allows tensor representations of grid-following and grid-forming power converters. This paper introduces small-signal stability analysis of equilibrium points based on implicit multilinear models using generalized eigenvalues. The generalized eigenvalues are computed from linear descriptor models of the linearized implicit multilinear model. The proposed approach is tested using a 3-bus network example, first by comparing time-domain simulations of the implicit multilinear model with those of the nonlinear model, and second by comparing the generalized eigenvalues with those of the linearized nonlinear model. The results show that the decomposed tensor representation of the implicit multilinear model allows for a faster linearization compared to conventional methods in MATLAB Simulink.</p>

            <p>The power flow equations relate bus voltage phasors to power injections via the network admittance matrix. These equations are central to the key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation, protection, and fault location, among others). As control, optimization, and estimation of network admittance parameters are central to multiple avenues of research in electric power systems, we propose a linearization of power flow solutions obtained by implicitly differentiating them with respect to the network admittance parameters. This is achieved by utilizing the implicit function theorem, in which we show that such a differentiation is guaranteed to exist under mild conditions and is applicable to generic power systems (radial or meshed). The proposed theory is applied to derive sensitivities of complex voltages, line currents, and power flows. The developed theory of linearizing the power flow equations around changes in the complex network admittance parameters has numerous applications. We demonstrate several of these applications, such as predicting the nodal voltages when the network topology changes without solving the power flow equations. We showcase the application for continuous admittance control, which is used to increase the hosting capacity of a given distribution network.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources into the power grid, with often only black-box models available, challenges long-standing frequency control methods. Most recent works take a decentralized approach without online device coordination via communication. This paper considers both dynamic behavior and communication within secondary frequency control on an intermediate timescale. We develop a distributed data-driven approach that utilizes peer-to-peer communication between inverters to avoid the need for a central control center. To enable a trade off between communication network requirements and control performance, we present a framework to guide communication topology design for secondary frequency regulation. Following design of the inter-agent information exchange scheme, we design a controller that is structured according to the communication topology with a closed-loop stability guarantee. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the framework and illustrate the trade-off between communication requirements and control performance that is enabled by our approach.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution for Virtual Power Plant Communication: A Lightweight Key-Aware Scheduler with Provable Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>Virtual power plants (VPPs) are becoming a cornerstone of future grids, aggregating distributed PV, wind, storage, and flexible loads for market participation and real-time balancing. As operations move to minute-- and second--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to an operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly determine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time. Conventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain, high-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key yield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This paper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum keys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i) forecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware deficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and (iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled down-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis establishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with quantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable operating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus VPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with industry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and static-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and passive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and enhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.</p>

            <p>With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</p>

We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model.

            <p>The rapid decentralization and digitalization of local electricity markets have introduced new cyber-physical vulnerabilities, including key leakage, data tampering, and identity spoofing. Existing blockchain-based solutions provide transparency and traceability but still depend on classical cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Q-EnergyDEX, a zero-trust distributed energy trading framework driven by quantum key distribution and blockchain. The framework integrates physical-layer quantum randomness with market-level operations, providing an end-to-end quantum-secured infrastructure. A cloud-based Quantum Key Management Service continuously generates verifiable entropy and regulates key generation through a rate-adaptive algorithm to sustain high-quality randomness. A symmetric authentication protocol (Q-SAH) establishes secure and low-latency sessions, while the quantum-aided consensus mechanism (PoR-Lite) achieves probabilistic ledger finality within a few seconds. Furthermore, a Stackelberg-constrained bilateral auction couples market clearing with entropy availability, ensuring both economic efficiency and cryptographic security. Simulation results show that Q-EnergyDEX maintains robust key stability and near-optimal social welfare, demonstrating its feasibility for large-scale decentralized energy markets.</p>

Specifically, we integrate sparse optimization with method of moments (MoM) to make learning robust to a sparse distribution of data corruptions; then, we optimize sparse weights to identify corrupted meter locations. To improve inference speed on large-scale systems, we further adopt K-medoid clustering of locations to develop dimension reduction (DR) and aggregate representation (AR) heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate robustness against random large errors, targeted false data injections, and local PMU clock drifts. On a 1354-bus system, inference turns out to be 18x faster using DR and 400x faster when further combined with AR heuristics.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Key-Distribution Authenticated Aggregation and Settlement for Virtual Power Plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand-side flexibility has made virtual power plants (VPPs) central to modern grid operation. Yet their end-to-end business pipeline, covering bidding, dispatch, metering, settlement, and archival, forms a tightly coupled cyber-physical-economic system where secure and timely communication is critical. Under the combined stress of sophisticated cyberattacks and extreme weather shocks, conventional cryptography offers limited long-term protection. Quantum key distribution (QKD), with information-theoretic guarantees, is viewed as a gold standard for securing critical infrastructures. However, limited key generation rates, routing capacity, and system overhead render key allocation a pressing challenge: scarce quantum keys must be scheduled across heterogeneous processes to minimize residual risk while maintaining latency guarantees. This paper introduces a quantum-authenticated aggregation and settlement framework for VPPs. We first develop a system-threat model that connects QKD key generation and routing with business-layer security strategies, authentication strength, refresh frequency, and delay constraints. Building on this, we formulate a key-budgeted risk minimization problem that jointly accounts for economic risk, service-level violations, and key-budget feasibility, and reveal a threshold property linking marginal security value to shadow prices. Case studies on a representative VPP system demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces residual risk and SLA violations, enhances key efficiency and robustness, and aligns observed dynamics with the theoretical shadow price mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Techno-Economic Feasibility Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution for Power-System Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>The accelerating digitalization and decentralization of modern power systems expose critical communication infrastructures to escalating cyber risks, particularly under emerging quantum computing threats. This paper presents an integrated techno-economic framework to evaluate the feasibility of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure power-system communications. A stochastic system model is developed to jointly capture time-varying key demand, QKD supply under optical-loss constraints, station-side buffering, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) fallback mechanisms. Analytical conditions are derived for service-level assurance, including buffer stability, outage probability, and availability bounds. Building on this, two quantitative metrics, including the Levelized Cost of Security (LCoSec) and Cost of Incremental Security (CIS), are formulated to unify capital, operational, and risk-related expenditures within a discounted net-present-value framework. Using IEEE 118-bus, 123-node, and 39-bus test systems, we conduct discrete-event simulations comparing PQC-only, QKD-only, and Hybrid architectures across multiple topologies and service profiles. Results show that Hybrid architectures dominated by QKD significantly reduce key-outage probability and SLA shortfalls, achieving near-unit availability for real-time and confidentiality-critical services. Economic analyses reveal clear breakeven zones where QKD-enhanced deployments become cost-effective, primarily in metropolitan and distribution-level networks under moderate optical loss and buffer sizing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, risk-aware decision tool for guiding large-scale, economically justified QKD adoption in future resilient power-system infrastructures.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Dynamic Simulation of a Hybrid Wind-Wave System on a Hexagonal Semi-Submersible Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Bayat, Jerry Zuo, Jing Sun</p>
            <p>Offshore renewable energy systems offer promising solutions for sustainable power generation, yet most existing platforms harvest either wind or wave energy in isolation. This study presents a hybrid floating offshore platform that integrates a wind turbine with three oscillating surge wave energy converters (WECs) into a hexagonal semi-submersible structure. In this configuration, the flaps are integrated with the platform geometry to provide both energy extraction and hydrodynamic stability. A modeling and simulation framework was developed using WEC-Sim and benchmarked against the NREL 5 MW semisubmersible reference. Metacentric height analysis confirmed hydrostatic stability across a range of prescribed flap angles. Sensitivity analysis of twelve geometric variables identified flap dimensions and tower length as dominant drivers of stability, energy capture, and tower stress. Time-domain simulations revealed dependence on wave incidence angle, with variations in flap power sharing, capture width ratio (CWR), and platform response. The feasibility of using flap sweeps to modulate pitch motion was also demonstrated. Annual energy production (AEP) estimates based on site-specific data indicate 16.86 GWh from wind and 3.65 GWh from wave energy, with WECs contributing about 18% of the total. These results highlight the potential of integrated wind-wave platforms and point toward future studies on structural modeling and advanced control.</p>

            <h2>A Predictive Flexibility Aggregation Method for Low Voltage Distribution System Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clément Moureau, Thomas Stegen, Mevludin Glavic, Bertrand Cornélusse</p>
            <p>This paper presents a predictive control strategy to manage low-voltage distribution systems. The proposed approach relies on an aggregate of the flexibility at the residential unit level into a three-dimensional chart that represents the injected active and reactive power, and the flexibility cost. First, this method solves a multiparametric optimization problem offline at the residential unit level to aggregate the flexibility of the assets. Then, a semi-explicit model predictive control problem is solved to account for forecasts. By combining the results of these problems with measurements, the method generates the desired flexibility chart. The proposed approach is compatible with realtime control requirements, as heavy computations are performed offline locally, making it naturally parallelizable. By linking realtime flexibility assessment with energy scheduling, our approach enables efficient, low-cost, and privacy-preserving management of low-voltage distribution systems. We validate this method on a low-voltage network of 5 buses by comparing it with an ideal technique.</p>

            <h2>Cross-border offshore hydrogen trade and carbon mitigation for Europe's net zero transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheng Wang, Muhammad Maladoh Bah</p>
            <p>European countries are ambitious in both the net-zero transition and offshore energy resource development. The Irish and UK governments announced their commitments to offshore wind capacities - 37 and 125 GW, respectively, in 2050, more than two times higher than their projected power demands. While other continental countries, such as Germany, are calling for cleaner fuel resources. Exporting surplus offshore green hydrogen and bridging supply and demand could be pivotal in carbon emission mitigation for Europe. Yet, the potentials of these Island countries, are usually underestimated. This paper developed a bottom-up method to investigate the role of offshore hydrogen from Ireland and the UK in the decarbonisation of the entire Europe. We evaluate the future hydrogen/ammonia trading and the contributions of each country in carbon emission mitigation, considering their relative cost-competitiveness in offshore hydrogen production, domestic hourly power and gas system operation, and international shipping costs. Results indicate that the offshore green hydrogen could reduce 175.16 Mt/year of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. The UK will be the largest hydrogen supplier from 2030 to 2040, while surpassed by Ireland in 2050, with 161 TWh of hydrogen exports to France and Spain. The offshore green hydrogen can contribute to 175.16 Mt of annual carbon dioxide emission reductions in total. This general flow of hydrogen from the West to the East not only facilitates Europe's net-zero progress, but also reshapes the energy supply structure and helps to ensure energy security across the European continent.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Roh, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</p>

            <p>Many smart grid applications involve data mining, clustering, classification, identification, and anomaly detection, among others. These applications primarily depend on the measurement of similarity, which is the distance between different time series or subsequences of a time series. The commonly used time series distance measures, namely Euclidean Distance (ED) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), do not quantify the flexible nature of electricity usage data in terms of temporal dynamics. As a result, there is a need for a new distance measure that can quantify both the amplitude and temporal changes of electricity time series for smart grid applications, e.g., demand response and load profiling. This paper introduces a novel distance measure to compare electricity usage patterns. The method consists of two phases that quantify the effort required to reshape one time series into another, considering both amplitude and temporal changes. The proposed method is evaluated against ED and DTW using real-world data in three smart grid applications. Overall, the proposed measure outperforms ED and DTW in accurately identifying the best load scheduling strategy, anomalous days with irregular electricity usage, and determining electricity users' behind-the-meter (BTM) equipment.</p>

            <h2>Grid-Aware Real-Time Dispatch of Microgrid with Generalized Energy Storage: A Prediction-Free Online Optimization Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaidi Huang, Lin Cheng, Ning Qi, David Wenzhong Gao, Asad Mujeeb, Qinglai Guo</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel prediction-free two-stage coordinated dispatch framework for the real-time dispatch of grid-connected microgrid with generalized energy storages (GES). The proposed framework explicitly addresses grid awareness, non-anticipativity constraints, and the time-coupling characteristics of GES, providing microgrid operators with a near-optimal, reliable, and adaptable dispatch tool. In the offline stage, we generate the hindsight state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories of GES by solving the multi-period economic dispatch with historical scenarios. Subsequently, leveraging this historical information (SoC trajectories, net loads, and electricity prices), we synthesize and dynamically update online references for both SoC and opportunity cost through kernel regression. We propose an adaptive Lagrange multiplier-based online convex optimization algorithm, which innovatively incorporates reference tracking for global vision and expert-tracking for step-size updates. We provide theoretical proof to show that the proposed OCO algorithm achieves a sublinear bound of both dynamic regret and time-varying hard constraint violation. Numerical studies using ground-truth data from the Australian Energy Market Operator demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing operational costs by 5.0-6.2% and voltage violations by 0.8-9.1%. These improvements mainly result from mitigating myopia by reference tracking and the adaptive capability provided by dynamically updated references and adaptive Lagrange multipliers. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates the robustness, computational efficiency, and scalability of the proposed method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel O. Badmus, Peng Sang, Dimitrios Stamoulis, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</p>

            <h2>Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiadong Hong, Lei Liu, Xinyu Bian, Wenjie Wang, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
            <p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shimiao Li, Guannan Qu, Bryan Hooi, Vyas Sekar, Soummya Kar, Larry Pileggi</p>
            <p>Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data, topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large 2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.</p>

            <p>Existing or planned power grids need to evaluate survivability under extreme events, like a number of peak load overloading conditions, which could possibly cause system collapses (i.e. blackouts). For realistic extreme events that are correlated or share similar patterns, it is reasonable to expect that the dominant vulnerability or failure sources behind them share the same locations but with different severity. Early warning diagnosis that proactively identifies the key vulnerabilities responsible for a number of system collapses of interest can significantly enhance resilience. This paper proposes a multi-period sparse optimization method, enabling the discovery of {persistent failure sources} across a sequence of collapsed systems with increasing system stress, such as rising demand or worsening contingencies. This work defines persistency and efficiently integrates persistency constraints to capture the ``hidden'' evolving vulnerabilities. Circuit-theory based power flow formulations and circuit-inspired optimization heuristics are used to facilitate the scalability of the method. Experiments on benchmark systems show that the method reliably tracks persistent vulnerability locations under increasing load stress, and solves with scalability to large systems ({on average} taking {around} 200 s per scenario on 2000+ bus systems).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hoseinpour, Vladimir Dvorkin</p>
            <p>The optimal power flow (OPF) is a multi-valued, non-convex mapping from loads to dispatch setpoints. The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances, topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers, DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system benchmarks.</p>

To support growing demand and renewable energy integration, energy storage is emerging as a pivotal asset that provides temporal flexibility and alleviates congestion.

To ensure scalability, a trust-region, multicut Benders scheme warm-started from per-representative-day optima is proposed. Applied to a 2,000-bus synthetic Texas system under high-renewable projections, the method attains final optimality gaps below 1% and yields a plan with storage at about 180 nodes (32% of peak renewable capacity). These results demonstrate that the proposed PTDF-based methodology efficiently handles large distributed storage fleets, demonstrating scalability at high spatial resolution</p>

            <p>Integration of distributed energy resources has created a need for autonomous, dynamic voltage regulation. Decentralized Volt-VAr Control (VVC) of grid-connected inverters presents a unique opportunity for voltage management but, if designed poorly, can lead to unstable behavior when in feedback with the grid. We model the grid-VVC closed-loop dynamics with a linearized power flow approach, leveraging historical data, which shows improvement over the commonly used LinDistFlow model. This model is used to design VVC slopes by minimizing steady-state voltage deviation from the nominal value, subject to a non-convex spectral radius stability constraint, which has not been previously implemented within this context. We compare this constraint to existing convex restrictions and demonstrate, through simulations on a realistic feeder, that using the spectral radius results in more effective voltage regulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>To address growing cybersecurity challenges in modern power dispatch systems, this paper proposes a multi-layer modeling and optimization framework for SCADA systems enhanced with quantum key distribution (QKD). While most existing applications of QKD in the power sector focus on building secure point-to-point communication tunnels, they rarely consider the system-level coupling between key dynamics and control scheduling. In contrast, our approach integrates quantum key generation, consumption, inventory prediction, and control latency into a unified model, enabling key-aware reconfiguration of SCADA control chains based on task security demands and real-time resource constraints. To resolve conflicts in key resource allocation between transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution system operators (DSOs), we formulate a bi-level Stackelberg game and transform it into a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). We further develop an efficient Level Decomposition-Complementarity Pruning (LD-CP) algorithm to solve the problem. To support reproducible evaluation, we build an end-to-end co-simulation platform that integrates physical-layer disruptions via OpenQKD-Sim, Q3P/IEC-104 protocol stack binding, and real-time control-chain monitoring through Grafana. Experimental results on the IEEE 39- and 118-bus systems show that our method increases task success rate by 25%, reduces peak frequency deviation by 70%, and improves key utilization to 83%.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingrui Zhuang, Lin Cheng, Can Wan, Rui Xie, Ning Qi, Yue Chen</p>
            <p>Prediction deviations of different uncertainties have varying impacts on downstream decision-making. Improving the prediction accuracy of critical uncertainties with significant impacts on decision-making quality yields better optimization results. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes a novel weighted predict-and-optimize (WPO) framework for decision-making under multiple uncertainties. Specifically, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware weighting mechanism into the predictive model to capture the relative impact of each uncertainty on specific optimization tasks, and introduce a problem-driven prediction loss (PDPL) to quantify the suboptimality of the weighted predictions relative to perfect predictions in downstream optimization. By optimizing the uncertainty weights to minimize the PDPL, the proposed WPO framework enables adaptive assessment of uncertainty impacts and joint learning of prediction and optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate weight optimization, we develop a surrogate model that establishes a direct mapping between the uncertainty weights and the PDPL, where enhanced graph convolutional networks and multi-task learning are adopted for efficient surrogate model construction and training. Numerical experiments on the modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed WPO framework outperforms the traditional predict-then-optimize paradigm, reducing the PDPL by an average of 55% within acceptable computational time.</p>

            <p>We consider the problem of efficiently learning to play single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg games when the leader lacks knowledge of the lower-level game. Such games arise in hierarchical decision-making problems involving self-interested agents. For example, in electric ride-hailing markets, a central authority aims to learn optimal charging prices to shape fleet distributions and charging patterns of ride-hailing companies. Existing works typically apply gradient-based methods to find the leader's optimal strategy. Such methods are impractical as they require that the followers share private utility information with the leader. Instead, we treat the lower-level game as a black box, assuming only that the followers' interactions approximate a Nash equilibrium while the leader observes the realized cost of the resulting approximation. Under kernel-based regularity assumptions on the leader's cost function, we develop a no-regret algorithm that converges to an $\epsilon$-Stackelberg equilibrium in $O(\sqrt{T})$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on optimal pricing in electric ride-hailing markets.</p>

            <p>We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms, focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Ocean trials demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 700 meters while consuming only 10 watts of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- conditions that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</p>

            <p>At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Moreover, the lack of integrated solutions capable of simultaneously monitoring motor recovery and providing intelligent assistance in home environments hampers rehabilitation outcomes. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94\% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns during daily activities. An optional head-mounted eye-tracking module, together with ambient sensors such as cameras and microphones, supports seamless hands-free control of household devices with a 100\% success rate and sub-second response time. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, ensuring low latency and data privacy. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions -- issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increased mean user satisfaction from 3.9 $\pm$ 0.8 in conventional home environments to 8.4 $\pm$ 0.6 with the full system ($n=20$). Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable, patient-centered framework with potential for long-term use in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alistair Brash, Junyi Lu, Bruce Stephen, Blair Brown, Robert Atkinson, Craig Michie, Fraser MacIntyre, Christos Tachtatzis</p>
            <p>Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional power distribution network planning and operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjay Johnson, Dirk Lauinger, Sungho Shin, François Pacaud</p>
            <p>As GPU-accelerated mathematical programming techniques mature, there is growing interest in utilizing them to address the computational challenges of power system optimization. This paper introduces this http URL, an open-source modeling library for creating GPU-compatible nonlinear AC optimal power flow models. Built on this http URL, this http URL provides a high-level interface that automatically generates all necessary callback functions for GPU solvers. The library is designed for large-scale problem instances, which may include multiple time periods and security constraints. Using this http URL, we benchmark GPU and CPU solvers on open-source test cases. Our results show that GPU solvers can deliver up to two orders of magnitude speedups compared to alternative tools on CPU for problems with more than 20,000 variables and a solution precision of up to $10^{-4}$, while performance for smaller instances or tighter tolerances may vary.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Profit and CO2 Mitigation: Commercial Direct Air Capture Design and Operation with Power Market Volatility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Fan, Elizabeth Dentzer, James Glynn, David S. Goldberg, Julio Friedmann, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>Current decarbonization efforts are falling short of meeting the net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emission target, highlighting the need for substantial carbon dioxide removal methods such as direct air capture (DAC). However, integrating DACs poses challenges due to their enormous power consumption. This study assesses the commercial operation of various DAC technologies that earn revenue using monetized carbon incentives while purchasing electricity from wholesale power markets. We model four commercial DAC technologies and examine their operation in three representative locations including California, Texas, and New York. Our findings reveal that commercial DAC operations can take financial advantage of the volatile power market to operate only during low-price periods strategically, offering a pathway to facilitate a cost-efficient decarbonization transition. The ambient operational environment such as temperature and relative humidity has non-trivial impact on abatement capacity. Profit-driven decisions introduce climate-economic trade-offs that might decrease the capacity factor of DAC and reduce total CO2 removal. These implications extend throughout the entire lifecycle of DAC developments and influence power systems and policies related to full-scale DAC implementation. Our study shows that DAC technologies with shorter cycle spans and higher flexibility can better exploit the electricity price volatility, while power markets demonstrate persistent low-price windows that often synergize with low grid emission periods, like during the solar "duck curve" in California. An optimal incentive design exists for profit-driven operations while carbon-tax policy in electricity pricing is counterproductive for DAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Model predictive control lowers barriers to adoption of heat-pump water heaters: A field study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Levi D. Reyes Premer, Elias N. Pergantis, Leo Semmelmann, Davide Ziviani, Kevin J. Kircher</p>
            <p>Electric heat-pump water heaters (HPWHs) could reduce the energy costs, emissions, and power grid impacts associated with water heating, the second-largest energy use in United States housing. However, most HPWHs today require 240 V circuits to power the backup resistance heating elements they use to maintain comfort during large water draws. Installing a 240 V circuit can increase the up-front cost of a HPWH by half or more. This paper develops and field-tests the first control system that enables a 120 V HPWH to efficiently maintain comfort without resistance heating elements. The novel model predictive control (MPC) system enables pre-heating in anticipation of large water draws, which it forecasts using an ensemble of machine learning predictors. By shifting electrical load over time, MPC also reduces energy costs on average by 23% and 28% under time-of-use pricing and hourly pricing, respectively, relative to a 240 V HPWH with standard controls. Compared to the increasingly common practice in 120 V HPWHs of storing water at a constant, high temperature (60 °C) to ensure comfort, MPC saves 37% energy on average. In addition to demonstrating MPC's benefits in a real, occupied house, this paper discusses implementation challenges and costs. A simple payback analysis suggests that a 120 V HPWH, operated by the MPC system developed here, would be economically attractive in most installation scenarios.</p>

            <p>Electric vehicle (EV) public charging infrastructure planning faces significant challenges in competitive markets, where multiple service providers affect congestion and user behavior. This work extends existing modeling frameworks by incorporating the presence of competitors' stations and more realistic queueing systems. First, we analyze three finite queueing systems, M/M/1/K, M/M/s/K, and M/Er/s/K, with varying numbers of servers (charging outlets) and service time distributions, deriving analytic expressions for user behavior metrics. Second, we embed the queueing-based user behavior model into a bilevel program, where the upper level locates new charging stations to maximize accessibility (throughput), and the lower level captures users' station choices via a user equilibrium. Third, we apply a reformulation from competitive congested user-choice facility location models to approximately solve the bilevel problem and introduce a surrogate-based heuristic to enhance scalability. Fourth, we showcase our methodology on a real-world case study of an urban area in Montreal (Canada), offering managerial insights into how user-choice behavior assumptions and competition affect throughput and location decisions. The results demonstrate that our model yields (re)location strategies that outperform the existing network. More broadly, this approach provides a tool for incorporating charging service quality-through queueing metrics-and existing competition into station planning.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Best Candidates for Busbar Splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Bastianel, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun, Line Roald</p>
            <p>Rising electricity demand and the growing integration of renewables are intensifying congestion in transmission grids. Grid topology optimization through busbar splitting (BuS) and optimal transmission switching can alleviate grid congestion and reduce the generation costs in a power system. However, BuS optimization requires a large number of binary variables, and analyzing all the substations for potential new topological actions is computationally intractable, particularly in large grids. To tackle this issue, we propose a set of metrics to identify and rank promising candidates for BuS, focusing on finding buses where topology optimization can reduce generation costs. To assess the effect of BuS on the identified buses, we use a combined mixed-integer convex-quadratic BuS model to compute the optimal topology and test it with the non-linear non-convex AC optimal power flow (OPF) simulation to show its AC feasibility. By testing and validating the proposed metrics on test cases of different sizes, we show that they are able to identify busbars that reduce the total generation costs when their topology is optimized. Thus, the metrics enable effective selection of busbars for BuS, with no need to test every busbar in the grid, one at a time.</p>

            <h2>Decision-dependent Robust Charging Infrastructure Planning for Light-duty Truck Electrification at Industrial Sites: Scheduling and Abandonment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifu Ding, Ruicheng Ao, Pablo Duenas-Martinez, Thomas Magnanti</p>
            <p>Many industrial sites rely on diesel-powered light-duty trucks to transport workers and small-scale facilities, which has resulted in a significant amount of greenhouse emissions (GHGs). To address this, we developed a two-stage robust charging infrastructure planning model for electrifying light-duty trucks at industrial sites. The model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) that optimizes the charging infrastructure, selected from multiple charger types and potential locations, and determines opportunity charging schedules for each truck based on the chosen infrastructure. Given the strict stopping points and schedules at industrial sites, we introduced a scheduling problem with abandonment, where trucks forgo charging if their waiting times exceed a maximum threshold. We also further incorporated the impacts of overnight charging and range anxiety on waiting and abandonment behaviors. To represent the stochastic and heterogeneous parking durations of trucks, we constructed a decision-dependent robust uncertainty set in which parking time variability flexibly depends on charging choices. We applied the model in a case study of an open-pit mining site, which plans charger installations in eight zones and schedules a fleet of around 200 trucks. By decomposing the problem into monthly subproblems and using heuristic approaches, for the whole-year dataset, the model achieves an optimality gap of less than 0.1 % within a reasonable computation time under diverse uncertainty scenarios.</p>

            <h2>On the Flexibility Potential of a Swiss Distribution Grid: Opportunities and Limitations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Brändle, Julie Rousseau, Pulkit Nahata, Gabriela Hug</p>
            <p>The growing integration of distributed renewable generation and the electrification of heating and transportation are rapidly increasing the number of flexible devices within modern distribution grids. Leveraging the aggregated flexibility of these small-scale distributed resources is essential to maintaining future grid-wide stability. This work uses the Swiss distribution grid of Walenstadt as a case study to provide insights into the aggregated flexibility potential of distribution grids. It demonstrates that incorporating devices such as heat pumps and photovoltaic systems significantly enhances distribution grid flexibility. It investigates the time-varying nature of aggregated flexibility and highlights how it can vary seasonally. Furthermore, simulations of future scenarios reveal that aggregated flexibility does not increase linearly or monotonically with higher levels of flexible device penetration. This is primarily due to the overloading of individual feeders, which underscores the impact of grid topology and network constraints on the aggregated flexibility potential.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying the Impact of Missing Risk Markets for Decarbonized Power Systems with Long Duration Energy Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas C. Makrides, Adam Suski, Elina Spyrou</p>
            <p>The transition to a fully decarbonised electricity system depends on integrating new technologies that ensure reliability alongside sustainability. However, missing risk markets hinder investment in reliability-enhancing technologies by exposing investors to revenue uncertainty. This study provides the first quantitative assessment of how missing risk markets affect investment decisions in power systems that depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES) for reliability. We develop a two-stage stochastic equilibrium model with risk-averse market participants, which independently sizes power and energy capacity. We apply the method to a case study of a deeply decarbonised power system in Great Britain. The results show that incomplete risk markets reduce social welfare, harm reliability, and discourage investment in LDES and other technologies with volatile revenue streams. Revenue volatility leads to substantial risk premiums and higher financing costs for LDES, creating a barrier to its large-scale deployment. These findings demonstrate the importance of policy mechanisms that hedge revenue risk to lower the cost of capital and accelerate investment in reliability-enhancing, zero-carbon technologies</p>

            <h2>Learning Power Flow with Confidence: A Probabilistic Guarantee Framework for Voltage Risk</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parikshit Pareek, Sidhant Misra, Deepjyoti Deka</p>
            <p>The absence of formal performance guarantees in machine learning (ML) has limited its adoption for safety-critical power system applications, where confidence and interpretability are as vital as accuracy. In this work, we present a probabilistic guarantee for power flow learning and voltage risk estimation, derived through the framework of Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Specifically, we establish a bound on the expected estimation error that connects the GP's predictive variance to confidence in voltage risk estimates, ensuring statistical equivalence with Monte Carlo-based ACPF risk quantification. To enhance model learnability in the low-data regime, we first design the Vertex-Degree Kernel (VDK), a topology-aware additive kernel that decomposes voltage-load interactions into local neighborhoods for efficient large-scale learning. Building on this, we introduce a network-swipe active learning (AL) algorithm that adaptively samples informative operating points and provides a principled stopping criterion without requiring out-of-sample validation. Together, these developments mitigate the principal bottleneck of ML-based power flow-its lack of guaranteed reliability-by combining data efficiency with analytical assurance. Empirical evaluations across IEEE 118-, 500-, and 1354-bus systems confirm that the proposed VDK-GP achieves mean absolute voltage errors below 1E-03 p.u., reproduces Monte Carlo-level voltage risk estimates with 15x fewer ACPF computations, and achieves over 120x reduction in evaluation time while conservatively bounding violation probabilities.</p>

            <h2>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG is equipped with a local controller for voltage regulation and a distributed global controller for current sharing, where the local controllers ensure individual voltage tracking while the global controllers coordinate among DGs to achieve proportional current sharing. To design the distributed global controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions to enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated using existing convex optimization tools. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with the droop control algorithm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Bannmüller, Périne Cunat, Ali Rajaei, Jochen Cremer</p>
            <p>The ongoing energy transition places significant pressure on the transmission network due to increasing shares of renewables and electrification. To mitigate grid congestion, transmission system operators need decision support tools to suggest remedial actions, such as transmission network reconfigurations or redispatch. However, these tools are prone to model inaccuracies and may not provide relevant suggestions with regard to important unmodeled constraints or operator preferences. We propose a human-in-the-loop modeling-to-generate alternatives (HITL-MGA) approach to address these shortcomings by generating diverse topology reconfiguration alternatives. Case studies on the IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the method can leverage expert feedback and improve the quality of the suggested topology reconfigurations.</p>

            <p>Electricity distribution companies deploy battery storage to defer grid upgrades by reducing peak demand. In deregulated jurisdictions, such storage often sits idle because regulatory constraints bar participation in electricity markets. Here, we develop an optimization framework that, to our knowledge, provides the first formal model of market participation constraints within storage investment and operation planning. Applying the framework to a Massachusetts case study, we find that market participation could deliver similar savings as peak demand reduction. Under current conditions, market participation does not increase storage investment, but at very low storage costs, could incentivize deployment beyond local distribution needs. This might run contrary to the separation of distribution from generation in deregulated markets. Our framework can identify investment levels appropriate for local distribution needs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Efstratios Reppas, Ali Wadi, Brendan Gould, Kyriakos G. Vamvoudakis</p>
            <p>In this paper, we develop a framework for deception in quantum games, extending the Honey-X paradigm from classical zero-sum settings into the quantum domain. Building on a view of deception in classical games as manipulation of a player's perception of the payoff matrix, we formalize quantum deception as controlled perturbations of the payoff Hamiltonian subject to a deception budget. We show that when victims are aware of possible deception, their equilibrium strategies surprisingly coincide with those of naive victims who fully trust the deceptive Hamiltonian. This equivalence allows us to cast quantum deception as a bilevel optimization problem, which can be reformulated into a bilinear semidefinite program. To illustrate the framework, we present simulations on quantum versions of the Penny Flip game, demonstrating how quantum strategy spaces and non-classical payoffs can amplify the impact of deception relative to classical formulations.</p>

This extension enables accurate evaluation of the NLI in scenarios where conventional closed-form Gaussian Noise (GN) models are limited. The proposed model is validated against split-step Fourier method (SSFM) simulations and numerical integration across 41-161 channels, with a 96 GBaud symbol rate, bandwidths of up to 16.1 THz, and transmission distances from 80 to 800 km. Results show a mean absolute error of the NLI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 0.22 dB.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pål Forr Austnes, Matthieu Jacobs, Lu Wang, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Since the 1990s, widespread introduction of central (wholesale) electricity markets has been seen across multiple continents, driven by the search for efficient operation of the power grid through competition. The increase of renewables has made significant impacts both on central electricity markets and distribution-level grids as renewable power generation is often connected to the latter. These stochastic renewable technologies have both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand they offer very low marginal cost and carbon emissions, while on the other hand, their output is uncertain, requiring flexible backup power with high marginal cost. Flexibility from end-prosumers or smaller market participants is therefore seen as a key enabler of large-scale integration of renewables. However, current central electricity markets do not directly include uncertainty into the market clearing and do not account for physical constraints of distribution grids. In this paper we propose a local electricity market framework based on probabilistic locational marginal pricing, effectively accounting for uncertainties in production, consumption and grid variables. The model includes a representation of the grid using the lindistflow equations and accounts for the propagation of uncertainty using general Polynomial Chaos (gPC). A two-stage convex model is proposed; in the day-ahead stage, probability distributions of prices are calculated for every timestep, where the expected values represent the day-ahead (spot) prices. In the real-time stage, uncertainties are realized (measured) and a trivial calculation reveals the real-time price. Through four instructive case-studies we highlight the effectiveness of the method to incentivize end-prosumers' participation in the market, while ensuring that their behavior does not have an adverse impact on the operation of the grid.</p>

            <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.</p>

            <p>We propose a non-parametric frequency-domain method to identify small-signal $dq$-asymmetric grid impedances, over a wide frequency band, using grid-connected converters. Existing identification methods are faced with significant trade-offs: e.g., passive approaches rely on ambient harmonics and rare grid events and thus can only provide estimates at a few frequencies, while many active approaches that intentionally perturb grid operation require long time series measurement and specialized equipment. Although active time-domain methods reduce the measurement time, they either make crude simplifying assumptions or require laborious model order tuning. Our approach effectively addresses these challenges: it does not require specialized excitation signals or hardware and achieves ultrafast ($<1$ s) identification, drastically reducing measurement time. Being non-parametric, our approach also makes no assumptions on the grid structure. A detailed electromagnetic transient simulation is used to validate the method and demonstrate its clear superiority over existing alternatives.</p>

            <p>Wind power producers can benefit from forming coalitions to participate cooperatively in electricity markets. To support such collaboration, various profit allocation rules rooted in cooperative game theory have been proposed. However, existing approaches overlook the lack of coherence among producers regarding forecast information, which may lead to ambiguity in offering and allocations. In this paper, we introduce a ``reconcile-then-optimize'' framework for cooperative market offerings. This framework first aligns the individual forecasts into a coherent joint forecast before determining market offers. With such forecasts, we formulate and solve a two-stage stochastic programming problem to derive both the aggregate offer and the corresponding scenario-based dual values for each trading hour. Based on these dual values, we construct a profit allocation rule that is budget-balanced and stable. Finally, we validate the proposed method through empirical case studies, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and theoretical soundness.</p>

            <p>In the transition toward a sustainable power system, renewable-based Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) have emerged as a promising solution to the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources into electricity markets. Their viability, however, depends on effective market participation strategies and the ability to manage uncertainties while leveraging flexible resources. This paper analyzes the impact of different flexible resources - such as concentrated solar power plants, hydro plants, biomass plants, and flexible demand - on the participation of RVPPs in energy and reserve markets. Multiple sources of uncertainty in generation, consumption, and electricity prices are addressed using a two-stage robust optimization approach. The contribution of different technologies to RVPP profitability is evaluated through a marginal contribution method, ensuring fair allocation of profits among them according to their actual role in energy and reserve provision across markets. Simulations for an RVPP in southern Spain demonstrate how strategic decisions and the availability of flexible resources influence viability, market participation, and unit scheduling.</p>

A theoretical model is established to simulate phase error caused by linear birefringence from the quarter-wave plate. Conventional methods using circular birefringence are analyzed, revealing inherent limitations. Innovatively, a compensation strategy employing high-order quarter-wave plates is proposed to effectively eliminate linear birefringence effects. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and practicality of FOCS in precision metrology.</p>

            <h2>Latent-Feature-Informed Neural ODE Modeling for Lightweight Stability Evaluation of Black-box Grid-Tied Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jialin Zheng, Zhong Liu, Xiaonan Lu</p>
            <p>Stability evaluation of black-box grid-tied inverters is vital for grid reliability, yet identification techniques are both data-hungry and blocked by proprietary internals. {To solve this, this letter proposes a latent-feature-informed neural ordinary differential equation (LFI-NODE) modeling method that can achieve lightweight stability evaluation directly from trajectory data.} LFI-NODE parameterizes the entire system ODE with a single continuous-time neural network, allowing each new sample to refine a unified global model. It faithfully captures nonlinear large-signal dynamics to preserve uniform predictive accuracy as the inverter transitions between operating points. Meanwhile, latent perturbation features distilled from every trajectory steer the learning process and concurrently reveal the small-signal eigenstructure essential for rigorous stability analysis. Validated on a grid-forming inverter, {The LFI-NODE requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer training samples compared with traditional methods, collected from short time-domain trajectories instead of extensive frequency-domain measurements.} {Furthermore, the LFI-NODE requires only 48 short transients to achieve a trajectory prediction error at the hundredth level and an eigenvalue estimation error at the tenth level, outperforming benchmark methods by one to two orders of magnitude.} This makes LFI-NODE a practical and lightweight approach for achieving high-fidelity stability assessment of complex black-box power-electronic systems.</p>

            <p>Electric power systems are undergoing fundamental change. The shift to inverter-based generation challenges frequency stability, while growing digitalisation heightens vulnerability to errors and attacks. Here we identify an emerging risk at the intersection of cyber-physical coupling and control system design. We show that grid frequency time series worldwide exhibit a persistent one-minute oscillatory pattern, whose origin has remained largely unexplained. We trace this pattern back to the energy management systems of battery electric storage systems and demonstrate that the pattern amplitude has increased substantially in the Nordic and British grids. We argue that this effect is a potential burden for stability in future grids with low inertia and an increasing penetration with batteries and smart devices, though it can be mitigated by a revision of battery control algorithms.</p>

            <p>This article presents a study on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems using low-cost pyranometer sensors. The proposed approach integrates pyranometers, temperature sensors, and an ANN to estimate the duty cycle of a DC/DC converter, enabling the system to consistently operate at its maximum power point. The strategy was implemented in the local control of a Cuk converter and experimentally validated against the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) method. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based technique, leveraging affordable sensor technology, achieves accurate MPPT performance with reduced fluctuations, enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of PV tracking systems.</p>

            <h2>Transforming Tarlac State University (TSU) Gymnasium to a Nearly Zero-Energy Building through Integration of a Solar Photovoltaic (PV) System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael R. Yumul, Enalyn T. Domingo</p>
            <p>The study is anchored to the principles of Nearly-Zero Energy Building (NZEB). It aimed to transform the Tarlac State University Gymnasium into a facility with energy-efficient equipment to contribute to reducing carbon footprints by integrating a solar PV system as its renewable energy source. The researchers found out that the electrical infrastructure of the Gym was outdated, and the lighting was not energy efficient, and there were too few convenience or power outlets. There was also insufficient cooling equipment to maintain a comfortable temperature. Analysis shows that the payback period is within the average range, making it a cost-effective investment for the University. Aside from the cost of the PV System, adherence to engineering design standards will mean additional costs to replace the metal halides with LED high bay lamps, installation of additional air conditioning units, and provision of additional convenience outlets. These additional costs should be considered when evaluating the feasibility of the project. It is recommended that the integrity of the existing roof system of the Gymnasium be considered. The total cost of putting up the whole electrical system, including new lighting, cooling, and convenience loads, must be calculated to determine the total cost of implementing the whole NZEB project. Other factors in the economic evaluation may be considered to determine a more stringent result.</p>

            <h2>Aggregate Modeling of Air-Conditioner Loads Under Packet-based Control with Both On and Off Grid Access Requests</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Hassan, Mads R. Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) can engender flexibility necessary to improve grid reliability. Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is a method for coordinating DERs, such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) and electric vehicles, within customer quality-of-service (QoS) limits. In PEM, a DER uses local information to offer flexibility by sending a request to the DER coordinator to turn-ON or turn-OFF. Much work has focused on modeling and analyzing aggregations of DERs under PEM with fixed packet durations and only turn-ON requests. Different recent efforts to enable variable packet lengths have shown an increase in available flexibility and ramping capability, but have not been modeled in aggregate, which limits systematic analyses. To address this issue, this paper presents a new aggregate bin-based (macro) model of PEM loads that incorporates both turn-ON and turn-OFF request features, enabling the model to accurately characterize the capability of the fleet of DERs to track a power reference signal, population temperature dynamics, aggregate request rates, and variable packet lengths. Simulation-based validation is performed against an agent-based (micro) model to evaluate robustness and quantify model accuracy. Finally, the distribution of variable packet lengths from macro-model simulations are applied to inform past work on PEM with randomized packet lengths</p>

            <h2>Storage Participation in Electricity Markets: Arbitrage and Ancillary Services</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dirk Lauinger, Luc Coté, Andy Sun</p>
            <p>Electricity storage is used for intertemporal price arbitrage and for ancillary services that balance unforeseen supply and demand fluctuations via frequency regulation. We present an optimization model that computes bids for both arbitrage and frequency regulation and ensures that storage operators can honor their market commitments at all times for all fluctuation signals in an uncertainty set inspired by market rules. This requirement, initially expressed by an infinite number of nonconvex functional constraints, is shown to be equivalent to a finite number of deterministic constraints. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer bilinear program that admits mixed-integer linear relaxations and restrictions. Empirical tests on European electricity markets show a negligible optimality gap between the relaxation and the restriction. The model can account for intraday trading and, with a solution time of under 5 seconds, may serve as a building block for more complex trading strategies. Such strategies become necessary as battery capacity exceeds the demand for ancillary services. In a backtest from 1 July 2020 through 30 June 2024 joint market participation more than doubles profits and almost halves energy storage output compared to arbitrage alone.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: Integrating Public Charging Networks and Transportation Congestion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingbo Wang, Harshal D. Kaushik, Jie Zhang</p>
            <p>The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) represents a critical shift in personal mobility, fueled by policy support and advancements in automotive technology. However, the expansion of EVs for long-distance travel is hindered by charging time concerns, the sparse distribution of charging stations, and the worsening waiting times due to congestion. The main objective of this work is two-fold: 1) first, to comprehensively analyze the existing public charging station robustness and effectively strategize for the new ones, and 2) secondly, to select the optimal chargers for long-distance journeys, by estimating the waiting time from current traffic congestion. This is achieved by accompanying effective EV charging strategies, pinpointing on the congestion points from the existing traffic, and the robustness of the current charging station infrastructure. Utilizing a real-time transportation and charging station dataset in Texas, we identify optimal charger placement strategies to minimize travel time by examining the congestion and charging time trade-offs. Our findings suggest that maximizing the constant current phase during charging enhances efficiency, crucial for long-distance travel. On the contrary, we also explore the negative impact of congestion on travel times and we conclude that sometimes it might be beneficial to exceed the constant current phase to avoid the congested charging stations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Adel Attia, Jing Liu, Carol Espy Wilson</p>
            <p>Prior works have investigated the use of articulatory features as complementary representations for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but their use was largely confined to shallow acoustic models. In this work, we revisit articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.</p>

            <p>Detecting psychological stress from speech is critical in high-pressure settings. While prior work has leveraged acoustic features for stress detection, most treat stress as a static label. In this work, we model stress as a temporally evolving phenomenon influenced by historical emotional state. We propose a dynamic labelling strategy that derives fine-grained stress annotations from emotional labels and introduce cross-attention-based sequential models, a Unidirectional LSTM and a Transformer Encoder, to capture temporal stress progression. Our approach achieves notable accuracy gains on MuSE (+5%) and StressID (+18%) over existing baselines, and generalises well to a custom real-world dataset. These results highlight the value of modelling stress as a dynamic construct in speech.</p>

            <h2>Joint Detection, Channel Estimation and Interference Nulling for Terrestrial-Satellite Downlink Co-Existence in the Upper Mid-Band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shizhen Jia, Mingjun Ying, Marco Mezzavilla, Doru Calin, Theodore S. Rappaport, Sundeep Rangan</p>
            <p>The upper mid-band FR3 spectrum (7-24 GHz) has garnered significant interest for future cellular services. However, utilizing a large portion of this band requires careful interference coordination with incumbent satellite systems. This paper investigates interference from high-power terrestrial base stations (TN-BSs) to satellite downlink receivers. A central challenge is that the victim receivers, i.e., ground-based non-terrestrial user equipment (NTN-UEs) such as satellite customer premises equipment, must first be detected and their channels estimated before the TN-BS can effectively place nulls in their directions. We explore a potential solution where NTN-UEs periodically transmit preambles or beacon signals that TN-BSs can use for detection and channel estimation. The performance of this nulling approach is analyzed in a simplified scenario with a single victim, revealing the interplay between path loss and estimation quality in determining nulling performance. To further validate the method, we conduct a detailed multi-user site-specific ray-tracing (RT) simulation in a rural environment. The results show that the proposed nulling approach is effective under realistic parameters, even with high densities of victim units, although TN-BS may require a substantial number of antennas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omer Gokalp Serbetci, Lei Chu, Andreas F. Molisch</p>
            <p>Cognitive radio (CR) is an important technique for improving spectral efficiency, letting a secondary system operate in a wireless spectrum when the primary system does not make use of it. While it has been widely explored over the past 25 years, many common assumptions are not aligned with the realities of 5G networks. In this paper, we consider the CR problem for the following setup: (i) infrastructure-based systems, where downlink transmissions might occur to receivers whose positions are not, or not exactly, known; (ii) multi-beam antennas at both primary and secondary base stations. We formulate a detailed protocol to determine when secondary transmissions into different beam directions can interfere with primary users at potential locations and create probability-based interference rules. We then analyze the "catastrophic interference" probability and the "missed transmission opportunity" probability, as well as the achievable throughput, as a function of the transmit powers of the primary and secondary base stations and the sensing window of the secondary base station. Results can serve to more realistically assess the spectral efficiency gains in 5G infrastructure-based cognitive systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Fatih Ozkan, Dennis Kibalama, Jacob Paugh, Marcello Canova, Stephanie Stockar</p>
            <p>Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer significant potential for improving energy efficiency and lowering vehicle emissions through eco-driving technologies. Control algorithms in CAVs leverage look-ahead route information and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to optimize vehicle performance. However, existing eco-driving strategies often neglect macroscopic traffic effects, such as upstream traffic jams, that occur outside the optimization horizon but significantly impact vehicle energy efficiency. This work presents a novel Neural Network (NN)-based methodology to approximate the terminal cost within a model predictive control (MPC) problem framework, explicitly incorporating upstream traffic dynamics. By incorporating traffic jams into the optimization process, the proposed traffic-aware approach yields more energy-efficient speed trajectories compared to traffic-agnostic methods, with minimal impact on travel time. The framework is scalable for real-time implementation while effectively addressing uncertainties from dynamic traffic conditions and macroscopic traffic events.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Efficient Power Control in Single-User M-MIMO-OFDM System with PA Nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddarth Marwaha, Pawel Kryszkiewicz, Eduard A. Jorswieck</p>
            <p>Although multiple works have proposed energy-efficient resource allocation schemes for Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (M-MIMO) system, most approaches overlook the potential of optimizing Power Amplifier (PA) transmission power while accounting for non-linear distortion effects. Furthermore, most M-MIMO studies assume narrow-band transmission, neglecting subcarrier intermodulations at the non-linear PA for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, this work investigates the energy-efficient power allocation for a single-user equipment (UE) M-MIMO downlink (DL) system employing OFDM with nonlinear PAs. Unlike prior works, we model wide-band transmission using a soft-limiter PA model and derive a closed-form expression for the signal-to-distortion-and-noise ratio (SNDR) under Rayleigh fading and Maximal Ratio Transmission (MRT) precoding. Next, the Energy Efficiency (EE) function is defined considering two PA architectures and a distorted OFDM signal. We then propose a low complexity root-finding algorithm to maximize EE by transmit power adjustment. Simulation results demonstrate significant EE gains over a fixed PA back-off baseline, with over $100\%$ improvement under both low and high path loss. Our findings reveal how the optimal operating point depends on the antenna count, the PA model, and the propagation conditions.</p>

            <p>Maintaining high energy efficiency (EE) in wireless networks is crucial, particularly with the adoption of massive MIMO technology. This work introduces a resource allocation framework that jointly optimizes transmit power assigned to each user and the number of active antennas, while explicitly accounting for a nonlinear Power Amplifier (PA). We consider a downlink MU-MIMO-OFDM transmission with zero forcing (ZF) precoding, Rayleigh fading channels, and soft-limiter PAs, with both ideal and realistic PA architectures. In contrast to existing formulations, our optimization framework avoids imposing an explicit transmit power constraint, since the nonlinear distortion inherently limits the feasible operating region. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, an alternating optimization approach is adopted that, by exploiting properties of the EE function, guarantees convergence to a stationary point. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent performance gains over distortion-neglecting and power-only optimized baselines. In a scenario of a 5 km radius cell serving 60 randomly distributed users, the median EE gains over the distortion-neglecting allocation reach 40% for ideal PAs and 20% for Class B PAs, confirming high impact of the proposed solution.</p>

            <p>Ensuring both feasibility and efficiency in optimal power flow (OPF) operations has become increasingly important in modern power systems with high penetrations of renewable energy and energy storage. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as promising fast surrogates for OPF solvers, they often fail to satisfy critical operational constraints, especially those involving inter-temporal coupling, such as generator ramping limits and energy storage operations. To deal with these issues, we propose a Multi-Period Projection-Aware Deep Neural Network (MPA-DNN) that incorporates a projection layer for multi-period dispatch into the network. By doing so, our model enforces physical feasibility through the projection, enabling end-to-end learning of constraint-compliant dispatch trajectories without relying on labeled data.

            <p>With the increasing complexity of power systems,accurately identifying critical states (the states corresponding to minimal cut sets) and assessing system reliability have become crucial tasks. In this paper, a mathematical lattice structure is employed to represent and partition the state space of power system. Based on this structure, a novel recursive method is proposed to efffciently identify critical states by leveraging lattice partitioning and Optimal Power Flow(OPF) calculations. This method not only enables the extension of failure system states,but also calculates the upper and lower bounds of the Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) in a progressively converging manner. Compared to traditional reliability assessment methods such as State Enumeration (SE) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), this approach offers greater accuracy and efffciency. Experiments conducted on the RBTS and RTS79 systems demonstrate that the proposed method accurately identiffes all critical states up to a preset order, which are high-risk states. The contribution of these critical states to LOLP highlights their signiffcance in the system. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the analytical value with signiffcantly fewer OPF calculations in RBTS system, reaching acceptable precision of LOLP up to 100 times faster than SE in both the RBTS and RTS systems.</p>

            <p>Deep learning models have gained increasing prominence in recent years in the field of solar pho-tovoltaic (PV) forecasting. One drawback of these models is that they require a lot of high-quality data to perform well. This is often infeasible in practice, due to poor measurement infrastructure in legacy systems and the rapid build-up of new solar systems across the world. This paper proposes SolNet: a novel, general-purpose, multivariate solar power forecaster, which addresses these challenges by using a two-step forecasting pipeline which incorporates transfer learning from abundant synthetic data generated from PVGIS, before fine-tuning on observational data. Using actual production data from hundreds of sites in the Netherlands, Australia and Belgium, we show that SolNet improves forecasting performance over data-scarce settings as well as baseline models. We find transfer learning benefits to be the strongest when only limited observational data is available. At the same time we provide several guidelines and considerations for transfer learning practitioners, as our results show that weather data, seasonal patterns, amount of synthetic data and possible mis-specification in source location, can have a major impact on the results. The SolNet models created in this way are applicable for any land-based solar photovoltaic system across the planet where simulated and observed data can be combined to obtain improved forecasting capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee</p>
            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqi Ling, Minghui Liwang, Xianbin Wang, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Zhipeng Cheng, Sai Zou, Wei Ni, Xiaoyu Xia</p>
            <p>Timely resource allocation in edge-assisted vehicular networks is essential for compute-intensive services such as autonomous driving and navigation. However, vehicle mobility leads to spatio-temporal unpredictability of resource demands, while real-time double auctions incur significant latency. To address these challenges, we propose a look-ahead contract-based auction framework that shifts decision-making from runtime to planning time. Our approach establishes N-step service contracts between edge servers (ESs) using demand forecasts and modified double auctions. The system operates in two stages: first, an LSTM-based prediction module forecasts multi-slot resource needs and determines ES roles (buyer or seller), after which a pre-double auction generates contracts specifying resource quantities, prices, and penalties. Second, these contracts are enforced in real time without rerunning auctions. The framework incorporates energy costs, transmission overhead, and contract breach risks into utility models, ensuring truthful, rational, and energy-efficient trading.

            <h2>Nonlinear System Identification for Model-Based Control of Waked Wind Turbines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastiano Randino, Lorenzo Schena, Nicolas Coudou, Emanuele Garone, Miguel Alfonso Mendez</p>
            <p>This work presents a nonlinear system identification framework for modeling the power extraction dynamics of wind turbines, including both freestream and waked conditions. The approach models turbine dynamics using data-driven power coefficient maps expressed as combinations of compact radial basis functions and polynomial bases, parameterized in terms of tip-speed ratio and upstream conditions. These surrogate models are embedded in a first-order dynamic system suitable for model-based control. Experimental validation is carried out in two wind tunnel configurations: a low-turbulence tandem setup and a high-turbulence wind farm scenario. In the tandem case, the identified model is integrated into an adapted K\omega^2 controller, resulting in improved tip-speed ratio tracking and power stability compared to BEM-based and steady-state models. In the wind farm scenario, the model captures the statistical behavior of the turbines despite unresolved turbulence. The proposed method enables interpretable, adaptive control across a range of operating conditions without relying on black-box learning strategies.</p>

            <h2>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee</p>
            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingtao Yang, Zhenghe Guo, Siyun Liang, Zhaohui Yang, Chen Zhu, Zhaoyang Zhang</p>
            <p>This letter investigates the joint sensing problem between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and base stations (BS) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems with fluid antennas (FA). In this system, the BS enhances its sensing performance through the UAV's perception system. We aim to maximize the communication rate between the BS and UAV while guaranteeing the joint system's sensing capability. By establishing a communication-sensing model with convex optimization properties, we decompose the problem and apply convex optimization to progressively solve key variables. An iterative algorithm employing an alternating optimization approach is subsequently developed to determine the optimal solution, significantly reducing the solution complexity. Simulation results validate the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system performance.</p>

            <p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) are transforming power networks, challenging traditional operational methods, and requiring new coordination mechanisms. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SecuLEx (Secure Limit Exchange), a new market-based paradigm to allocate power injection and withdrawal limits that guarantee network security during time periods, called dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). Under this paradigm, distribution system operators (DSOs) assign initial DOEs to customers. These limits can be exchanged afterward through a market, allowing customers to reallocate them according to their needs while ensuring network operational constraints. We formalize SecuLEx and illustrate DOE allocation and market exchanges on a small-scale low-voltage (LV) network, demonstrating that both procedures are computationally tractable. In this example, SecuLEx reduces renewable curtailment and improves grid utilization and social welfare compared to traditional approaches.</p>

            <h2>Underground Power Distribution System Restoration Using Inverter Based Resources</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlong Shi, Hongyi Li, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Underground power distribution systems (PDSs) are increasingly deployed in urban areas. The integration of smart devices including smart switchgears, pad-mounted distribution transformers and inverter-based resources (IBRs) enhance system resilience, however simultaneously introducing unique challenges. The challenges include inrush currents caused by trapped charges in underground cables, ferroresonance in distribution transformers during energization, and three-phase load imbalance resulting from single-phase underground laterals. To address these issues, this paper proposes an underground PDS restoration framework using IBRs. Firstly, an underground cable energization model is developed to quantify inrush current by analyzing voltage differences across both switchgear terminals. Secondly, a distribution transformer energization model is proposed to evaluate ferroresonance using Q-factor constraints based on underground cable capacitance and damping resistance. Thirdly, a phase-swapping model is proposed to improve load balancing by dynamically reassigning lateral-phase connections through smart switchgears. The proposed models are further integrated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to maximize the total weighted restored load while constraining inrush currents, ferroresonance, and phase imbalance. To address the nonlinearity induced by impedance matrix reordering during phase swapping, a permutation-based linearization technique is proposed. Finally, case studies on an underground PDS established based on IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving uderground PDS restoration performance.</p>

            <h2>Learning to Mitigate Post-Outage Load Surges: A Data-Driven Framework for Electrifying and Decarbonizing Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlong Shi, Dingwei Wang, Liming Liu, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Electrification and decarbonization are transforming power system demand and recovery dynamics, yet their implications for post-outage load surges remain poorly understood. Here we analyze a metropolitan-scale heterogeneous dataset for Indianapolis comprising 30,046 feeder-level outages between 2020 and 2024, linked to smart meters and submetering, to quantify the causal impact of electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs) and distributed energy resources (DERs) on restoration surges. Statistical analysis and causal forest inference demonstrate that rising penetrations of all three assets significantly increase surge ratios, with effects strongly modulated by restoration timing, outage duration and weather conditions. We develop a component-aware multi-task Transformer estimator that disaggregates EV, HP and DER contributions, and apply it to project historical outages under counterfactual 2035 adoption pathways. In a policy-aligned pathway, evening restorations emerge as the binding reliability constraint, with exceedance probabilities of 0.057 when 30\% of system load is restored within the first 15 minutes. Mitigation measures, probabilistic EV restarts, short thermostat offsets and accelerated DER reconnection, reduce exceedance to 0.019 and eliminate it entirely when 20\% or less of system load is restored. These results demonstrate that transition-era surges are asset-driven and causally linked to electrification and decarbonization, but can be effectively managed through integrated operational strategies.</p>

            <p>Wind power producers (WPPs) participating in short-term power markets face significant imbalance costs due to their non-dispatchable and variable production. While some WPPs have a large enough market share to influence prices with their bidding decisions, existing optimal bidding methods rarely account for this aspect. Price-maker approaches typically model bidding as a bilevel optimization problem, but these methods require complex market models, estimating other participants' actions, and are computationally demanding. To address these challenges, we propose an online learning algorithm that leverages contextual information to optimize WPP bids in the price-maker setting. We formulate the strategic bidding problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit, ensuring provable regret minimization. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against various benchmark strategies using a numerical simulation of the German day-ahead and real-time markets.</p>

            <p>Foundation models have gained growing interest in the IoT domain due to their reduced reliance on labeled data and strong generalizability across tasks, which address key limitations of traditional machine learning approaches. However, most existing foundation model based methods are developed for specific IoT tasks, making it difficult to compare approaches across IoT domains and limiting guidance for applying them to new tasks. This survey aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of current methodologies and organizing them around four shared performance objectives by different domains: efficiency, context-awareness, safety, and security & privacy. For each objective, we review representative works, summarize commonly-used techniques and evaluation metrics. This objective-centric organization enables meaningful cross-domain comparisons and offers practical insights for selecting and designing foundation model based solutions for new IoT tasks. We conclude with key directions for future research to guide both practitioners and researchers in advancing the use of foundation models in IoT applications.</p>

We standardize text normalization and report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription, Conformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but are slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them attractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned for English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage.

            <p>Load forecasting has always been a challenge for grid operators due to the growing complexity of power systems. The increase in extreme weather and the need for energy from customers has led to load forecasting sometimes failing. This research presents a Support Vector Regression (SVR) framework for electric load forecasting that outperforms the industry standard. The SVR model demonstrates better accuracy across all evaluation metrics that are important for power system operations. The model has a 54.2\% reduction in Mean Squared Error (31.91 vs. 69.63), a 33.5\% improvement in Mean Absolute Error, and performance benefits across other metrics. These improvements show significant benefits when integrated with power forecasting tools and show that the approach provides an additional tool for accuracy checking for system planning and resource allocation in times of need for resource allocation in electric power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eren Berk Kama, Murat Babek Salman, Isaac Skog, Emil Björnson</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a sensing management method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Conventional communication systems employ channel estimation procedures that impose significant overhead during data transmission, consuming resources that could otherwise be utilized for data. To address this challenge, we propose a state-based approach that leverages sensing capabilities to track the user when there is no communication request. Upon receiving a communication request, predictive beamforming is employed based on the tracked user position, thereby reducing the need for channel estimation. Our framework incorporates an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based tracking algorithm with adaptive sensing management to perform sensing operations only when necessary to maintain high tracking accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed sensing management approach provides uniform downlink communication rates that are higher than with existing methods by achieving overhead-free predictive beamforming.</p>

            <h2>Towards Reliable Emergency Wireless Communications over SAGINs: A Composite Fading and QoS-Centric Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinong Chen, Wenchi Cheng, Jingqing Wang, Xiao Zheng, Jiangzhou Wang</p>
            <p>In emergency wireless communications (EWC) scenarios, ensuring reliable, flexible, and high-rate transmission while simultaneously maintaining seamless coverage and rapid response capabilities presents a critical technical challenge. To this end, satellite-aerial-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as a promising solution due to its comprehensive three-dimensional coverage and capability to meet stringent, multi-faceted quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Nevertheless, most existing studies either neglected the inherent characteristics of the complex channel conditions due to the terrain changes or analyzed the performance in the absence of QoS constraints, resulting in a mismatch between theoretical analysis and practical performance. To remedy such deficiencies, in this paper we establish a performance modeling framework for SAGIN employing the Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading model to characterize the air-ground link. In specific, the proposed $\mathcal{F}$ composite fading channel is adopted to accurately describe both multipath fading and shadowing in harsh ground environments. The exact distribution of end-to-end signal-to-noise (SNR) statistics for space-air and air-ground links is developed, enabling theoretical analysis of cascaded channels with fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols, respectively. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions of the derived results are provided to offer concise representations and demonstrate close alignment with theoretical predictions in the high-SNR regime. Finally, the insightful closed-form and asymptotic expressions of effective capacity with QoS provisioning, outage probability, and $\epsilon$-outage capacity are investigated, respectively, followed by both field measurements and Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effectiveness.</p>

            <h2>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Cross-Layer Authentication for Secure and Efficient Vehicular Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud A. Shawky, Syed Tariq Shah, Ahmed G. Abdellatif, Muhammad Ali Imran, Qammer H. Abbasi, Shuja Ansari, Ahmad Taha</p>
            <p>Intelligent transportation systems increasingly depend on wireless communication for broadcasting traffic messages and facilitating real-time vehicular communication. In this context, message authentication is crucial for establishing secure and reliable communication. However, security solutions must consider the dynamic nature of vehicular communication links, which fluctuate between line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight cross-layer authentication scheme that employs public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based authentication for initial legitimacy detection/handshaking while using key-based physical-layer re-authentication for message verification. This approach reduces signature generation and signaling overheads associated with each transmission, thereby enhancing network scalability. However, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC; Pd: detection vs. PFA: false alarm probabilities) of the latter decreases with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this, we investigate the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to strengthen the SNR directed toward the designated vehicle in shadowed areas (i.e., NLoS scenarios), thereby improving the ROC. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation are conducted using a 1-bit RIS consisting of 64 x 64 reflective meta-surfaces. Experimental results show a significant improvement in Pd, increasing from 0.82 to 0.96 at SNR = -6 dB for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system with 128 subcarriers. We also conducted informal and formal security analyses using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic to prove the scheme's ability to resist passive and active attacks.</p>

            <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that safeguards privacy by creating an impartial global model while respecting the privacy of individual client data. However, the conventional FL method can introduce security risks when dealing with diverse client data, potentially compromising privacy and data integrity. To address these challenges, we present a differential privacy (DP) federated deep learning framework in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we extend our similarity weight aggregation (SimAgg) method to DP-SimAgg algorithm, a differentially private similarity-weighted aggregation algorithm for brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our DP-SimAgg method not only enhances model segmentation capabilities but also provides an additional layer of privacy preservation. Extensive benchmarking and evaluation of our framework, with computational performance as a key consideration, demonstrate that DP-SimAgg enables accurate and robust brain tumor segmentation while minimizing communication costs during model training. This advancement is crucial for preserving the privacy of medical image data and safeguarding sensitive information. In conclusion, adding a differential privacy layer in the global weight aggregation phase of the federated brain tumor segmentation provides a promising solution to privacy concerns without compromising segmentation model efficacy. By leveraging DP, we ensure the protection of client data against adversarial attacks and malicious participants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>Synchronous Generators (SGs) currently provide important levels of Short-Circuit Current (SCC), a critical ancillary service that ensures line protections trip during short-circuit faults. Given the ongoing replacement of SGs by power-electronics-based generation, which have a hard limit for current injection, it has become relevant to optimize the procurement of SCC provided by remaining SGs. Pricing this service is however challenging due to the integrality constraints in Unit Commitment (UC). Existing methods, e.g., dispatchable pricing, restricted pricing and marginal unit pricing, attempt to address this issue but exhibit limitations in handling binary variables, resulting in SCC prices that either fail to cover the operating costs of units or lack interpretability. To overcome these pitfalls, we propose a primal-dual formulation of the SCC-constrained dispatch that preserves the binary nature of UC while effectively computing shadow prices of SCC services. Using a modified IEEE 30-bus system, a comparison is carried out between the proposed approach and the state-of-the-art pricing schemes, highlighting the advantages of the primal-dual method in preserving UC integrality for SCC pricing.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators a real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations, provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into power systems presents opportunities and challenges for ancillary services (AS) provision. Technical requirements of existing AS (i.e., duration, reliability, ramp rate, and lead time) have been designed for traditional generating units, making their provision by DER aggregates particularly challenging. This paper proposes a method to design the duration of reserve capacity AS products considering the operational constraints of DERs and the temporal dynamics of system imbalances. The optimal product duration is determined by maximizing product availability and aligning the supply profile with the system's balancing needs. We apply the methodology to a realistic Swiss low-voltage network with a diverse DER portfolio. The results reveal that (i) shorter product durations maximize average availability and (ii) long product durations improve the alignment with system balancing needs. This paper offers valuable insights for system operators to design AS products tailored for DER participation.</p>

However, due to the high computational cost for the decision-making, the conventional MPC-based EMS typically adopts a simplified integrated-bus power balance model.

This work proposes an efficient and reliable MPC-based EMS that incorporates power-loss effects and grid-security constraints. %, while adaptively shaping the battery power profile in response to online renewable inputs, achieving reduced operational costs. It enhances system reliability, reduces operational costs, and shows strong potential for online implementation due to its reduced computational effort. Specifically, a second-order cone program (SOCP) branch flow relaxation is integrated into the constraint set, yielding a convex formulation that guarantees globally optimal solutions with high computational efficiency. Owing to the radial topology of the microgrid, this relaxation is practically tight, ensuring equivalence to the original problem.

To the best of our knowledge, no prior MPC-EMS framework has simultaneously modeled losses and security constraints while coordinating flexible loads within a unified architecture.

            <p>The electrification of aircraft is reshaping the foundations of aerospace design by positioning electrical systems at the center of propulsion, control, and onboard functionality. This chapter provides an overview of electrical system architectures for electric and hybrid electric aircraft, highlighting both established principles and emerging design strategies. The discussion begins with the motivations for electrification, including reducing environmental impact, improving operational efficiency, and replacing complex pneumatic and hydraulic subsystems with lighter and more reliable electrical alternatives. Aircraft electrical architectures are classified into four major categories: conventional, more electric, all electric, and hybrid electric. A range of system topologies is examined, including direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), hybrid, and distributed configurations. Each is considered in terms of its effectiveness in delivering power, enabling redundancy, supporting fault isolation, and managing thermal performance. Real world examples are presented to demonstrate practical applications, with case studies drawn from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Eviation Alice commuter aircraft, and NASA X57 Maxwell demonstrator. These examples illustrate the ongoing transition from incremental subsystem electrification toward fully integrated architectures that promise higher efficiency and greater sustainability.</p>

This paper, for the first time, formulates a power limit prediction problem for eVTOL which explicitly considers long prediction horizons and the possible occurrence of emergency landings. We then harness machine learning to solve this problem in two intertwined ways. First, we adopt a dynamic model that integrates physics with machine learning to predict a lithium-ion battery's voltage and temperature behaviors with high accuracy. Second, while performing search for the maximum power, we leverage machine learning to predict the remaining discharge time and use the prediction to accelerate the search with fast computation. Our validation results show the effectiveness of the proposed study for eVTOL operations.</p>

            <h2>Cyber Resilience of Three-phase Unbalanced Distribution System Restoration under Sparse Adversarial Attack on Load Forecasting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Chao, Zixiao Ma, Ziang Zhang</p>
            <p>System restoration is critical for power system resilience, nonetheless, its growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI)-based load forecasting introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to infeasible planning, voltage and frequency violations, and unsuccessful recovery of de-energized segments, yet the resilience of restoration processes to such attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by quantifying how adversarially manipulated forecasts impact restoration feasibility and grid security. We develop a gradient-based sparse adversarial attack that strategically perturbs the most influential spatiotemporal inputs, exposing vulnerabilities in forecasting models while maintaining stealth. We further create a restoration-aware validation framework that embeds these compromised forecasts into a sequential restoration model and evaluates operational feasibility using an unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow formulation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more efficient and stealthier than baseline attacks. It reveals system-level failures, such as voltage and power ramping violations that prevent the restoration of critical loads. These findings provide actionable insights for designing cybersecurity-aware restoration planning frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Energy Management in Indoor Farming Using Lighting Flexibility and Intelligent Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammadjavad Abbaspour, Mukund R. Shukla, Praveen K. Saxena, Shivam Saxena</p>
            <p>Indoor farming enables year-round food production but its reliance on artificial lighting significantly increases energy consumption, peak load charges, and energy costs for growers. Recent studies indicate that plants are able to tolerate interruptions in light, enabling the design of 24-hour lighting schedules (or "recipes") with strategic light modulation in alignment with day-ahead pricing. Thus, we propose an optimal lighting control strategy for indoor farming that modulates light intensity and photoperiod to reduce energy costs. The control strategy is implemented within a model predictive control framework and augmented with transformer-based neural networks to forecast 24-hour ahead solar radiation and electricity prices to improve energy cost reduction. The control strategy is informed by real-world experimentation on lettuce crops to discover minimum light exposure and appropriate dark-light intervals, which are mathematically formulated as constraints to maintain plant health. Simulations for a one-hectare greenhouse, based on real electricity market data from Ontario, demonstrate an annual cost reduction of $318,400 (20.9%), a peak load decrease of 1.6 MW (33.32%), and total energy savings of 1890 MWh (20.2%) against a baseline recipe. These findings highlight the potential of intelligent lighting control to improve the sustainability and economic feasibility of indoor farming.</p>

            <h2>Power Reserve Capacity from Virtual Power Plants with Reliability and Cost Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Zapparoli, Blazhe Gjorgiev, Giovanni Sansavini</p>
            <p>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources is expected to drive higher demand for power reserve ancillary services (AS). One solution is to increase the supply by integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into the AS market through virtual power plants (VPPs). Several methods have been developed to assess the potential of VPPs to provide services. However, the existing approaches fail to account for AS products' requirements (reliability and technical specifications) and to provide accurate cost estimations. Here, we propose a new method to assess VPPs' potential to deliver power reserve capacity products under forecasting uncertainty. First, the maximum feasible reserve quantity is determined using a novel formulation of subset simulation for efficient uncertainty quantification. Second, the supply curve is characterized by considering explicit and opportunity costs. The method is applied to a VPP based on a representative Swiss low-voltage network with a diversified DER portfolio. We find that VPPs can reliably offer reserve products and that opportunity costs drive product pricing. Additionally, we show that the product's requirements strongly impact the reserve capacity provision capability. This approach aims to support VPP managers in developing market strategies and policymakers in designing DER-focused AS products.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Garcia-Aguilar, Aurelio Garcia-Cerrada, Juan L. Zamora, Emilio Bueno, Elena Saiz, Almudena Muñoz-Babiano, Mohammad E. Zarei</p>
            <p>The displacement of synchronous generators by converter-interfaced renewable energy sources obliges wind farms to provide inertia, damping, and voltage support, above all in increasingly weak grid conditions. This paper presents a co-ordinated frequency-domain methodology for tuning all control layers of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) within a wind farm operated as a Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM). Starting from a full small-signal linearisation that preserves loop-to-loop and machine-to-machine couplings, the procedure reshapes every local open loop to explicit phase-margin targets through a single, prioritised iteration. The resulting controllers provide a step response and stability margins close to those programmed at the design stage, in spite of the cross coupling between control loops. Since controller synthesis relies exclusively on classical loop-shaping tools available in commercial simulation suites, it is readily applicable to industrial-scale projects.</p>

            <h2>Conformalized Generative Bayesian Imaging: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Computational Imaging</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Canberk Ekmekci, Mujdat Cetin</p>
            <p>Uncertainty quantification plays an important role in achieving trustworthy and reliable learning-based computational imaging. Recent advances in generative modeling and Bayesian neural networks have enabled the development of uncertainty-aware image reconstruction methods. Current generative model-based methods seek to quantify the inherent (aleatoric) uncertainty on the underlying image for given measurements by learning to sample from the posterior distribution of the underlying image. On the other hand, Bayesian neural network-based approaches aim to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty on the parameters of a deep neural network-based reconstruction method by approximating the posterior distribution of those parameters. Unfortunately, an ongoing need for an inversion method that can jointly quantify complex aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty patterns still persists. In this paper, we present a scalable framework that can quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The proposed framework accepts an existing generative model-based posterior sampling method as an input and introduces an epistemic uncertainty quantification capability through Bayesian neural networks with latent variables and deep ensembling. Furthermore, by leveraging the conformal prediction methodology, the proposed framework can be easily calibrated to ensure rigorous uncertainty quantification. We evaluated the proposed framework on magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and image inpainting problems and showed that the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates produced by the proposed framework display the characteristic features of true epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the use of conformal prediction on top of the proposed framework enables marginal coverage guarantees consistent with frequentist principles.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces EmoSSLSphere, a novel framework for multilingual emotional text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that combines spherical emotion vectors with discrete token features derived from self-supervised learning (SSL). By encoding emotions in a continuous spherical coordinate space and leveraging SSL-based representations for semantic and acoustic modeling, EmoSSLSphere enables fine-grained emotional control, effective cross-lingual emotion transfer, and robust preservation of speaker identity. We evaluate EmoSSLSphere on English and Japanese corpora, demonstrating significant improvements in speech intelligibility, spectral fidelity, prosodic consistency, and overall synthesis quality. Subjective evaluations further confirm that our method outperforms baseline models in terms of naturalness and emotional expressiveness, underscoring its potential as a scalable solution for multilingual emotional TTS.</p>

Our findings demonstrate a fundamental connection between these two approaches.

This key equivalence not only explains the effectiveness of deterministic approaches in EIT but also corroborates the use of classical electromagnetic methods within this new discipline.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical Multi-Agent MCTS for Safety-Critical Coordination in Mixed-Autonomy Roundabouts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihao Lin, Shuo Liu, Zhen Tian, Dezong Zhao, Jianglin Lan, Chongfeng Wei</p>
            <p>Navigating unsignalized roundabouts in mixed-autonomy traffic presents significant challenges due to dense vehicle interactions, lane-changing complexities, and behavioral uncertainties of human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper proposes a safety-critical decision-making framework for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) navigating dual-lane roundabouts alongside HDVs. We formulate the problem as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process and develop a hierarchical safety assessment mechanism that evaluates three critical interaction types: CAV-to-CAV (C2C), CAV-to-HDV (C2H), and CAV-to-Boundary (C2B). A key contribution is our lane-specific uncertainty model for HDVs, which captures distinct behavioral patterns between inner and outer lanes, with outer-lane vehicles exhibiting $2.3\times$ higher uncertainty due to less constrained movements. We integrate this safety framework with a multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that employs safety-aware pruning to eliminate high-risk trajectories while maintaining computational efficiency. The reward function incorporates Shapley value-based credit assignment to balance individual performance with group coordination. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p>

            <h2>RTR: A Transformer-Based Lossless Crossover with Perfect Phase Alignment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangying Li, Jiankuan Li, Yong Tang</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a transformer-based lossless crossover method, termed Resonant Transformer Router (RTR), which achieves frequency separation while ensuring perfect phase alignment between low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) channels at the crossover frequency. The core property of RTR is that its frequency responses satisfy a linear complementary relation HLF(f)+HHF(f)=1. so that the original signal can be perfectly reconstructed by linear summation of the two channels. Theoretical derivation and circuit simulations demonstrate that RTR provides superior energy efficiency, phase consistency, and robustness against component tolerances. Compared with conventional LC crossovers and digital FIR/IIR filters, RTR offers a low-loss, low-latency hardware-assisted filtering solution suitable for high-fidelity audio and communication front-ends. The core theory behind this paper's work, lossless crossover, is based on a Chinese patent [CN116318117A] developed from the previous research of one of the authors, Jiankuan Li. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation of this theory and propose a new extension.</p>

            <p>Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) and dual-polarized SIM (DPSIM) enabled wave-domain signal processing have emerged as promising research directions for offloading baseband digital processing tasks and efficiently simplifying transceiver design. However, existing architectures are limited to employing SIM (DPSIM) for a single communication function, such as precoding or combining. To further enhance the overall performance of SIM (DPSIM)-assisted systems and achieve end-to-end (E2E) joint optimization from the transmitted bitstream to the received bitstream, we propose an SIM (DPSIM)-assisted E2E orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, in which traditional communication tasks such as channel coding, modulation, precoding, combining, demodulation, and channel decoding are performed synchronously within the electromagnetic (EM) forward propagation. Furthermore, inspired by the idea of abstracting real metasurfaces as hidden layers of a neural network, we propose the EM neural network (EMNN) to enable the control of the E2E OFDM communication system. In addition, transfer learning is introduced into the model training, and a training and deployment framework for the EMNN is designed. Simulation results demonstrate that both SIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems and DPSIM-assisted E2E OFDM systems can achieve robust bitstream transmission under complex channel conditions. Our study highlights the application potential of EMNN and SIM (DPSIM)-assisted E2E OFDM systems in the design of next-generation transceivers.</p>

            <p>In this paper, a functional weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm is proposed for downlink beamforming in multiuser continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems where both the base station (BS) and users employ CAPAs. The beamforming optimization problem in such systems is inherently functional. To address this challenge, we first employ an orthonormal basis expansion to transform the functional problem into a discrete formulation that shares the same structure as the conventional discrete multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) problem. By deriving the first-order optimality conditions of the discrete formulation and mapping them back to the functional domain, we obtain the update equations of the proposed functional WMMSE algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines in both spectral efficiency (SE) and computational complexity.</p>

            <h2>On Fast Attitude Filtering Using Matrix Fisher Distributions with Stability Guarantee</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijie Wang, Haichao Gui, Rui Zhong</p>
            <p>This paper addresses two interrelated problems of the nonlinear filtering mechanism and fast attitude filtering with the matrix Fisher distribution (MFD) on the special orthogonal group. By analyzing the distribution evolution along Bayes' rule, we reveal two essential properties that enhance the performance of Bayesian attitude filters with MFDs, particularly in challenging conditions, from a theoretical viewpoint. Benefiting from the new understanding of the filtering mechanism associated with MFDs, two closed-form filters with MFDs is then proposed. These filters avoid the burdensome computations in previous MFD-based filters by introducing linearized error systems with right-invariant errors but retaining the two advantageous properties. Moreover, we leverage the two properties and closed-form filtering iteration to prove the almost-global exponential stability of the proposed filter with right-invariant error for the single-axis rotation, which, to our knowledge, is not achieved by existing directional statistics-based filters. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed filters are significantly more accurate than the classic invariant Kalman filter. Besides, they are also as accurate as recent MFD-based Bayesian filters in challenging circumstances with large initial error and measurement uncertainty but consumes far less computation time (about 1/5 to 1/100 of previous MFD-based attitude filters).</p>

            <p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.</p>

The FS-HP rates are constructed using spectral regularization with qualification-controlled filters for flow predictors under standard source and filter assumptions. A multistep observability inequality links flow error to vector-field error and yields two-term bounds that combine a statistical rate with an explicit discretization bias from vLMM theory.

            <p>To effectively process impulse noise for narrowband powerline communications (NB-PLCs) transceivers, capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise (APIN) is a critical task. However, existing mathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics of noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train NGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise generation; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure the similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and practically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral cyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter; and 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the generated noise samples from the proposed NGGAN are highly close to the real noise samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plots and Fréchet inception distance (FID) analysis have shown that NGGAN outperforms other GAN-based models by generating noise samples with superior fidelity and higher diversity.</p>

To address this, we extend recent work developing fast, structure-exploiting, cached ADMM solvers for embedded applications, to provide support for second-order cones, as well as C++ code generation from Python, MATLAB, and Julia for easy deployment. Microcontroller benchmarks show that our solver provides up to a two-order-of-magnitude speedup, ranging from 10.6x to 142.7x, over state-of-the-art embedded solvers on QP and SOCP problems, and enables us to fit order-of-magnitude larger problems in memory.

Frequent handovers, complex beam alignment, and signal blockage from car bodies lead to service interruptions and degraded performance.

Wall-Street improves mobility management by (1) steering outdoor mmWave signals into the vehicle for shared coverage, enabling a single, collective handover decision for all users; (2) enabling neighbor-cell search without interrupting data transfer, allowing for seamless handovers; and (3) connecting users to a new cell before disconnecting from the old cell for reliable handovers. We have implemented and integrated Wall-Street in the COSMOS testbed and evaluated its real-time performance with multiple gNBs and users inside a surface-mounted vehicle, driving on a nearby road. In multi-UE scenarios, Wall-Street improves TCP throughput by up to 78% and reduces RTT by up to 34% over the standard 5G Standalone handover protocol.</p>

The energy consumption of the proposed circuits improves over the previous exact ones by 49%-75% and over the approximate full adders by up to 41%. Multiple error evaluation criteria evaluate the computational accuracy of the proposed approximate full adders in three scenarios in the 8-bit approximate adder structure. The proposed approximate full adders are evaluated in three image processing applications in three scenarios. The results of application-level simulation indicate that the four proposed circuits can be applied in all three scenarios, considering the acceptable image quality metrics of the output images.</p>

            <p>Developing tailored semiconductor heterostructures on demand represents a critical capability for addressing the escalating performance demands in electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, traditional fabrication methods remain constrained by simulation-based design and iterative trial-and-error optimization. Here, we introduce SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to perform multi-step semiconductor heterostructure growth through in-situ monitoring and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard MBE reactors, physics-informed machine learning (ML) models, and parameter initialization, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the optimization of high-density InAs quantum dot (QD) growth with a target emission wavelength of 1240 nm, showcasing the power of SemiEpi. We achieve a QD density of 5 x 10^10 cm^-2, a 1.6-fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and a reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV, leveraging in-situ reflective high-energy electron diffraction monitoring with feedback control for adjusting growth temperatures. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step heterostructure growth, facilitate the development of a hardware-independent framework, and enhance process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp del Hougne</p>
            <p>We recently introduced the "Virtual VNA" concept which estimates the $N \times N$ scattering matrix characterizing an arbitrarily complex linear reciprocal system with $N$ monomodal lumped ports by inputting and outputting waves only via $N_\mathrm{A}<N$ ports while terminating the $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ remaining ports with known tunable individual loads. However, vexing ambiguities about the signs of the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports remained. If only phase-insensitive measurements were used, an additional blockwise phase ambiguity ensued. Here, inspired by the emergence of "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" in wireless communications, we lift all ambiguities with at most $N_\mathrm{S}$ additional measurements involving a known multi-port load network. We experimentally validate our approach based on an 8-port chaotic cavity, using a simple coaxial cable as two-port load network. Endowed with the multi-port load network, the "Virtual VNA 2.0" is now able to estimate the entire scattering matrix without any ambiguity, even without ever measuring phase information explicitly. Potential applications include the challenging characterization of large and/or embedded antenna arrays.</p>

The quality of speech recognition directly impacts user experience and accessibility in technology-driven communication. This review paper explores advanced clustering techniques, particularly focusing on the Kernel Fuzzy C-Means (KFCM) method, to address these challenges. Our findings indicate that KFCM, compared to traditional methods like K-Means (KM) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), provides superior performance in handling non-linear and non-stationary noise conditions in speech signals. The most notable outcome of this review is the adaptability of KFCM to various noisy environments, making it a robust choice for speech enhancement applications. Additionally, the paper identifies gaps in current methodologies, such as the need for more dynamic clustering algorithms that can adapt in real time to changing noise conditions without compromising speech recognition quality. Key contributions include a detailed comparative analysis of current clustering algorithms and suggestions for further integrating hybrid models that combine KFCM with neural networks to enhance speech recognition accuracy. Through this review, we advocate for a shift towards more sophisticated, adaptive clustering techniques that can significantly improve speech enhancement and pave the way for more resilient speech processing systems.</p>

Five different models were trained on a pre-filtered dataset that was divided into fixed-length windows using a sliding window technique. Each window contained statistical measurements, FFT coefficients for different frequency bands, and a label identifying the activity carried out during that window that was taken from an open-source Kaggle repository. The XGBoost model outperformed the other models, CatBoost, GRU, SVC, and XGBoost, with an accuracy of 60%. The CatBoost model with a major difference between training and testing accuracy shows overfitting, and similarly, the best-performing model, with SVC, was implemented in a tkinter GUI. The wheelchair movement could be simulated in various directions, and a Raspberry Pi-powered wheelchair system for brain-computer interface is proposed here.</p>

            <h2>ProcTex: Consistent and Interactive Text-to-texture Synthesis for Part-based Procedural Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruiqi Xu, Zihan Zhu, Ben Ahlbrand, Srinath Sridhar, Daniel Ritchie</p>
            <p>Recent advances in generative modeling have driven significant progress in text-guided texture synthesis. However, current methods focus on synthesizing texture for single static 3D object, and struggle to handle entire families of shapes, such as those produced by procedural programs. Applying existing methods naively to each procedural shape is too slow to support exploring different parameter configurations at interactive rates, and also results in inconsistent textures across the procedural shapes. To this end, we introduce ProcTex, the first text-to-texture system designed for part-based procedural models. ProcTex enables consistent and real-time text-guided texture synthesis for families of shapes, which integrates seamlessly with the interactive design flow of procedural modeling. To ensure consistency, our core approach is to synthesize texture for a template shape from the procedural model, followed by a texture transfer stage to apply the texture to other procedural shapes via solving dense correspondence. To ensure interactiveness, we propose a novel correspondence network and show that dense correspondence can be effectively learned by a neural network for procedural models. We also develop several techniques, including a retexturing pipeline to support structural variation from procedural parameters, and part-level UV texture map generation for local appearance editing. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of procedural models validate ProcTex's ability to produce high-quality, visually consistent textures while supporting interactive applications.</p>

            <h2>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Lew</p>
            <p>We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snehal Raj, Brian Coyle</p>
            <p>Scaling full finetuning of large foundation models strains GPU memory and training time. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue via adapter modules which update only a small subset of model parameters. In this work, we introduce Quantum-Inspired Compound Adapters (QuIC Adapters), a PEFT approach inspired from Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits that can effectively finetune a model using less than 0.02\% memory footprint of the base model. QuIC adapters preserve pretrained representations by enforcing orthogonality in weight parameters, and have native deployment mechanisms on quantum computers. We test QuIC adapters by finetuning large language models like LLaMA and vision transformers on language, math, reasoning and vision benchmarks. In its first-order configuration, QuIC recovers the performance of existing orthogonal methods, while higher-order configurations enable substantial parameter compression (over 40x smaller than LoRA) for a modest performance trade-off, unlocking applications in highly resource-constrained environments. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant finetuning. Our findings suggest that QuIC adapters offers a promising direction for efficient finetuning of foundation models in resource-constrained environments.</p>

            <p>Inspired by REINFORCE, we introduce a novel receding-horizon algorithm for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem with unknown dynamics. Unlike prior methods, our algorithm avoids reliance on two-point gradient estimates while maintaining the same order of sample complexity. Furthermore, it eliminates the restrictive requirement of starting with a stable initial policy, broadening its applicability. Beyond these improvements, we introduce a refined analysis of error propagation through the contraction of the Riccati operator under the Riemannian distance. This refinement leads to a better sample complexity and ensures improved convergence guarantees.</p>

            <h2>Nonparametric adaptive payload tracking for an offshore crane</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Torbjørn Smith, Olav Egeland</p>
            <p>A nonparametric adaptive controller is proposed for crane control where the payload tracks a desired trajectory with feedback from the payload position. The controller is based on a novel version of partial feedback linearization where the unactuated crane load dynamics are controlled with the position of the actuated crane dynamics instead of the acceleration. This is made possible by taking advantage of the gravity terms in a new Cartesian model that we propose for the load dynamics. This Cartesian model structure makes it possible to implement a nonparametric adaptive controller which cancels disturbances on the crane load by approximating the effects of unknown disturbance forces and structurally unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). It is shown that the nonparametric adaptive controller leads to uniformly ultimately bounded errors in the presence of unknown forces and unmodeled dynamics. In addition, it is shown that the proposed partial feedback linearization based on the Cartesian model has certain advantages in payload tracking control also in the non-adaptive case. The performance of the nonparametric adaptive controller is validated in simulation and experiments with good results.</p>

            <h2>A Corrector-aided Look-ahead Distance-based Guidance for Online Reference Path Following with an Efficient Mid-course Guidance Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reva Dhillon, Agni Ravi Deepa, Hrishav Das, Subham Basak, Satadal Ghosh</p>
            <p>Efficient path-following is crucial in most of the applications of autonomous vehicles (UxV). Among various guidance strategies presented in literature, the look-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based nonlinear guidance has received significant attention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low cross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generating bounded lateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes problematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produces higher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high variation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of look-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance strategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized $L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV towards the vicinity of the start point of the reference path, while maintaining minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the vehicle reaches a close neighborhood of the reference path, a novel notion of corrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to generate the guidance command that effectively reduces the root mean square of the cross-track error and lateral acceleration requirement thereafter. Simulation results validate satisfactory performance of this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance strategy, along with the developed mid-course guidance scheme. Also, its superiority over the conventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme is established by simulation studies over different initial condition scenarios.</p>

            <p>The algorithms developed for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) are often challenging to test on actual vessels due to high operational costs and safety considerations. Simulations offer a cost-effective alternative and eliminate risks, but they may not accurately represent real-world dynamics for the given tasks. Utilizing small-scale model ships and robotic vessels in conjunction with a laboratory basin provides an accessible testing environment for the early stages of validation processes. However, designing and developing a model vessel for a single test can be costly and cumbersome, and researchers often lack access to such infrastructure. To address these challenges and enable streamlined testing, we have developed an in-house testbed that facilitates the development, testing, verification, and validation of MASS algorithms in a digital-physical laboratory. This infrastructure includes a set of small-scale model vessels, a simulation environment for each vessel, a comprehensive testbed environment, and a digital twin in Unity. With this, we aim to establish a full design and verification pipeline that starts with high-fidelity simulation models of each model vessel, to the model-scale testing in the laboratory basin, allowing possibilities for moving towards semi-fullscale validation with R/V milliAmpere1 and full-scale validation with R/V Gunnerus. In this work, we present our progress on the development of this testbed environment and its components, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling ship guidance, navigation, and control (GNC), including autonomy.</p>

            <p>Controlling singing style is crucial for achieving an expressive and natural singing voice. Among the various style factors, vibrato plays a key role in conveying emotions and enhancing musical depth. However, modeling vibrato remains challenging due to its dynamic nature, making it difficult to control in singing voice conversion. To address this, we propose VibESVC, a controllable singing voice conversion model that explicitly extracts and manipulates vibrato using discrete wavelet transform. Unlike previous methods that model vibrato implicitly, our approach decomposes the F0 contour into frequency components, enabling precise transfer. This allows vibrato control for enhanced flexibility. Experimental results show that VibE-SVC effectively transforms singing styles while preserving speaker similarity. Both subjective and objective evaluations confirm high-quality conversion.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iddo Yosha, Gallil Maimon, Yossi Adi</p>
            <p>Sentence stress refers to emphasis on words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea. It is often used to imply an underlying intention not explicitly stated. Recent speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct audio processing, allowing models to access the full richness of speech to perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of SLMs. We address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to distinguish between meanings of speech based on the stress pattern. We evaluate leading SLMs, and find that despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. Hence, we propose a novel data generation pipeline, and create Stress-17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, generalizes well to real recordings and notably outperforms existing SLMs on sentence stress reasoning and detection.

            <p>Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to encode temporal and identity information. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.</p>

            <p>The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Alikhani, Reza Kazemi</p>
            <p>In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyberattack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, the rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to effectively distinguish between normal and attack behaviors. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships, along with its learnable activation functions, is also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and the potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety, critical environments where reliability is paramount.</p>

            <p>Music recordings often suffer from audio quality issues such as excessive reverberation, distortion, clipping, tonal imbalances, and a narrowed stereo image, especially when created in non-professional settings without specialized equipment or expertise. These problems are typically corrected using separate specialized tools and manual adjustments. In this paper, we introduce SonicMaster, the first unified generative model for music restoration and mastering that addresses a broad spectrum of audio artifacts with text-based control. SonicMaster is conditioned on natural language instructions to apply targeted enhancements, or can operate in an automatic mode for general restoration. To train this model, we construct the SonicMaster dataset, a large dataset of paired degraded and high-quality tracks by simulating common degradation types with nineteen degradation functions belonging to five enhancements groups: equalization, dynamics, reverb, amplitude, and stereo. Our approach leverages a flow-matching generative training paradigm to learn an audio transformation that maps degraded inputs to their cleaned, mastered versions guided by text prompts. Objective audio quality metrics demonstrate that SonicMaster significantly improves sound quality across all artifact categories. Furthermore, subjective listening tests confirm that listeners prefer SonicMaster's enhanced outputs over the original degraded audio, highlighting the effectiveness of our unified approach.</p>

            <p>In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we present Fun-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, Fun-ASR is specifically optimized for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks, they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to production-oriented optimizations, Fun-ASR achieves state-of-the-art performance on real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical settings.</p>

            <p>We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p>

            <p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image and audio generation, largely due to Classifier-Free Guidance. However, the choice of guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference. Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity, alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained diffusion backbones.</p>

The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that although most multilingual ASR models initially exhibit inadequate CS-ASR performance, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with synthetic CS data.

            <h2>TalkPlay-Tools: Conversational Music Recommendation with LLM Tool Calling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungheon Doh, Keunwoo Choi, Juhan Nam</p>
            <p>While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components: boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning, the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm for conversational music recommendation systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust MPC for Large-scale Linear Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Schildbach</p>
            <p>State-of-the-art approaches of Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) are restricted to linear systems of relatively small scale, i.e., with no more than about 5 states. The main reason is the computational burden of determining a robust positively invariant (RPI) set, whose complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The recently proposed approach of Deadbeat Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC) is the first that does not rely on an RPI set. Yet it comes with the full set of essential system theoretic guarantees. DRMPC is hence a viable option, in particular, for large-scale systems. This paper introduces a detailed design procedure for DRMPC. It is shown that the optimal control problem generated for DRMPC has exactly the same computational complexity as Nominal MPC. A numerical study validates its applicability to randomly generated large-scale linear systems of various dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Automated Defect Detection for Mass-Produced Electronic Components Based on YOLO Object Detection Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Lung Mao, Chun-Chi Wang, Po-Heng Chou, Yen-Ting Liu</p>
            <p>Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.</p>

            <h2>An Encoder-Decoder Network for Beamforming over Sparse Large-Scale MIMO Channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Zhang, Jeremy Johnston, Xiaodong Wang</p>
            <p>We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.</p>

            <h2>Power Distribution System Blackstart Restoration Using Renewable Energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlong Shi, Hongyi Li, Cong Bai, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Integrating renewable energy sources into the grid not only reduces global carbon emissions, but also facilitates distribution system (DS) blackstart restoration. This process leverages renewable energy, inverters, situational awareness and distribution automation to initiate blackstart at the DS level, obtaining a fast response and bottom-up restoration. In this Review, we survey the latest technological advances for DS blackstart restoration using renewable energy. We first present mathematical models for distributed energy resources (DERs), network topology, and load dynamics. We then discuss how the situational awareness can help improve restoration performance through real-time monitoring and forecasting. Next, the DS blackstart restoration problem, including objectives, constraints, and existing methodologies for decision-making are provided. Lastly, we outline remaining challenges, and highlight the opportunities and future research directions.</p>

            <h2>Situationally Aware Rolling Horizon Multi-Tier Load Restoration Considering Behind-The-Meter DER</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenlong Shi, Junyuan Zheng, Zhaoyu Wang</p>
            <p>Restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is well studied, however, most existing research focuses on network partition and microgrid formation, where load transfer is limited to adjacent feeders. This focus is not practical, as when adjacent feeders lack sufficient capacity, utilities may request support from more distant feeders in practice. Such a hirarchical restoration is complex, especially when involving changing system conditions due to cold load pickup and delayed reconnection of behind-the-meter DERs. To fill this research gap, a situationally aware multi-tier load restoration framework is proposed. Specifically, models are proposed to describe the multi-tier load restoration, including the multi-tier load transfer and substation transformer and feeder protection models. By introducing binary actional switching variables and load block transfer variables, the models effectively captures the dynamics of switches and multi-tier transfer process. To integrate situational awareness of evolving system conditions, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and then embedded within a rolling horizon optimization. Particularly, a set of safeguarded constraints are developed based on segment-level restoration reward bounds to mitigate the myopia of traditional rolling horizon optimization. The proposed safeguarded rolling strategy guarantees that each time step is lower bounded by a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of its optimal restoration potential, thereby balancing short-term switching decisions with long-term restoration goals. Finally, cases studies on the modified IEEE 123-node test feeder validate the proposed multi-tier restoration framework.</p>

            <h2>A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Adversarial Control of Gas Pipeline Operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tejaswini Sanjay Katale, Lu Gao, Yunpeng Zhang, Alaa Senouci</p>
            <p>Cyberattacks on pipeline operational technology systems pose growing risks to energy infrastructure. This study develops a physics-informed simulation and optimization framework for analyzing cyber-physical threats in petroleum pipeline networks. The model integrates networked hydraulic dynamics, SCADA-based state estimation, model predictive control (MPC), and a bi-level formulation for stealthy false-data injection (FDI) attacks. Pipeline flow and pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bassel Diban, Giovanni Mazzanti</p>
            <p>This paper goes one step forward in the life estimation of HVDC cable insulation under load cycles by introducing for the first time a microscopic model of charge conduction and transport i.e., Bipolar Charge Transport BCT model for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that found in literature. Then, the parameters of the developed BCT model are optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic PEA space charge measurements. Followed by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure 852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models already found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable electric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior of the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling load cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different amplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This investigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research project.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Multi-Microgrids: Improved Double Auction Mechanism and Prediction-Free Online Trading Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaidi Huang, Lin Cheng, Yue Zhou, Fashun Shi, Yufei Xi, Yingrui Zhuang, Ning Qi</p>
            <p>Peer-to-peer energy trading offers a promising solution for enhancing renewable energy utilization and economic benefits within interconnected microgrids. However, existing real-time P2P markets face two key challenges: high computational complexity in trading mechanisms, and suboptimal participant decision-making under diverse uncertainties. Existing prediction-based decision-making methods rely heavily on accurate forecasts, which are typically unavailable for microgrids, while prediction-free methods suffer from myopic behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved double auction mechanism combined with an adaptive step-size search algorithm to reduce computational burden, and a data-driven dual-reference online optimization (DDOO) framework to enhance participant decision-making. The improved mechanism simplifies bidding procedures, significantly reducing computational burden and ensuring rapid convergence to the market equilibrium. Additionally, the prediction-free DDOO framework mitigates myopic decision-making by introducing two informative reference signals. Case studies on a 20-microgrid system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed mechanism and approach. The improved mechanism significantly decreases the computational time while increasing local energy self-sufficiency periods from 0.01% to 29.86%, reducing reverse power flow periods from 24.51% to 3.96%, and lowering average operating costs by 19.20%. Compared with conventional approaches such as Lyapunov optimization and model predictive control, the DDOO framework achieves a 10%-13% reduction in operating costs with an optimality gap of only 5.76%.</p>

            <p>Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanhua Tan, Beixiong Zheng, Yi Fang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Jie Xu, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) technology has recently drawn significant attention in wireless systems owing to its unique ability to exploit additional spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by dynamically adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna. In this letter, we propose a new RA-assisted cognitive radio (CR) system designed to achieve efficient spectrum sharing while mitigating interference between primary and secondary communication links. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem for the joint design of the transmit beamforming and the boresight directions of RAs at the secondary transmitter (ST), aimed at maximizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver (SR), while satisfying both interference constraint at the primary receiver (PR) and the maximum transmit power constraint at the ST. Although the formulated problem is challenging to solve due to its non-convexity and coupled variables, we develop an efficient algorithm by leveraging alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to acquire high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-assisted system substantially outperforms conventional benchmark schemes in spectrum-sharing CR systems, validating RA's capability to simultaneously enhance the communication quality at the SR and mitigate interference at the PR.</p>

            <p>Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael Cisneros, Leyan Fang, Wei He, Romeo Ortega</p>
            <p>In this paper we propose a variation of the widely popular Interconnection-and-Damping-Assigment Passivity-Based Control (IDA-PBC) based on Poincare's Lemma to design output feedback globally stabilizing controllers for two dimensional systems. The procedure is constructive and, in comparison with the classical IDA-PBC, whose application is often stymied by the need to solve the (infamous) matching partial differential equation (PDE), in this new method the PDE is replaced by an ordinary differential equation, whose solution is far simpler. The procedure is then applied for the design of voltage-feedback controllers for the three most typical DC-to-DC power converter topologies: the Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost. It is assumed that these converters feed an uncertain load, which is characterized by a static relation between its voltage and current. In the case when the load consists of the parallel connection of a resistive term and a constant power load we propose an adaptive version of the design, adding an identification scheme for the load parameters. This allows the controller to regulate the converter output when the load varies-that is a typical scenario in these applications. Extensive numerical simulations and experimental results validate the approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burak Dindar, Can Berk Saner, Hüseyin Kemal Çakmak, Veit Hagenmeyer</p>
            <p>As the role of distribution system (DS) flexibility in transmission system operator (TSO) network management becomes increasingly vital, data privacy concerns hinder seamless interoperability. The notion of the feasible operating region (FOR), defined in the PQ domain, has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving approach. However, effectively leveraging FOR in TSO operations remains challenging due to three key factors: its accurate determination in large-scale, meshed DS networks; its tractable analytical representation; and its economic valuation. In the present paper, we propose a novel AC optimal power flow (OPF)-based method to construct a three-dimensional PQV-FOR, explicitly accounting for voltage variability and diverse flexibility-providing unit (FPU) characteristics. The construction process employs a two-stage sampling strategy that combines bounding box projection and Fibonacci direction techniques to efficiently capture the FOR. We then introduce an implicit polynomial fitting approach to analytically represent the FOR. Furthermore, we derive a quadratic cost function over the PQV domain to monetize the FOR. Thus, the proposed framework enables single-round TSO-DSO coordination: the DSO provides an analytical FOR and cost model; the TSO determines operating point at the point of common coupling (PCC) within the FOR-based AC-OPF; and the DSO computes FPU dispatch by solving its local OPF, without computationally intensive disaggregation or iterative coordination. Case studies on meshed DS with up to 533 buses, integrated into TS, demonstrates the method's efficiency compared to standard AC-OPF. On average, the proposed approach yields negligible cost deviations of at most 0.058% across test cases, while reducing computation times by up to 58.11%.</p>

            <p>Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana. This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\% relative to the existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\%), albeit with modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable HVAC control solution.</p>

            <h2>A Scalable Design Approach to Resilient Architectures for Interconnected Cyber-Physical Systems: Safety Guarantees under Multiple Attacks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eman Badr, Abdullah Al Maruf</p>
            <p>Complex, interconnected cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly prevalent in domains such as power systems. Cyber-resilient architectures have been proposed to recover compromised cyber components of CPS. Recent works have studied tuning the recovery times of such architectures to guarantee safety in single-system settings. Extending these designs to interconnected CPS is more challenging, since solutions must account for attacks on multiple subsystems that can occur in any order and potentially infinite possible temporal overlap. This paper aims to address the aforementioned challenge by developing a scalable framework to assign resilient architectures and to inform the tuning of their recovery times. Our approach introduces a scalar index that quantifies the impact of each subsystem on safety under compromised input. These indices aggregate linearly across subsystems, enabling scalable analysis under arbitrary attack orderings and temporal overlaps. We establish a linear inequality relating each subsystem's index and recovery time that guarantees safety and guides resilient architecture assignment. We also propose a segmentation-based approach to strengthen the previously derived conditions. We then present algorithms to compute the proposed indices and to find a cost-optimal architecture assignment with a safety guarantee. We validate the framework through a case study on temperature regulation in interconnected rooms under different attack scenarios.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Vitthal Thorat, Juhi Singh, Rajdip Nayek</p>
            <p>Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks, including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification. This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However, during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.</p>

            <p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output and utilisation is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm for capacity expansion planning if only uncertain data is available for a year's operative parameters. When faced with multiple possible operating years, the quality of a solution derived on a single operating year's data is evaluated for all years, and the optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of cold dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany for 40 different operating years shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered years increasing the total annual cost by 1.6-2.9% compared to a lower bound. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time-series, combining dark lull and cold period effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhushan Ramalingam, Yaish Riaz, Priyanthi Rajamanoharan, Piyumi Dasanayaka</p>
            <p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual impairment, and effective treatment options depend heavily on timely and accurate diagnosis. Deep learning models have demonstrated great success identifying DR from retinal images. However, relying only on predictions made by models, without any indication of model confidence, creates uncertainty and poses significant risk in clinical settings. This paper investigates an alternative in uncertainty-aware deep learning models, including a rejection mechanism to reject low-confidence predictions, contextualized by deferred decision-making in clinical practice. The results show there is a trade-off between prediction coverage and coverage reliability. The Variational Bayesian model adopted a more conservative strategy when predicting DR, subsequently rejecting the uncertain predictions. The model is evaluated by means of important performance metrics such as Accuracy on accepted predictions, the proportion of accepted cases (coverage), the rejection-ratio, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The findings also demonstrate a clear trade-off between accuracy and caution, establishing that the use of uncertainty estimation and selective rejection improves the model's reliability in safety-critical diagnostic use cases.</p>

            <p>Electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (EAMoD) systems are emerging all over the world. However, their potential swarm charging in depots may deteriorate operation of the power system, further in turn affecting EAMoD system's optimal operation. To prevent this latent risk, we develop a real-time coordination framework for the EAMoD system and the power system. First, the temporal-spatial characteristics of EAMoD fleets are fully described based on a Markov decision process model, including serving trips, repositioning, and charging. Second, charger accessibility of EAMoD depot charging is well modeled as real-world configuration, wherein fast and slow charge piles are both included. Third, the power system regulation model provides real-time charging regulation constraints for EAMoD systems to prevent potential overload and undervoltage. To address the poor solution quality attributed to the complex decision space of the EAMoD system, this paper proposes a piecewise linear-based approximate dynamic programming algorithm combined with model predictive control. Numerical experiments in the Manhattan and a 14-node power distribution network validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and underscore the necessity of system coordination.</p>

These providers need to strategically optimize their charging prices to improve the profits considering operation conditions of the coupled power-transportation network. However, the optimal pricing problem generally involves the user equilibrium model, which leads to a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. As a result, the pricing problem is non-convex and computationally intractable especially for large-scale network. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized sensitivity analysis approach for optimal pricing of electric vehicle charging on coupled power-transportation network. Specifically, we adopt a sensitivity analysis to capture the best response of charging demand to charging price in the gradient form. Consequently, charging service providers can make pricing decisions based on the gradient information instead of the conventional KKT conditions of the user equilibrium model. We then propose a tailored gradient descent algorithm to solve the whole pricing problem. The mathematical proof of validity is given and the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is theoretically polynomial. Numerical experiments on different scales of networks verify the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, indicating its potential in evaluating the impact of the optimal pricing on the operational performance of large-scale coupled power-transportation network.</p>

            <h2>Grid Frequency Stability Support Potential of Data Center: A Quantitative Assessment of Flexibility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengyu Ren, Wei Sun, Yifan Wang, Gareth Harrison</p>
            <p>The rapid expansion of data center infrastructure is reshaping power system dynamics by significantly increasing electricity demand while also offering potential for fast and controllable flexibility. To ensure reliable operation under such conditions, the frequency secured unit commitment problem must be solved with enhanced modeling of demand side frequency response. In this work, we propose a data-driven linearization framework based on decision tree based constraint learning to embed nonlinear nadir frequency constraints into mixed-integer linear programming. This approach enables tractable optimization of generation schedules and fast frequency response from data centers. Through case studies on both a benchmark system and a 2030 future scenario with higher DC penetration, we demonstrate that increasing the proportion of flexible DC load consistently improves system cost efficiency and supports renewable integration. However, this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns, motivating the introduction of the Marginal Flexibility Value metric to quantify the economic value of additional flexibility. The results highlight that as DCs become a larger share of system load, their active participation in frequency response will be increasingly indispensable for maintaining both economic and secure system operations.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Fault Classification and Localization in Power System Protection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Oelhaf, Georg Kordowich, Changhun Kim, Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro, Christian Bergler, Andreas Maier, Johann Jäger, Siming Bayer</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2 of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.</p>

            <h2>Joint Price and Power MPC for Peak Power Reduction at Workplace EV Charging Stations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thibaud Cambronne, Samuel Bobick, Wente Zeng, Scott Moura</p>
            <p>Demand charge often constitutes a significant portion of electricity costs for commercial electric vehicle (EV) charging station operators. This paper explores control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service. Using this framework, we propose a model predictive control approach to reduce both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that our algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art benchmark optimization strategy and can significantly reduce station operator costs.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush Patnaik, Adam B Zufall, Stephen K Robinson, Xinfan Lin</p>
            <p>Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40°C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.</p>

            <p>Diffractive optical element based background oriented schlieren (BOS) is a popular technique for quantitative flow visualization. This technique relies on encoding spatial density variations of the test medium in the form of an optical fringe pattern; and hence, its accuracy is directly influenced by the quality of fringe pattern demodulation. We introduce a robust deep learning assisted subspace method which enables reliable fringe pattern demodulation even in the presence of severe noise and uneven fringe distortions in recorded BOS fringe patterns. The method's effectiveness to handle fringe pattern artifacts is demonstrated via rigorous numerical simulations. Furthermore, the method's practical applicability is experimentally validated using real-world BOS images obtained from a liquid diffusion process.</p>

            <h2>A Graph-based Hybrid Beamforming Framework for MIMO Cell-Free ISAC Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanan Du, Sai Xu, Jagmohan Chauhan</p>
            <p>This paper develops a graph-based hybrid beamforming framework for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. Specifically, we construct a novel MIMO cell-free ISAC network model. In this model, multiple dual-function base station (BS) transmitters employ distributed hybrid beamforming to enable simultaneous communication and sensing, while maintaining physical separation between the transmitters and the radar receiver. Building on this model, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem under a power constraint to jointly improve communication and sensing performance. To solve it, the problem is first reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem. Then, a graph-based method composed of multiple graph neural networks (GNNs) is developed to realize hybrid beamforming with either perfect or imperfect channel state information. Once trained, the neural network model can be deployed distributively across BSs, enabling fast and efficient inference. To further reduce inference latency, a custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerator is developed. Numerical simulations validate the communication and sensing capabilities of the proposed optimization approach, while experimental evaluations demonstrate remarkable performance gains of FPGA-based acceleration in GNN inference.</p>

            <p>Urban traffic anomalies such as collisions and disruptions threaten the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation systems. We present a simulation-based framework for modeling, detecting, and predicting such anomalies in urban networks. Using the SUMO platform, we generate reproducible rear-end and intersection crash scenarios with matched baselines, enabling controlled experimentation and comparative evaluation. We record vehicle-level travel time, speed, and emissions for edge and network-level analysis. On this dataset, we develop a hybrid forecasting architecture that combines bidirectional long short-term memory networks with a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network to capture temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies. Our simulation studies on the Broadway corridor in New York City demonstrate the framework's ability to reproduce consistent incident conditions, quantify their effects, and provide accurate multi-horizon traffic forecasts. Our results highlight the value of combining controlled anomaly generation with deep predictive models to support reproducible evaluation and sustainable traffic management.</p>

            <p>The proliferation of cell-free Massive MIMO represents a transformative shift in wireless network architecture, addressing critical limitations of conventional distributed Massive MIMO systems.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Luo, Shuaifeng Jiang, Saeed R. Khosravirad, Ahmed Alkhateeb</p>
            <p>Deep learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated strong performance in compressing and reconstructing channel state information (CSI) while reducing feedback overhead in massive MIMO systems. A key challenge, however, is their reliance on extensive site-specific training data, whose real-world collection incurs significant overhead and limits scalability across deployment sites. To address this, we propose leveraging site-specific digital twins to assist the training of DL-based CSI compression models. The digital twin integrates an electromagnetic (EM) 3D model of the environment, a hardware model, and ray tracing to produce site-specific synthetic CSI data, allowing DL models to be trained without the need for extensive real-world measurements. We further develop a fidelity analysis framework that decomposes digital twin quality into four key aspects: 3D geometry, material properties, ray tracing, and hardware modeling. We explore how these factors influence the reliability of the data and model performance. To enhance the adaptability to real-world environments, we propose a refinement strategy that incorporates a limited amount of real-world data to fine-tune the DL model pre-trained on the digital twin dataset. Evaluation results show that models trained on site-specific digital twins outperform those trained on generic datasets, with the proposed refinement method effectively enhancing performance using limited real-world data. The simulations also highlight the importance of digital twin fidelity, especially in 3D geometry, ray tracing, and hardware modeling, for improving CSI reconstruction quality. This analysis framework offers valuable insights into the critical fidelity aspects, and facilitates more efficient digital twin development and deployment strategies for various wireless communication tasks.</p>

            <p>Satellite systems are expected to be a cornerstone of sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing ubiquitous coverage and supporting a wide range of services across communications, sensing, and positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT). Meeting these demands with current function-specific payload architectures is challenging in terms of cost, spectral use, and sustainability. This survey introduces the framework of multi-functional satellite systems (MFSS), which integrate two or more of these core services into a single payload, enabling resource sharing and functional synergy. A unified taxonomy is proposed, covering joint communications and sensing (JCAS), joint communications and PNT (JCAP), joint sensing and PNT (JSAP), and fully integrated joint communications, sensing, and PNT (JCSAP) systems. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in each domain, examines existing payload architectures, and outlines cooperative, integrated, and joint design strategies. Key challenges, including waveform co-design, synchronization, interference mitigation, and resource management, are discussed, along with potential solutions and future research directions. By unifying diverse satellite capabilities within a single platform, MFSS can achieve higher spectral efficiency, reduced launch mass and cost, improved energy use, and enhanced service versatility, contributing to the development of sustainable and intelligent non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) for the 6G and beyond space era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishant Kumar, Shravan Kumar Singh, Nikhil Chander</p>
            <p>Deploying vertical bifacial PV modules can play a significant role in agrivoltaics, fencing walls, noise barriers, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar PV for electric vehicles, and many other applications. This research work presents the performance comparison of vertical bifacial photovoltaic (VBPV) modules facing East-West (E-W) and South-North (S-N) directions. Also, the VBPV modules are compared with vertical and tilted south-facing monofacial PV modules. Six PV modules (monofacial and bifacial) were installed at the rooftop of IIT Bhilai academic building, Raipur (21.16° N, 81.65° E), India, and studied for a year from May 2022 to April 2023. The results show that the E-W facing VBPV module gives two production peaks, one in the morning and another in the evening, as compared to the single notable rise at midday observed for a monofacial module. From a series of experiments, 19 days of data were collected over the one-year period from May 2022 to April 2023, with specific inclusion of important days like solstices and equinoxes. In addition, the energy generation results are compared with PVsyst simulations, while also addressing the limitations of the PVsyst simulation of vertical PV modules. E-W bifacial generation is higher than S-N bifacial and south-facing monofacial modules from February to April. The VBPV modules in E-W and S-N orientations present a promising opportunity for expanding the agrivoltaics sector in tropical and sub-tropical countries, like India. This has huge implications for addressing the sustainable development goals by simultaneously contributing to sustainable land management, green energy generation, energy security and water conservation in the vast geo-climatic expanse of tropics.</p>

            <p>The growing complexity of global supply chains has made hardware Trojans a significant threat in sensor-based power electronics. Traditional Trojan designs depend on digital triggers or fixed threshold conditions that can be detected during standard testing. In contrast, we introduce Environmental Rate Manipulation (ERM), a novel Trojan triggering mechanism that activates by monitoring the rate of change in environmental parameters rather than their absolute values. This approach allows the Trojan to remain inactive under normal conditions and evade redundancy and sensor-fusion defenses. We implement a compact 14~$\mu$m$^2$ circuit that measures capacitor charging rates in standard sensor front-ends and disrupts inverter pulse-width modulation PWM signals when a rapid change is induced. Experiments on a commercial Texas Instruments solar inverter demonstrate that ERM can trigger catastrophic driver chip failure. Furthermore, ETAP simulations indicate that a single compromised 100~kW inverter may initiate cascading grid instabilities. The attack's significance extends beyond individual sensors to entire classes of environmental sensing systems common in power electronics, demonstrating fundamental challenges for hardware security.</p>

            <h2>Optimal transmission expansion modestly reduces decarbonization costs of U.S. electricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rangrang Zheng, Greg Schivley, Matthias Fripp, Michael J. Roberts</p>
            <p>Expanding interregional transmission is widely viewed as essential for integrating clean energy into decarbonized power systems. Using the open-source Switch capacity expansion model with detailed representation of existing U.S. generation and transmission infrastructure, solar, wind, and storage resources, and hourly operations, we evaluate the role of transmission across least-cost, socially optimal, and zero-emissions scenarios for 2050. An optimal nationwide plan would more than triple interregional transmission capacity, yet this reduces the cost of a zero-emissions system by only 7% relative to relying on existing transmission, as storage, solar and wind siting, and nuclear generation serve as close substitutes. Regional cost and rent effects vary, with transmission generally favoring wind and hydrogen resources over solar and batteries. Sensitivity analysis shows diminishing returns: one-fifth of the benefits of full expansion can be achieved with one-twelfth of the added capacity, while cost reductions for batteries and hydrogen provide comparable or greater system savings than transmission. Reconductoring -- quadrupling line capacity at half the cost of new builds achieves nearly all the benefits of unconstrained expansion. These results suggest that while substantial transmission expansion is economically justified, a diverse set of flexibility resources can substitute for large-scale grid build-out, and the relative value of transmission is highly contingent on technological and cost developments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuting Hu, Jinjun Xiong</p>
            <p>A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.</p>

            <h2>Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Hu, Zheyuan Cheng</p>
            <p>Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.</p>

            <p>Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.</p>

            <p>The capacity market provides economic guidance for generation investment and ensures the adequacy of generation capability for power systems. With the rapidly increasing proportion of renewable energy, the adequacy of flexibility and resilience becomes more crucial for the secure operation of power systems. In this context, this paper incorporates the flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market by formulating the capacity demand curves for ramping capability, inertia and recovery capabilities besides the generation capability. The guidance on generation investment of the capacity market is also taken into account by solving the generation investment equilibrium among generation companies with a Nash Cournot model employing an equivalent quadratic programming formulation. The overall problem is established as a trilevel game and an iterative algorithm is devised to formulate the capacity demand curves in the upper level based on Genco's investment acquired from the middle and lower levels. The case study further demonstrates that to incorporate flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market could stimulate proper generation investment and ensure the adequacy of flexibility and resilience in power systems.</p>

            <p>For electrifying the transportation sector, deploying a strategically planned and efficient charging infrastructure is essential. This paper presents a two-phase approach for electric vehicle (EV) charger deployment that integrates spatial point-of-interest analysis and maximum coverage optimization over an integrated spatial power grid. Spatial-focused studies in the literature often overlook electrical grid constraints, while grid-focused work frequently considers statistically modeled EV charging demand. To address these gaps, a new framework is proposed that combines spatial network planning with electrical grid considerations. This study approaches EV charger planning from a perspective of the distribution grid, starting with an estimation of EV charging demand and the identification of optimal candidate locations. It ensures that the capacity limits of newly established chargers are maintained within the limits of the power grid. This framework is applied in a test case for the Dallas area, integrating the existing EV charger network with an 8500-bus distribution system for comprehensive planning.</p>

            <p>Rising global energy demand from population growth raises concerns about the sustainability of fossil fuels. Consequently, the energy sector has increasingly transitioned to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are naturally abundant. However, the periodic and unpredictable nature of these resources pose significant challenges for power system reliability. Accurate forecasting is essential to ensure grid stability and optimize energy management. But due to the high variability in weather conditions which directly affected wind and solar energy, achieving precise predictions remains difficult. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), offer promising solutions to improve forecasting accuracy. The study highlights three widely used algorithms for solar and wind energy prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models are capable of learning complex patterns from historical and environmental data, enabling more accurate forecasts and contributing to the enhanced efficiency and reliability of renewable energy systems. This review aims to provide an overview on RF, XGBoost, and LSTM by conducting a comparative analysis across three essential criteria: research prevalence, model complexity, and computational execution time.</p>

            <p>Coordinated planning of generation, storage, and transmission more accurately captures the interactions among these three capacity types necessary to meet electricity demand, at least in theory. However, in practice, U.S. system operators typically follow a sequential planning approach: They first determine future generation and storage additions based on an assumed unconstrained (`copper plate') system. Next, they perform dispatch simulations of this projected generation and storage capacity mix on the existing transmission grid to identify transmission constraint violations. These violations indicate the need for transmission upgrades. We describe a multistage, multi-locational planning model that co-optimizes generation, storage, and transmission investments. The model respects reliability constraints as well as state energy and climate policies. We test the two planning approaches using a current stakeholder-informed 20-zone model of the PJM region, developed for the current FERC Order No. 1920 compliance filing process. In our most conservative model specification, we find that the co-optimized approach estimates 67% lower transmission upgrade needs than the sequential model, leading to total system costs that are .6% lower and similar reliability and climate outcomes. Our sensitivities show larger transmission and cost savings and reliability and climate benefits from co-optimized planning.</p>

            <p>The increasing decentralization of power systems driven by a large number of renewable energy sources poses challenges in power flow optimization. Partially unknown power line properties can render model-based approaches unsuitable. With increasing deployment of sensors, data-driven methods rise as a promising alternative. They offer the flexibility to adapt to varying grid structures and unknown line properties. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven representation of nonlinear power flow equations for radial grids based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma. The approach allows for direct integration of input/output data into power flow optimisation, enabling cost minimization and constraint enforcement without requiring explicit knowledge of the electrical properties or the topology of the grid. Moreover, we formulate a convex relaxation to ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art solvers. In a numerical case study, we demonstrate that the novel approach performs similar to state-of-the-art methods, without the need for an explicit system identification step.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Speech Watermarking for Speech Synthesis via Progressive Knowledge Distillation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Cui, Peter Pan, Lei He, Sheng Zhao</p>
            <p>With the rapid advancement of speech generative models, unauthorized voice cloning poses significant privacy and security risks. Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.</p>

            <h2>Unlicensed Band Allocation for Heterogeneous Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Heng Chou</p>
            <p>Based on the License-Assisted Access (LAA) small cell architecture, the LAA coexisting with Wi-Fi heterogeneous networks provides LTE mobile users with high bandwidth efficiency as the unlicensed channels are shared among LAA and Wi-Fi. However, LAA and Wi-Fi interfere with each other when both systems use the same unlicensed channel in heterogeneous networks. In such a network, unlicensed band allocation for LAA and Wi-Fi is an important issue that may affect the quality of service (QoS) of both systems significantly. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and conduct simulation experiments to study four allocations for the unlicensed band: unlicensed full allocation (UFA), unlicensed time-division allocation (UTA), and UFA/UTA with buffering mechanism (UFAB and UTAB) for the LAA data packets. We evaluate the performance of these unlicensed band allocation schemes in terms of the acceptance rate of both LAA and Wi-Fi packet data in the LAA buffer queue. Our study provides guidelines for designing the channel occupation phase and the buffer size of the LAA small cell.</p>

            <p>An experimental study on magnetic near-field (NF) scanning of printed circuit board (PCB) emission radiation is developed in this paper. The design and installation of the electromagnetic (EM) NF scanner is introduced. The test bed of magnetic NF emission in the microwave frequency range is described. The methodology of the microstrip magnetic NF probe is discussed. The probe calibration process was performed following the IEC 61967-1 NF scanning standard. The NF scanner functioning is tested with passive microstrip circuit square loop probe and device under test (DUT) PCB radiation in the test plan positioned at 1-mm above the ground plane. Based on the standard test with I-shape 50-$\Omega$ transmission line (TL), the calibration process of radiated magnetic field was validated by comparison between HFSS__ simulation and experimentation in very wideband frequency from 0.1-GHz to 3-GHz. Then, a nonstandard TL based DUT was experimented. Accordingly, the cartographies of scanned magnetic NF at two different test frequencies, 2 GHz and 3 GHz, are discussed. The NF scanner is under development for targeting the EMC radiated emission of PCB dedicated to operate in 6G wireless communication.</p>

            <h2>Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Yin, Li Qiao, Yu Ma, Shuo Sun, Kan Li, Zhen Gao, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR > 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishant Mehrotra, Sandesh Rao Mattu, Saif Khan Mohammed, Ronny Hadani, Robert Calderbank</p>
            <p>Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.</p>

            <h2>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhe Zhang, Qiang Chen, Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Baheri, David Millard, Alireza Vahid</p>
            <p>Distributed systems require fusing heterogeneous local probability distributions into a global summary over sparse and unreliable communication networks. Traditional consensus algorithms, which average distributions in Euclidean space, ignore their inherent geometric structure, leading to misleading results. Wasserstein barycenters offer a geometry-aware alternative by minimizing optimal transport costs, but their entropic approximations via the Sinkhorn algorithm typically require centralized coordination. This paper proposes a fully decentralized Sinkhorn algorithm that reformulates the centralized geometric mean as an arithmetic average in the log-domain, enabling approximation through local gossip protocols. Agents exchange log-messages with neighbors, interleaving consensus phases with local updates to mimic centralized iterations without a coordinator. To optimize bandwidth, we integrate event-triggered transmissions and b-bit quantization, providing tunable trade-offs between accuracy and communication while accommodating asynchrony and packet loss. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence to a neighborhood of the centralized entropic barycenter, with bias linearly dependent on consensus tolerance, trigger threshold, and quantization error. Complexity scales near-linearly with network size. Simulations confirm near-centralized accuracy with significantly fewer messages, across various topologies and conditions.</p>

The dataset comprises 6 paralinguistic categories with 118.75 hours of data and precise timestamps, all derived from natural conversational speech. Our contributions lie in introducing the first automated method for constructing large-scale paralinguistic datasets and releasing the SynParaSpeech corpus, which advances speech generation through more natural paralinguistic synthesis and enhances speech understanding by improving paralinguistic event detection.

            <h2>Generalized Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architectures: Theory and Design via Structure-oriented Symmetric Unitary Projection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohua Zhou, Tianyu Fang, Yijie Mao, Bruno Clerckx</p>
            <p>Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead), and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high efficiency.</p>

Our final ensemble combines nnU-Net ($\gamma=0.7$), fine-tuned Swin UNETR, and HFF-Net, achieving Dice scores of 72.3% (ET), 95.6% (NET), 68.9% (CC), 89.5% (ED), 92.3% (TC), and 92.3% (WT), respectively.</p>

            <p>This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.</p>

            <p>Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.</p>

            <p>This paper presents and discusses a mathematical model inspired by control theory to derive optimal public policies for minimizing costs associated with the reduction and control of criminal activity in a population. Specifically, we analyze the optimal control problem \begin{equation*} \min G(u_1, u_2, u_3) = \int_{0}^{t_{\text{F}}} \left( I(t) - R(t) + \frac{B_1}{2} u_1^2(t) + \frac{B_2}{2} u_2^2(t) + \frac{B_3}{2} u_3^2(t) \right) \, dt. \end{equation*} where $I=I(t)$ and $R=R(t)$ satisfies the system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned} \dot{S} &= \Lambda - (1-u_1)SI - \mu S + ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + \rho \Omega R,\\ \dot{I} &= (1-u_1)SI - (\mu + \delta_1)I - ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - ((1+u_3)\gamma_2)I + (1-\Omega)\rho R,\\ \dot{R} &= ((1+u_2)\gamma_1)I - (\mu + \delta_2 + \rho)R. \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} Our approach assumes that the social and economic effects of criminal behavior can be modeled by a dynamic SIR-type system, which serves as a constraint on a cost functional associated with the strategies implemented by government and law enforcement authorities to reduce criminal behavior. Using optimal control theory, the proposed controls, i.e., preventive policies (such as community and social cohesion programs), are expected to have a significant and positive impact on crime reduction, generating opportunities for the most disadvantaged sectors of Cali society and contributing to long-term security. Given that resources to address this problem are limited, this research aims to determine an optimal combination of public interventions and policies that minimize criminality at the lowest possible economic cost, using an SIR model, tools from variational calculus, and optimal control theory.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we employ the thoughts and methodologies of Shannon's information theory to solve the problem of the optimal radar parameter estimation. Based on a general radar system model, the \textit{a posteriori} probability density function of targets' parameters is derived. Range information (RI) and entropy error (EE) are defined to evaluate the performance. It is proved that acquiring 1 bit of the range information is equivalent to reducing estimation deviation by half. The closed-form approximation for the EE is deduced in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, which demonstrates that the EE degenerates to the mean square error (MSE) when the SNR is tending to infinity. Parameter estimation theorem is then proved, which claims that the theoretical RI is achievable. The converse claims that there exists no unbiased estimator whose empirical RI is larger than the theoretical RI. Simulation result demonstrates that the theoretical EE is tighter than the commonly used Cramér-Rao bound and the ZivZakai bound.</p>

            <p>Many natural and man-made network systems need to maintain certain patterns, such as working at equilibria or limit cycles, to function properly. Thus, the ability to stabilize such patterns is crucial. Most of the existing studies on stabilization assume that network systems states can be measured online so that feedback control strategies can be used. However, in many real-world scenarios, systems states, e.g., neuronal activity in the brain, are often difficult to measure. In this paper, we take this situation into account and study the stabilization problem of linear network systems with an open-loop control strategy (vibrational control). We derive a graph-theoretic sufficient condition for structural vibrational stabilizability, under which network systems can always be stabilized. We further provide an approach to select the locations in the network for control placement and design corresponding vibrational inputs to stabilize systems that satisfy this condition. Finally, we provide some numerical results that demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kushagra Gupta, Xinjie Liu, Ross Allen, Ufuk Topcu, David Fridovich-Keil</p>
            <p>Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with an asymptotic local \textit{linear} convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local \textit{superlinear} convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods with similar guarantees do not offer convergence rates in the nonconvex-nonconcave setting. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.

            <p>This work introduces the M6(GPT)3 composer system, capable of generating complete, multi-minute musical compositions with complex structures in any time signature, in the MIDI domain from input descriptions in natural language. The system utilizes an autoregressive transformer language model to map natural language prompts to composition parameters in JSON format. The defined structure includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody, bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. We propose a genetic algorithm for the generation of melodic elements. The algorithm incorporates mutations with musical significance and a fitness function based on normal distribution and predefined musical feature values. The values adaptively evolve, influenced by emotional parameters and distinct playing styles. The system for generating percussion in any time signature utilises probabilistic methods, including Markov chains. Through both human and objective evaluations, we demonstrate that our music generation approach outperforms baselines on specific, musically meaningful metrics, offering a viable alternative to purely neural network-based systems.</p>

However, effectively mapping the complex, multidimensional attributes of speech into discrete tokens remains challenging. This process demands acoustic, semantic, and contextual information for precise speech representations. Existing speech representations generally fall into two categories: acoustic tokens from audio codecs and semantic tokens from speech self-supervised learning models. Although recent efforts have unified acoustic and semantic tokens for improved performance, they overlook the crucial role of contextual representation in comprehensive speech modeling. Our empirical investigations reveal that the absence of contextual representations results in elevated Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) scores in speech transcriptions. To address these limitations, we propose two novel distillation approaches: (1) a language model (LM)-guided distillation method that incorporates contextual information, and (2) a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided distillation technique that effectively distills multimodal representations (acoustic, semantic, and contextual) into a comprehensive speech tokenizer, termed DM-Codec. The DM-Codec architecture adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a Residual Vector Quantizer (RVQ) and incorporates the LM and SM during the training process. Experiments show DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art speech tokenization models, reducing WER by up to 13.46%, WIL by 9.82%, and improving speech quality by 5.84% and intelligibility by 1.85% on the LibriSpeech benchmark dataset.

            <h2>Is FISHER All You Need in The Multi-AUV Underwater Target Tracking Task?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanwen Xie, Jingzehua Xu, Ziqi Zhang, Xiangwang Hou, Dongfang Ma, Shuai Zhang, Yong Ren, Dusit Niyato</p>
            <p>It is significant to employ multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions. The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.</p>

            <h2>Training-Free Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahdi Saberi, Chi Zhang, Mehmet Akçakaya</p>
            <p>Deep learning (DL) methods have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency, we devise a novel mitigation objective that is minimized in a small ball around the attack input. Results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. We also introduce a practically relevant scenario for small adversarial perturbations that models impulse noise in raw data, which relates to \emph{herringbone artifacts}, and show the applicability of our approach in this setting. Finally, we show our mitigation approach remains effective in two \emph{realistic} extension scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy.</p>

            <h2>Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Chandak</p>
            <p>Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</p>

            <h2>LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihe Wang, Nan Huang, Nadia Mammone, Marco Cecchi, Xiang Zhang</p>
            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Donker van Heel, Rutger-Jan Lange, Bram van Os, Dick van Dijk</p>
            <p>Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinran Liu, Xu Dong, Shenbin Qian, Diptesh Kanojia, Wenwu Wang, Zhenhua Feng</p>
            <p>Music-driven dance generation is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography while ensuring physically realistic and precisely synchronized dance sequences with the music's beats and rhythm. Although significant progress has been made in music-conditioned dance generation, most existing methods struggle to convey specific stylistic attributes in generated dance. To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based framework for genre-specific 3D full-body dance generation, conditioned on both music and descriptive text. To effectively incorporate genre information, we develop a text-based control mechanism that maps input prompts, either explicit genre labels or free-form descriptive text, into genre-specific control signals, enabling precise and controllable text-guided generation of genre-consistent dance motions. Furthermore, to enhance the alignment between music and textual conditions, we leverage the features of a music foundation model, facilitating coherent and semantically aligned dance synthesis. Last, to balance the objectives of extracting text-genre information and maintaining high-quality generation results, we propose a novel multi-task optimization strategy. This effectively balances competing factors such as physical realism, spatial accuracy, and text classification, significantly improving the overall quality of the generated sequences. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance and AIST++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of GCDance over the existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p>

            <h2>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harish K. Dureppagari, R. Michael Buehrer, Harpreet S. Dhillon</p>
            <p>In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</p>

            <h2>Rapidly Converging Time-Discounted Ergodicity on Graphs for Active Inspection of Confined Spaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Wong, Ryan H. Lee, Tyler M. Paine, Santosh Devasia, Ashis G. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Ergodic exploration has spawned a lot of interest in mobile robotics due to its ability to design time trajectories that match desired spatial coverage statistics. However, current ergodic approaches are for continuous spaces, which require detailed sensory information at each point and can lead to fractal-like trajectories that cannot be tracked easily. This paper presents a new ergodic approach for graph-based discretization of continuous spaces. It also introduces a new time-discounted ergodicity metric, wherein early visitations of information-rich nodes are weighted more than late visitations. A Markov chain synthesized using a convex program is shown to converge more rapidly to time-discounted ergodicity than the traditional fastest mixing Markov chain. The resultant ergodic traversal method is used within a hierarchical framework for active inspection of confined spaces with the goal of detecting anomalies robustly using SLAM-driven Bayesian hypothesis testing. Experiments on a ground robot show the advantages of this framework over three continuous space ergodic planners as well as greedy and random exploration methods for left-behind foreign object debris detection in a ballast tank.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddharth Chandak, Shaan Ul Haque, Nicholas Bambos</p>
            <p>Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm with applications in reinforcement learning and optimization. Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.</p>

            <p>Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that our framework can successfully address additional scenarios previously intractable for existing methods - neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators for the purpose of trajectory prediction.</p>

            <p>Audio generation systems now create very realistic soundscapes that can enhance media production, but also pose potential risks. Several studies have examined deepfakes in speech or singing voice. However, environmental sounds have different characteristics, which may make methods for detecting speech and singing deepfakes less effective for real-world sounds. In addition, existing datasets for environmental sound deepfake detection are limited in scale and audio types. To address this gap, we introduce EnvSDD, the first large-scale curated dataset designed for this task, consisting of 45.25 hours of real and 316.74 hours of fake audio. The test set includes diverse conditions to evaluate the generalizability, such as unseen generation models and unseen datasets. We also propose an audio deepfake detection system, based on a pre-trained audio foundation model. Results on EnvSDD show that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems from speech and singing domains.</p>

            <p>Although audio foundations models have seen great progress on a wide variety of tasks, their application in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise has been less successful. Moreover, as audio foundation models are typically trained on dry, single-channel audio clips, the inherent spatial nature of real-world sound scenes is overlooked and tasks involving sound localization ruled out. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a General-purpose Real-world Audio Model utilizing a multi-channel masked auto-encoder approach to efficiently learn spatial audio representations from high-quality simulated real-world scenes. To evaluate the performance of GRAM and other audio foundation models in real-world sound scenes, we release Nat-HEAR: A naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark suite comprising a simulated real-world version, as well as two new sound localization tasks. We show that the performance of GRAM surpasses all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models and speech models on both HEAR and Nat-HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also showcases state-of-the-art localization performance, surpassing even supervised sound localization approaches, and can be flexibly applied either to a two-channel, binaural sound format or a four-channel, Ambisonics format. Validating GRAM's performance on real-world sound recordings demonstrates robust transfer to real-world scenes. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advancement towards robust, spatial audio foundation models for real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have achieved strong results in semantic tasks like speech recognition and translation, but remain limited in modeling paralinguistic cues such as emotion. Existing approaches often treat emotion understanding as a classification problem, offering little insight into the underlying rationale behind predictions. In this work, we explore emotion reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned, evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and evidential grounding of the generated responses. Experiments on two out-of-domain datasets demonstrate the generalization capabilities of the resulting model.</p>

            <p>Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks. They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

            <p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms, represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve competitive performance on large-scale speech processing tasks. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS) mechanism, which simulates multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further integrates a Re-parameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$ respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy efficiency.

            <p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining Bézier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p>

By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks.

            <p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bahar Taşkesen, Dan A. Iancu, Çağıl Koçyiğit, Daniel Kuhn</p>
            <p>We study a generalization of the classical discrete-time, Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control problem where the noise distributions affecting the states and observations are unknown and chosen adversarially from divergence-based ambiguity sets centered around a known nominal distribution. For a finite horizon model with Gaussian nominal noise and a structural assumption on the divergence that is satisfied by many examples -- including 2-Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, moment-based divergences, entropy-regularized optimal transport, or Fisher (score-matching) divergence -- we prove that a control policy that is affine in the observations is optimal and the adversary's corresponding worst-case optimal distribution is Gaussian. When the nominal means are zero (as in the classical LQG model), we show that the adversary should optimally set the distribution's mean to zero and the optimal control policy becomes linear. Moreover, the adversary should optimally ``inflate" the noise by choosing covariance matrices that dominate the nominal covariance in Loewner order. Exploiting these structural properties, we develop a Frank-Wolfe algorithm whose inner step solves standard LQG subproblems via Kalman filtering and dynamic programming and show that the implementation consistently outperforms semidefinite-programming reformulations of the problem. All structural and algorithmic results extend to an infinite-horizon, average-cost formulation, yielding stationary linear policies and a time-invariant Gaussian distribution for the adversary. Lastly, we show that when the divergence is 2-Wasserstein, the entire framework remains valid when the nominal distributions are elliptical rather than Gaussian.</p>

            <p>Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in audio, vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling with arbitrary sampling rates-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model.

            <h2>BrainPath: Generating Subject-Specific Brain Aging Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yifan Li, Javad Sohankar, Ji Luo, Jing Li, Yi Su</p>
            <p>Quantifying and forecasting individual brain aging trajectories is critical for understanding neurodegenerative disease and the heterogeneity of aging, yet current approaches remain limited. Most models predict chronological age, an imperfect surrogate for biological aging, or generate synthetic MRIs that enhance data diversity but fail to capture subject-specific trajectories. Here, we present BrainPath, a 3D generative framework that learns longitudinal brain aging dynamics during training and, at inference, predicts anatomically faithful MRIs at arbitrary timepoints from a single baseline scan. BrainPath integrates an age calibration loss, a swap learning strategy, and an age perceptual loss to preserve subtle, biologically meaningful variations. Across held-out ADNI and an independent NACC dataset, BrainPath outperforms state-of-the-art reference models in structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and MRI age-difference accuracy, while capturing realistic and temporally consistent aging patterns. Beyond methodological innovation, BrainPath enables personalized mapping of brain aging, synthetic follow-up scan prediction, and trajectory-based analyses, providing a foundation for precision modeling of brain aging and supporting research into neurodegeneration and aging interventions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanxiang Yang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Guangshun Wei, Siyu Ren, Yuan Liu, Junhui Hou, Wenping Wang</p>
            <p>Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we propose a novel network architecture that enables LoD signal representation. Our approach builds on a modified Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and thus lacks native LoD support. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP), which extends the MLP by attaching an output branch, also called tail, to each hidden layer. Each tail refines the residual between the current prediction and the ground-truth signal, so that the accumulated outputs across layers correspond to the target signals at different LoDs, enabling multi-scale modeling with supervision from only a single-resolution signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T-MLP outperforms existing neural LoD baselines across diverse signal representation tasks.</p>

By fine-tuning these models and analyzing their layer-wise representations using SVCCA, k-means clustering, and t-SNE visualizations, we found that Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R capture speaker-specific features effectively in their early layers, with fine-tuning improving stability and performance.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjie Li, Kong Aik Lee, Duc-Tuan Truong, Tianchi Liu, Man-Wai Mak</p>
            <p>There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiqi Xu, Lihao Zhang, Yuyang Du, Qun Yang, Soung Chang Liew</p>
            <p>Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines, otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control this http URL this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot this http URL protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS) trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.</p>

            <h2>Feature Space Analysis by Guided Diffusion Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimiaki Shirahama, Miki Yanobu, Kaduki Yamashita, Miho Ohsaki</p>
            <p>One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains, this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various image attributes are encoded into the user-specified feature. Our decoder is implemented as a guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature. One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into these DNNs' feature spaces.</p>

            <p>We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music.

            <p>We propose MAE-SAM2, a novel foundation model for retinal vascular leakage segmentation on fluorescein angiography images. Due to the small size and dense distribution of the leakage areas, along with the limited availability of labeled clinical data, this presents a significant challenge for segmentation tasks. Our approach integrates a Self-Supervised learning (SSL) strategy, Masked Autoencoder (MAE), with SAM2. In our implementation, we explore different loss functions and conclude a task-specific combined loss. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that MAE-SAM2 outperforms several state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Dice score and Intersection-over-Union (IoU). Compared to the original SAM2, our model achieves a $5\%$ performance improvement, highlighting the promise of foundation models with self-supervised pretraining in clinical imaging tasks.</p>

            <p>Photovoltaic (PV) panels are becoming increasingly widespread in the domain of renewable energy, and thus, small efficiency gains can have massive effects. Anti-reflective and self-cleaning coatings enhance panel performance but degrade over time, requiring periodic reapplication. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a flexible and autonomous way to apply protective coatings more often and at lower cost compared to traditional manual coating methods. In this letter, we propose a quadcopter-based system, equipped with a liquid dispersion mechanism, designed to automate such tasks. The localization stack only uses onboard sensors, relying on visual-inertial odometry and the relative position of the PV panel detected with respect to the quadcopter. The control relies on a model-based controller that accounts for the ground effect and the mass decrease of the quadcopter during liquid dispersion. We validate the autonomy capabilities of our system through extensive indoor and outdoor experiments.</p>

            <p>Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at this https URL.</p>

            <p>We propose MindVL, a multimodal large language model (MLLMs) trained on Ascend NPUs. The training of state-of-the-art MLLMs is often confined to a limited set of hardware platforms and relies heavily on massive, undisclosed data recipes, which hinders reproducibility and open research. To change the common perception that Ascend hardware is unsuitable for efficient full-stage MLLM training, we introduce MindSpeed-MLLM, a highly efficient training framework that supports stable and high-performance training of large-scale Dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on Ascend hardware. Based on this, we provide a systematic and open description of the data production methods and mixing strategies for all training stages. Furthermore, we present MindVL, a data-efficient multimodal large language model trained end-to-end on Ascend NPUs. In addition, we find that averaging weights from checkpoints trained with different sequence lengths is particularly effective and yields further gains when combined with test-time resolution search. Our experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency: MindVL-8B matches the performance of Qwen2.5VL-7B using only 10\% of its training data, while our MoE model, MindVL-671B-A37B, matches Qwen2.5VL-72B using only 3\% of the Qwen2.5VL training data, and achieves comparable performance with other leading multimodal MoE models. Our work provides the community with a valuable hardware alternative, open data recipes, and effective performance-enhancing techniques.</p>

            <p>Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are limited by the scarcity of clean, multilingual recordings. We introduce Sidon, a fast, open-source speech restoration model that converts noisy in-the-wild speech into studio-quality speech and scales to dozens of languages. Sidon consists of two models: w2v-BERT 2.0 finetuned feature predictor to cleanse features from noisy speech and vocoder trained to synthesize restored speech from the cleansed features. Sidon achieves restoration performance comparable to Miipher: Google's internal speech restoration model with the aim of dataset cleansing for speech synthesis. Sidon is also computationally efficient, running up to 500 times faster than real time on a single GPU. We further show that training a TTS model using a Sidon-cleansed automatic speech recognition corpus improves the quality of synthetic speech in a zero-shot setting. Code and model are released to facilitate reproducible dataset cleansing for the research community.</p>

            <p>We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation of Active Power Oscillation in Multi-VSG Grids: An Impedance-Based Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junjie Xiao, Lu Wang, Xiong Du, Pedro Rodriguez, Zian Qin</p>
            <p>Active power oscillations frequently arise in inverter-dominated power systems with multiple converters operating under Virtual Synchronous Generator control, posing risks to system stability and protection coordination. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed, many rely on prior knowledge of system parameters, offer limited damping performance, or involve complex models that lack physical interpretability, making them difficult to apply in practice. To address these challenges, this paper first introduces a physically intuitive RLC equivalent circuit model to explain the root causes of APOs in both stand-alone and grid-connected modes. By mapping inertia, damping, and feeder impedance to capacitive, resistive, and inductive elements, respectively, the model reveals how mismatches among converters lead to inter-unit oscillations characterized by LC resonance. Building on this insight, we propose two mode-specific mitigation strategies: in SA mode, a graph theory based impedance control ensures proportional reactive power sharing and effectively suppresses APOs; and in GC mode, adaptive inertia and damping control with feedforward filtering is designed to reshape transient power dynamics while preserving frequency stability. The proposed methods are validated through extensive simulations and real-time hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating their effectiveness in suppressing oscillations and enhancing the robustness of multi-converter power systems.</p>

            <p>The rise of distributed energy resources (DERs) is reshaping modern distribution grids, introducing new challenges in attaining voltage stability under dynamic and decentralized operating conditions. This paper presents NEO-Grid, a unified learning-based framework for volt-var optimization (VVO) and volt-var control (VVC) that leverages neural network surrogates for power flow and deep equilibrium models (DEQs) for closed-loop control. Our method replaces traditional linear approximations with piecewise-linear ReLU networks trained to capture the nonlinear relationship between power injections and voltage magnitudes. For control, we model the recursive interaction between voltage and inverter response using DEQs, allowing direct fixed-point computation and efficient training via implicit differentiation. We evaluated NEO-Grid on the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating that it significantly improves voltage regulation performance compared to standard linear and heuristic baselines in both optimization and control settings. Our results establish NEO-Grid as a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution for learning-based voltage regulation in distribution grids.</p>

            <p>The provision of renewable electricity is the foundation for a sustainable future. To achieve the goal of sustainable renewable energy, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) could play a key role to counteract the intermittency of solar and wind generation power. In order to aid the system, the BESS can simply charge at low wholesale prices and discharge during high prices, which is also called energy arbitrage. However, the real-time execution of energy arbitrage is not straightforward for many companies due to the fundamentally different behavior of storages compared to conventional power plants. In this work, the optimized operation of standalone BESS in the cross-market energy arbitrage business is addressed by describing a generic framework for trading integrated BESS operation, the development of a suitable backtest engine and a specific optimization-based strategy formulation for cross-market optimized BESS operation. In addition, this strategy is tested in a case study with a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of forecast uncertainty. The results show that the proposed strategy allows an increment in revenues by taking advantage of the increasing market volatility. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis shows the robustness of the proposed strategy, as only a moderate portion of revenues will be lost if real forecasts are adopted.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced due to the mix of single-, two- and three-phase networks as well as due to the high penetration of single-phase devices at the distribution level such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants. However, the network operator must adhere to the voltage unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards for the safety of the equipment as well as the efficiency of the network operation. Existing works have proposed active and reactive power control in the network to minimize imbalances. However, these optimization problems are highly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the inherent non-linearity of unbalanced metrics and power-flow equations. In this work, we propose a linearization approach of unbalance metrics such as voltage unbalance factors (VUF), phase voltage unbalance rate (PVUR), and line voltage unbalance rate (LVUR) using the first order Taylor's approximation. This linearization is then applied to the phase balancing control scheme; it is formulated as a feedback approach where the linearization is updated successively after the active/reactive control setpoint has been actuated and shows improvement in voltage imbalances. We demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme on a standard IEEE benchmark test case, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>In interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and crossing pedestrians, modeling implicit vehicle communication is crucial. In this work, we present a combined prediction and planning approach that allows to consider the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on a pedestrian and predict a pedestrian's reaction. We plan the behavior by solving two consecutive optimal control problems (OCPs) analytically, using variational calculus. We perform a validation step that assesses whether the planned vehicle behavior is adequate to trigger a certain pedestrian reaction, which accounts for the closed-loop characteristics of prediction and planning influencing each other. In this step, we model the influence of the planned vehicle behavior on the pedestrian using a probabilistic behavior acceptance model that returns an estimate for the crossing probability. The probabilistic modeling of the pedestrian reaction facilitates considering the pedestrian's costs, thereby improving cooperative behavior planning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in simulated vehicle-pedestrian interactions with varying initial settings and highlight the decision making capabilities of the planning approach.</p>

However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p>

            <h2>FakeSound2: A Benchmark for Explainable and Generalizable Deepfake Sound Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Xie, Yaoyun Zhang, Xuenan Xu, Yongkang Yin, Chenxing Li, Mengyue Wu, Yuexian Zou</p>
            <p>The rapid development of generative audio raises ethical and security concerns stemming from forged data, making deepfake sound detection an important safeguard against the malicious use of such technologies. Although prior studies have explored this task, existing methods largely focus on binary classification and fall short in explaining how manipulations occur, tracing where the sources originated, or generalizing to unseen sources-thereby limiting the explainability and reliability of detection. To address these limitations, we present FakeSound2, a benchmark designed to advance deepfake sound detection beyond binary accuracy. FakeSound2 evaluates models across three dimensions: localization, traceability, and generalization, covering 6 manipulation types and 12 diverse sources. Experimental results show that although current systems achieve high classification accuracy, they struggle to recognize forged pattern distributions and provide reliable explanations. By highlighting these gaps, FakeSound2 establishes a comprehensive benchmark that reveals key challenges and aims to foster robust, explainable, and generalizable approaches for trustworthy audio authentication.</p>

            <h2>Frequency Domain Stability Conditions for Hybrid AC/DC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dahlia Saba, Dominic Groß</p>
            <p>In this article, we investigate small-signal frequency and DC voltage stability of hybrid AC/DC power systems that combine AC and DC transmission, conventional machine- based generation, and converter-interfaced generation. The main contributions of this work are a compact frequency domain representation of hybrid AC/DC systems and associated stability conditions that can be divided into conditions on the individual bus dynamics and conditions on each DC network. The bus- level conditions apply to a wide range of technologies (e.g., synchronous generators, synchronous condensers, grid-forming renewables and energy storage). Moreover, the system-level conditions establish that hybrid AC/DC systems combining a wide range of devices are stable independently of the network topology provided that the frequency response of converters on each DC network is sufficiently coherent relative to the network coupling strength. Additionally, we develop and validate a novel reduced- order damper winding model for multi-machine systems.</p>
