            <h2>New Algorithm for Structured OFDM Channel Estimation using Subgroup Duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Demerson N. Gonçalves, João T. Dias</p>
            <p>This paper presents a group-theoretic framework for structured channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). By modeling subcarriers as the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_N\), we show that nulling a subgroup \(H \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N\) constrains the channel impulse response to its annihilator \(H^\perp\) in the dual domain. A low-complexity estimator is proposed that detects such structure by evaluating energy concentration across candidate annihilators. Simulations demonstrate consistent gains in mean squared error, bit error rate, and throughput compared with least-squares and linear minimum mean square error baselines, achieving competitive performance with substantially lower complexity and preserved interpretability.</p>

            <h2>Electric Arc Furnaces Scheduling under Electricity Price Volatility with Reinforcement Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruonan Pi, Zhiyuan Fan, Bolun Xu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for optimizing the operation of electric arc furnaces (EAFs) under volatile electricity prices. We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.</p>

            <h2>Analysis of Frequency and Voltage Strength in Power Electronics-Dominated Power Systems Based on Eigen-subsystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huisheng Gao, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Zhiyi Li, Ping Ju</p>
            <p>The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.</p>

            <h2>Power Control of Multi-Layer Repeater Networks (POLARNet)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Siwerson, Johan Thunberg</p>
            <p>In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.</p>

            <h2>InstructMPC: A Human-LLM-in-the-Loop Framework for Context-Aware Power Grid Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixiang Wu, Jiahao Ai, Tinko Sebastian Bartels, Tongxin Li</p>
            <p>The transition toward power grids with high renewable penetration demands context-aware decision making frameworks. Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor (CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T \log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation of Datacenter Demand Ramping and Fluctuation using Hybrid ESS and Supercapacitor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Min-Seung Ko, Jae Woong Shim, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)-based control framework that enables comprehensive power smoothing for hyperscale AI datacenters with large load variations. Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles.</p>

            <h2>Bounding the Minimal Current Harmonic Distortion in Optimal Modulation of Single-Phase Power Converters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Miller, Petros Karamanakos, Tobias Geyer</p>
            <p>Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation technique in which a switching signal is computed offline through an optimization process that accounts for selected performance criteria, such as current harmonic distortion. The optimization determines both the switching angles (i.e., switching times) and the pattern structure (i.e., the sequence of voltage levels). This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs</p>

            <h2>High-performance computing enabled contingency analysis for modern power networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandre Gracia-Calvo, Francesca Rossi, Eduardo Iraola, Juan Carlos Olives-Camps, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo</p>
            <p>Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments.</p>

            <h2>Saturation-based robustly optimal hierarchical operation control of microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ujjwal Pratap, Steffen Hofmann</p>
            <p>This paper studies the problem of robustly optimal operation control of microgrids with a high share of renewable energy sources. The main goal is to ensure optimal operation under a wide range of circumstances, given the highly intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable sources and load demand. We formally state this problem, and, in order to solve it, we make effective use of the hierarchical power system control approach. We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy. We prove that this enables the use of constant power setpoints to achieve optimal operation under certain conditions. In order to relax these conditions, the approach is combined with an energy management system, which solves a robust unit commitment problem within a model predictive control framework. Finally, a case study demonstrates the viability of the control design.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Transmission Switching and Busbar Splitting in Hybrid AC/DC Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Bastianel, Marta Vanin, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun</p>
            <p>Driven by global climate goals, an increasing amount of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is currently being installed worldwide. Especially in the context of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most effective technology to transmit this RES power over long distances. As hybrid AC/DC systems develop, they are expected to become increasingly complex and meshed as the current AC system. Nevertheless, there is still limited literature on how to optimize hybrid AC/DC topologies while minimizing the total power generation cost. For this reason, this paper proposes a methodology to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed. The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.</p>

            <p>This article investigates on the improvement and stabilization of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) output voltages in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a vertical-axis tidal turbine using advanced control strategies. The research integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to enhance voltage stability and efficiency. Initially, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach based on Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy logic controllers is explored. To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers. The hybrid ANN-PSO technique improves the voltage regulation by dynamically adapting to system variations and providing real-time reference speed adjustments. This research highlights the AI-based hybrid optimization benefit to stabilize the output voltage of tidal energy systems, thereby increasing reliability and efficiency in renewable energy applications.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Fuzzy Logic and Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization for Dynamic Photovoltaic Shading Faults Mitigation</h2>

            <p>Shading faults remain one of the most critical challenges affecting photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency, as they not only reduce power generation but also disturb maximum power point tracking (MPPT). To address this issue, this study introduces a hybrid optimization framework that combines Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) with a Shading-Aware Particle Swarm Optimization (SA-PSO) method. The proposed scheme is designed to adapt dynamically to both partial shading (20%-80%) and complete shading events, ensuring reliable global maximum power point (GMPP) detection. In this approach, the fuzzy controller provides rapid decision support based on shading patterns, while SA-PSO accelerates the search process and prevents the system from becoming trapped in local minima. A comparative performance assessment with the conventional Perturb and Observe (P\&O) algorithm highlights the advantages of the hybrid model, showing up to an 11.8% improvement in power output and a 62% reduction in tracking time. These results indicate that integrating intelligent control with shading-aware optimization can significantly enhance the resilience and energy yield of PV systems operating under complex real-world conditions.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing is poised to redefine the algorithmic foundations of communication systems. While quantum superposition and entanglement enable quadratic or exponential speedups for specific problems, identifying use cases where these advantages yield engineering benefits is still nontrivial. This article presents the fundamentals of quantum computing in a style familiar to the communications society, outlining the current limits of fault-tolerant quantum computing and clarifying a mathematical harmony between quantum and wireless systems, which makes the topic more enticing to wireless researchers. Based on a systematic review of pioneering and state-of-the-art studies indicating speedup opportunities, we distill common design trends for the research and development of quantum-accelerated communication systems and highlight lessons learned. The key insight is that quantum algorithms, including their gate-level realizations, can benefit from the design intuition applied in communication engineering. This article aims to catalyze interdisciplinary research at the frontier of quantum information processing and future communication systems.</p>

            <h2>6D Movable Metasurface (6DMM) in Downlink NOMA Transmissions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Hsiang Shen</p>
            <p>This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.</p>

            <h2>Online Energy Storage Arbitrage under Imperfect Predictions: A Conformal Risk-Aware Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiqian Wu, Ming Yi, Bolun Xu, James Anderson</p>
            <p>This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risk arising from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.</p>

            <h2>Sparse Neural Approximations for Bilevel Adversarial Problems in Power Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young-ho Cho, Harsha Nagarajan, Deepjyoti Deka, Hao Zhu</p>
            <p>The adversarial worst-case load shedding (AWLS) problem is pivotal for identifying critical contingencies under line outages. It is naturally cast as a bilevel program: the upper level simulates an attacker determining worst-case line failures, and the lower level corresponds to the defender's generator redispatch operations. Conventional techniques using optimality conditions render the bilevel, mixed-integer formulation computationally prohibitive due to the combinatorial number of topologies and the nonconvexity of AC power flow constraints. To address these challenges, we develop a novel single-level optimal value-function (OVF) reformulation and further leverage a data-driven neural network (NN) surrogate of the follower's optimal value. To ensure physical realizability, we embed the trained surrogate in a physics-constrained NN (PCNN) formulation that couples the OVF inequality with (relaxed) AC feasibility, yielding a mixed-integer convex model amenable to off-the-shelf solvers. To achieve scalability, we learn a sparse, area-partitioned NN via spectral clustering; the resulting block-sparse architecture scales essentially linearly with system size while preserving accuracy. Notably, our approach produces near-optimal worst-case failures and generalizes across loading conditions and unseen topologies, enabling rapid online recomputation. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 14- and 118-bus systems demonstrate the method's scalability and solution quality for large-scale contingency analysis, with an average optimality gap of 5.8% compared to conventional methods, while maintaining computation times under one minute.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Platoon Formation and Stable Benefit Allocation in Mixed-Energy Truck Fleets under Size Limitations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting Bai, Xinfeng Ru, Andreas A. Malikopoulos</p>
            <p>In this paper, we investigate cooperative platoon formation and benefit allocation in mixed-energy truck fleets composed of both electric and fuel-powered trucks. The central challenge arises from the platoon-size constraint, which limits the number of trucks permitted in each platoon and introduces combinatorial coupling into the search for optimal platoon formation structures. We formulate this problem as a coalitional game with bounded coalition sizes and derive a closed-form characterization of the optimal coalition structure that maximizes the fleet-wide platooning benefit. Building on this structure, we develop a type-based least-core payoff allocation scheme that guarantees stability within the coalition-structure core (CS-core). For cases in which the CS-core is empty, we compute the least-core radius to determine the minimal relaxation required to achieve approximate stability. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves the highest total platooning benefit among all feasible formation configurations while providing stable benefit allocations that outperform existing baseline methods.</p>

            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</p>

            <h2>From Forecast to Action: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Power Outages During Tropical Cyclones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongchuan Yang, Naiyu Wang, Zhenguo Wang, Min Ouyang, Can Wan</p>
            <p>Power outages caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) pose serious risks to electric power systems and the communities they serve. Accurate, high-resolution outage forecasting is essential for enabling both proactive mitigation planning and real-time emergency response. This study introduces the SpatioTemporal Outage ForeCAST (STO-CAST) model, a deep learning framework developed for real-time, regional-scale outage prediction during TC events with high-resolution outputs in both space and time. STO-CAST integrates static environmental and infrastructure attributes with dynamic meteorological and outage sequences using gated recurrent units (GRUs) and fully connected layers, and is trained via a Leave-One-Storm-Out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy along with holdout grid experiments to demonstrate its preliminary generalization capability to unseen storms and grids. The model produces hourly outage forecasts at a 4 km * 4 km resolution and supports dual forecasting modes: short-term nowcasting with a 6-hour lead time via assimilation of real-time observations, and long-term forecasting with a 60-hour lead time based on evolving meteorological projections. A case study on Typhoon Muifa (2022) demonstrates STO-CAST's operational effectiveness, including error decomposition across model design, meteorological uncertainty, and observation gaps, while highlighting the value of real-time data assimilation and the model's capacity to identify evolving outage hotspots. STO-CAST offers a scalable, data-driven solution to support risk-informed emergency response and enhance power system resilience under intensifying TC threats.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we first clarify the concepts of green AI versus frugal AI, positioning frugality as efficiency by design and green AI as transparency and accountability. We then argue that these approaches, while complementary, are insufficient without a shared quantitative foundation that links AI computing to power system contexts. This motivates the development of standardized carbon metrics as a bridge between algorithmic decisions and their physical consequences. We next embed these signals into scheduling and planning frameworks, presenting two architectures: (i) an iterative signal-response loop for real-time operations, and (ii) an integrated optimization that learns and encodes flexible-load behavior for long-term planning. Finally, we show how the same coordination stack supports resilience, enabling signals to shift from emissions-first to stability-first during stress events, providing targeted relief and faster restoration.</p>

            <p>Pose estimation of a robot arm from visual inputs is a challenging task. However, with the increasing adoption of robot arms for both industrial and residential use cases, reliable joint angle estimation can offer improved safety and performance guarantees, and also be used as a verifier to further train robot policies.

By evaluating frontier VLMs on both synthetic and real-world image-data pairs, this paper establishes a performance baseline attained by current FLMs. In addition, this paper presents empirical results suggesting that test time scaling or parameter scaling alone does not lead to improved joint angle predictions.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hansung Kim, Eric Yongkeun Choi, Eunhyek Joa, Hotae Lee, Linda Lim, Scott Moura, Francesco Borrelli</p>
            <p>Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</p>

            <h2>RIS-Assisted Generalized Receive Quadrature Spatial Modulation with Extension to Multicast Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad H. Dinan, Khatereh Nadali, Mark F. Flanagan</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted generalized receive quadrature spatial modulation (RIS-GRQSM) scheme to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of RIS-aided \textit{quadrature} spatial modulation (QSM) systems. By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.</p>

            <p>In commercial robotic systems, it is common to encounter a closed inner-loop torque controller that is not user-modifiable. However, the outer-loop controller, which sends kinematic commands such as position or velocity for the inner-loop controller to track, is typically exposed to users. In this work, we focus on the development of an easily integrated add-on at the outer-loop layer by combining disturbance rejection control and robust control barrier function for high-performance tracking and safe control of the whole dynamic system of an industrial manipulator. This is particularly beneficial when 1) the inner-loop controller is imperfect, unmodifiable, and uncertain; and 2) the dynamic model exhibits significant uncertainty. Stability analysis, formal safety guarantee proof, and hardware experiments with a PUMA robotic manipulator are presented. Our solution demonstrates superior performance in terms of simplicity of implementation, robustness, tracking precision, and safety compared to the state of the art. Video: this https URL</p>

            <p>Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings. To address these challenges, we propose SyncVoice, a vision-augmented video dubbing framework built upon a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Josue Andino, Milan Prodanovic, Javier Roldan-Perez</p>
            <p>The impedance criterion has emerged as an alternative way to stability assessment of grid-connected power electronic converters. However, the lack of physical meaning of impedance and admittance matrices hinders the ability to understand the root cause of instabilities. To address this issue, this paper proposes the application of Pauli decomposition to the impedance matrices and the minor loop of grid-connected power electronic converters. The application of this methodology simplifies establishing the link between impedance matrix terms and closed-loop stability properties. Moreover, Pauli decomposition transforms impedance matrices in a quaternion-like form that is helpful to assess the root cause of instabilities. The theoretical contributions are validated using a case study consisting of a power electronic converter connected to a weak grid that has been previously analysed in the literature using existing techniques.</p>

            <p>The increasing electric power consumption and the shift towards renewable energy resources demand for new ways to operate transmission and subtransmission grids. Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a feedback real-time control method that can be employed to enable optimal operation of these grids. Such controllers can maximize grid efficiency (e.g., minimizing curtailment) while satisfying grid constraints like voltage and current limits. The OFO control method is tailored and extended to handle discrete inputs and it is explained how to design an OFO controller for the subtransmission grid. A novel benchmark is presented and published that corresponds to the real French subtransmission grid on which the proposed controller is analyzed in terms of robustness against model mismatch, constraint satisfaction, and tracking performance. It is shown that OFO controllers can help utilize the grid to its full extent, virtually reinforce it, and operate it optimally and in real-time by using the flexibility offered by renewable generators connected to distribution grids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjian Tuo, Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>Day-ahead generation scheduling is typically conducted by solv-ing security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. However, with fast-growing of inverter-based resources, grid inertia has been dramatically reduced, compromising the dy-namic stability system. Traditional SCUC (T-SCUC), without any inertia requirements, may no longer be effective for renewa-bles-dominated grids. To address this, we propose the active linearized sparse neural network-embedded SCUC (ALSNN-SCUC) model, utilizing machine learning (ML) to incorporate system dynamic performance. A multi-output deep neural net-work (DNN) model is trained offline on strategically-selected data samples to accurately predict frequency stability metrics: locational RoCoF and frequency nadir. Structured sparsity and active ReLU linearization are implemented to prune redundant DNN neurons, significantly reducing its size while ensuring pre-diction accuracy even at high sparsity levels. By embedding this ML-based frequency stability predictor into SCUC as con-straints, the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model minimizes its com-putational complexity while ensuring frequency stability follow-ing G-1 contingency. Case studies show that the proposed ALSNN-SCUC can enforce pre-specified frequency requirements without being overly conservative, outperforming five bench-mark models including T-SCUC, two physics-based SCUC, and two ML-based SCUC. The proposed sparsification and active linearization strategies can reduce the DNN-SCUC computing time by over 95% for both IEEE 24-bus and 118-bus systems, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed ALSNN-SCUC model.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Power Scheduling for High Renewables-Integrated Energy Systems with Battery Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cunzhi Zhao, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>In high renewables-integrated power systems, irrespective to their sizes, energy storage is commonly included and utilized to mitigate fluctuations from both the load and renewable power generation, ensuring system reliability, among which battery energy storage system (BESS) are experiencing fast-growth in recent years. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithi-um-ion batteries, have been extensively deployed. The degrada-tion of these batteries significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately quantify the battery degrada-tion; however, the model complexity hinders their applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different scales. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach, in-troducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery deg-radation model (SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the scheduled BESS operational profiles. This approach achieves accurate degradation prediction while substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network model. The computational burden of day-ahead energy scheduling when integrating battery degradation can thus be substantially alleviated. Case studies, conducted on both small-scale microgrids and large-scale bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency and suitability of the proposed optimal energy scheduling model that can effectively address battery degrada-tion concerns while optimizing day-ahead energy scheduling op-erations.</p>

            <h2>Generation Expansion Planning with Upstream Supply Chain Constraints on Materials, Manufacturing, and Deployment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyu Yao, Andrey Bernstein, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Rising electricity demand underscores the need for secure and reliable generation expansion planning that accounts for upstream supply chain constraints. Traditional models often overlook limitations in materials, manufacturing capacity, lead times for deployment, and field availability, which can delay availability of planned resources and thus to threaten system reliability. This paper introduces a multi-stage supply chain-constrained generation expansion planning (SC-GEP) model that optimizes long-term investments while capturing material availability, production limits, spatial and temporal constraints, and material reuse from retired assets. A decomposition algorithm efficiently solves the resulting MILP. A Maryland case study shows that supply chain constraints shift technology choices, amplify deployment delays caused by lead times, and prompt earlier investment in shorter lead-time, low-material-intensity options. In the low-demand scenario, supply chain constraints raise investment costs by $1.2 billion. Under high demand, persistent generation and reserve shortfalls emerge, underscoring the need to integrate upstream constraints into long-term planning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amin Masoumi, Mert Korkali</p>
            <p>Dynamic security control (DSC) is considered a pivotal step for the future power grid, which is increasingly penetrated by inverter-based resources. However, the efficiency of such practices, whether governed by automatic generation control or virtual inertia scheduling, can be intractable due to the complexity of the problem and the need to solve the differentialalgebraic equation in a timely manner with the required accuracy. In this regard, the model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm demonstrates reliable performance. In addition, the introduction of fault-tolerant and near-term quantum computing terminologies, i.e., noisy intermediate-scale quantum, opens avenues for improving the performance of model-free algorithms leveraging quantum capabilities. This paper provides an organized framework and assesses its dependability by evaluating the performance of a quantum-embedded algorithm on the DSC of the IEEE 39-bus test system. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate promising applications, along with shortcomings that can be addressed and further developed later.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a direct comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for adaptive steam temperature control in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs), particularly under valve leakage faults. Maintaining precise steam temperature in HRSGs is critical for efficiency and safety, yet traditional control strategies struggle with nonlinear, fault-induced dynamics. Both architectures are designed to adaptively tune the gains of a PI-plus-feedforward control law in real-time. The LSTM controller, a purely data-driven approach, was trained offline on historical operational data, while the PINN controller integrates fundamental thermodynamic laws directly into its online learning process through a physics-based loss function. Their performance was evaluated using a model validated with data from a combined cycle power plant, under normal load changes and a challenging valve leakage fault scenario. Results demonstrate that while the LSTM controller offers significant improvement over conventional methods, its performance degrades under the unseen fault. The PINN controller consistently delivered superior robustness and performance, achieving a 54\% reduction in integral absolute error compared to the LSTM under fault conditions. This study concludes that embedding physical knowledge into data-driven control is essential for developing reliable, fault-tolerant autonomous control systems in complex industrial applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minsoo Kim, Vladimir Dvorkin, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) is an effective approach to enhancing the utilization of existing transmission line infrastructure by adapting line ratings according to real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecasts are essential for grid operators to effectively schedule generation, manage transmission congestion, and lower operating costs. As renewable generation becomes increasingly variable and weather-dependent, accurate DLR forecasts are also crucial for improving renewable utilization and reducing curtailment during congested periods. Deterministic forecasts, however, often inadequately represent actual line capacities under uncertain weather conditions, leading to operational risks and costly real-time adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel network-wide probabilistic DLR forecasting model that leverages both spatial and temporal information, significantly reducing the operational risks and inefficiencies inherent in deterministic methods. Case studies on a synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances grid reliability by effectively capturing true DLR values, but also substantially reduces operational costs.</p>

            <p>In modern power systems, frequency regulation is a fundamental prerequisite for ensuring system reliability and assessing the robustness of expansion projects. Conventional feedback control schemes, however, exhibit limited accuracy under varying operating conditions because their gains remain static. Consequently, deep reinforcement learning methods are increasingly employed to design adaptive controllers that can be generalized to diverse frequency control tasks. At the same time, recent advances in quantum computing provide avenues for embedding quantum capabilities into such critical applications. In particular, the potential of quantum algorithms can be more effectively explored and harnessed on near-term quantum devices by leveraging insights from active controller design. In this work, we incorporate a quantum circuit together with an ansatz into the operation of a deep deterministic policy gradient agent. The simulation results of the IEEE 14-bus test system demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach that can achieve reliable, robust performance across diverse real-world challenges.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing DER Aggregate Flexibility via Network Reconfiguration</h2>

            <p>The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology.</p>

            <p>Enhanced computational capabilities of modern decision-making software have allowed us to solve increasingly sophisticated optimisation problems. But in complex socio-economic, technical environments such as electricity markets, transparent operation is key to ensure a fair treatment of all parties involved, particularly regarding dispatch decisions. We address this issue by building on the concept of counterfactual explanations, answering questions such as "Why was this generator not dispatched?" by identifying minimum changes in the input parameters that would have changed the optimal solution. Both DC Optimal Power Flow and Unit Commitment problems are considered, wherein the variable parameters are the spatial and temporal demand profiles, respectively. The thereby obtained explanations allow users to identify the most important differences between the real and expected market outcomes and observe which constraints have led to the solution. The framework uses a bilevel optimisation problem to find the counterfactual demand scenarios. State-of-the-art methods are compared with data-driven heuristics on the basis of computational efficiency and explanation accuracy. Results show that leveraging historical data from previously solved instances can provide significant speed benefits and allows us to derive explanations in cases where conventional methods would not be tractable.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the joint scheduling problem of stochastic workloads and a hydrogen-enabled distributed energy system in a low-carbon Internet data centers (IDC). Although such workloads can be shifted over temporal and spatial horizons, it poses challenges when they cannot be accurately predicted, resulting in significant efficiency degradation and high operational cost of the energy system. The problem becomes even more difficult when the workload shifting decisions would influence their randomness, which is natural for the IDC workloads. To tackle these issues, we propose a workload classification model based on the decision-dependent uncertainty set, where the spatiotemporal elasticity of different types of random workloads are clearly identified and the decision dependencies are explicitly described as linear constraints. Thus, a mixed integer program is then established for the optimal scheduling of both workload demand and energy supply. To enhance system resilience against high volatility scenarios, a rolling horizon algorithm is developed to ensure nonanticipativity and full-scenario feasibility. Numerical tests demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits effective workload scheduling decisions with dramatic energy operational cost reductions compared to the benchmarks under most of the uncertain scenarios.</p>

            <p>Industrial installations across several sectors have seen a dramatic increase in productivity, accuracy and efficiency over the last decade due to expanded utilization of medium voltage, variable speed power electronic converters to drive their processes. Specifically, active front-end (AFE) drives have become popular due to their ability to deliver power while maintaining safe electrical setpoints. However, under abnormal grid conditions such as phase loss, conventional AFE control may fail to enforce safety constraints, potentially leading to drive shutdown and significant financial losses. In this work, we propose using reference-tracking Performance Boosting (rPB) to improve the resilience of standard AFE control to faults. This neural-network control framework provides a principled way to optimize transient performance while preserving the steady-state tracking properties of AFE-based drives. By carefully shaping the input signals to the rPB controller, we ensure that it activates only during grid faults, leaving nominal operation unaffected. Simulation results show that the proposed approach successfully maintains the DC bus voltage and the grid current within safe limits during single-phase loss events.</p>

Case studies on standard IEEE feeders and a real low-voltage (LV) network in Cyprus demonstrate high numerical accuracy with optimality gap below 0.1% and up to 2x faster runtimes compared to IPOPT.

By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), CaFTRA effectively eliminates real-time uplink feedback by predicting channel state information (CSI) based solely on user geolocation. We introduce a Learnable Queries-driven Transformer Network for CSI mapping from user geolocation, which utilizes multi-head attention and learnable query embeddings to accurately capture frequency-domain correlations among resource blocks (RBs), thereby significantly improving the precision of CSI prediction. Once base stations (BSs) adopt feedback-free transmission, their downlink transmission coverage can be significantly expanded due to the elimination of frequent uplink feedback. To enable efficient resource scheduling under such extensive-coverage scenarios, we apply a low-complexity many-to-one matching theory-based algorithm for efficient multi-BS association and multi-RB resource allocation, which is proven to converge to a stable matching within limited iterations. Simulation results demonstrate that CaFTRA achieves stable matching convergence and significant gains in spectral efficiency and user fairness compared to 5G, underscoring its potential value for 6G standardization efforts.</p>

            <h2>Doppler Robust Vortex Wavefront Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Liu, Wen-Xuan Long, M. R. Bhavani Shankar, Marco Moretti, Rui Chen, Björn Ottersten</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm for future wireless systems due to spectrum reuse, hardware sharing, and joint waveform design. In dynamic scenes, Doppler shifts degrade both sensing and communication, which is particularly critical for beam-sensitive orbital angular momentum (OAM) wavefronts. To address this, we propose a Doppler-robust ISAC framework, which first senses and then communicates. Specifically, in the sensing phase, multiple vortex modes are simultaneously transmitted via code-division mode-multiplexing (CDMM). To solve Doppler-induced inter-mode interference, we propose a velocity-consistency matching (VCM)-expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that jointly decodes the sensing matrix and estimates range, azimuth, elevation, and velocity for multiple moving targets. In the communication phase, the joint transmitter (Tx) beamforming and receiver (Rx) beam steering are configured from the estimated channel state information (CSI). We further quantify the sensing-communication allocation trade-off by evaluating how pilot length affects estimation accuracy, beam alignment, and spectral efficiency (SE). Simulation results show that the proposed VCM-EM and ISAC designs achieve higher sensing accuracy and communication SE than baseline schemes in dynamic scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Fault-Tolerant Control of Steam Temperature in HRSG Superheater under Actuator Fault Using a Sliding Mode Observer and PINN</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mojtaba Fanoodi, Farzaneh Abdollahi, Mahdi Aliyari Shoorehdeli</p>
            <p>This paper presents a novel fault-tolerant control framework for steam temperature regulation in Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) subject to actuator faults. Addressing the critical challenge of valve degradation in superheater spray attemperators, we propose a synergistic architecture comprising three components: (1) a Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) for estimation of unmeasured thermal states, (2) a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for estimating multiplicative actuator faults using physical laws as constraints, and (3) a one-sided Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that adapts to the estimated faults while minimizing excessive actuation. The key innovation lies in the framework of closed-loop physics-awareness, where the PINN continuously informs both the observer and controller about fault severity while preserving thermodynamic consistency. Rigorous uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) is established via Lyapunov analysis under practical assumptions. Validated on real HRSG operational data, the framework demonstrates effective fault adaptation, reduced temperature overshoot, and maintains steam temperature within 1°C of the setpoint under valve effectiveness loss. This work bridges control theory and physics-guided machine learning to deliver a practically deployable solution for power plant resilience, with extensions applicable to thermal systems subject to multiplicative faults.</p>

            <h2>Market share maximizing strategies of CAV fleet operators may cause chaos in our cities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Jamróz, Rafał Kucharski, David Watling</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities.</p>

            <h2>Design of 3D Beamforming and Deployment Strategies for ISAC-based HAPS Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue Zhang, Bang Huang, Mohamed-Slim Alouini</p>
            <p>This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory, along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue, we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches over benchmark schemes.</p>

            <h2>Channel Estimation for Downlink Communications Based on Dynamic Metasurface Antennas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amarilton L. Magalhães, Fazal E-Asim, André L. F. de Almeida, A. Lee Swindlehurst</p>
            <p>Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are emerging as a promising technology to enable energy-efficient, large array-based multi-antenna systems. This paper presents a simple channel estimation scheme for the downlink of a multiple-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MISO-OFDM) communication system exploiting DMAs. The proposed scheme extracts separate estimates of the wireless channel and the unknown waveguide propagation vector using a simple iterative algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. Obtaining decoupled estimates of the wireless channel and inner waveguide vector enables the isolation and compensation for its effect when designing the DMA beamformer, regardless of the wireless channel state, which evolves much faster due to its shorter coherence time and bandwidth. Additionally, our solution operates in a data-aided manner, delivering estimates of useful data symbols jointly with channel estimates, without requiring sequential pilot and data stages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore this CE approach. Numerical results corroborate the notable performance of the proposed scheme.</p>

            <p>High-precision localization and environmental sensing are essential for a new wave of applications, ranging from industrial automation and autonomous systems to augmented reality and remote healthcare. Conventional wireless methods, however, often face limitations in accuracy, reliability, and coverage, especially in complex non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key enabling technology, offering dynamic control over the radio propagation environment to overcome these challenges. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of RIS-aided localization and sensing, bridging fundamental theory with practical implementation. The core principles of the RIS technology are first described detailing how programmable metasurfaces can intelligently combat blockages, enhance signal diversity, and create virtual line-of-sight (LoS) links. The chapter then reviews a range of application scenarios where RISs can offer significant improvements. A significant portion of the chapter is dedicated to algorithmic methodologies, covering beam sweeping protocols, codebook-based techniques, and advanced optimization and machine learning strategies for both localization and sensing. To validate the theoretical concepts in real-world conditions, recent experimental results using an RIS prototype are detailed, showcasing the technology's efficacy and illustrating key performance trade-offs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Sneh, Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Snehil Gupta, Haroon R. Lone</p>
            <p>Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.</p>

            <h2>Hardware Distortion Aware Precoding for ISAC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murat Babek Salman, Emil Björnson, Özlem Tugfe Demir</p>
            <p>The impact of hardware impairments on the spectral efficiency of communication systems is well studied, but their effect on sensing performance remains unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the influence of hardware impairments on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in cluttered environments. We derive the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) and show that hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, which masks target echoes. The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming hardware- and clutter-induced limitations, demonstrating significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.</p>

            <h2>Fleet Size and Mix Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Mobile Fast Chargers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhang Motallebi Araghi, Armin Abdolmohammdi, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari</p>
            <p>The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging.</p>

            <h2>Modal Analysis of Core Inertial Dynamics: Re-evaluating Grid-Forming Control Design Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerardo Medrano, Santiago Cóbreces</p>
            <p>This paper employs modal analysis to study the core inertial dynamics of governor-controlled synchronous generators (GC-SG), droop-based grid-forming (GFM) converters, and their most fundamental interactions. The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements.</p>

            <h2>Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems with Applications to Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often (i) computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or (ii) infeasible due to the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP) to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We remark that the application of our proposed approach is limited to the class of SOF controllers in perturbed linear systems. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Moreover, such extensive numerical simulations corroborate that although we utilize a heuristic optimization method to compute the MDRP, it performs quite well in practice compared to an existing approximation method in the literature, namely the hybrid expansion-contraction (HEC) method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of multi-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the traditional SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less computational time.</p>

However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs.

In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.</p>

            <p>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS). The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free architectures.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a dissipativity-based framework for the joint design of distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs), providing robust performance guarantees for voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing across distributed generators (DGs). The closed-loop AC MG is represented as a networked system in which DGs, distribution lines, and loads function as interconnected subsystems linked through cyber-physical networks. Each DG utilizes a three-layer hierarchical control structure: a steady-state controller for operating point configuration, a local feedback controller for voltage tracking, and a distributed droop-free controller implementing normalized power consensus for frequency coordination and proportional power distribution. The operating point design is formulated as an optimization problem. Leveraging dissipativity theory, we derive necessary and sufficient subsystem dissipativity conditions. The global co-design is then cast as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization that jointly determines distributed controller parameters and sparse communication architecture while managing the highly nonlinear, coupled dq-frame dynamics characteristic of AC systems.</p>

            <p>The North American commercial electric vehicle (EV) sector is undergoing rapid expansion, with unit sales rising from 21,120 in 2022 to 36,491 in 2023 - a 73% increase, according to the International Energy Agency. However, this accelerating adoption brings emerging technical challenges. One critical concern is the impact of low to extreme winter temperatures (25 degree F to -25 degree F) on EV performance, including reduced energy efficiency and extended charging times. This paper presents a systematic analysis of commercial EV performance degradation under cold weather conditions and its broader implications on grid operations. Monte Carlo simulations, applied using real-world fleet parameters, indicate that approximately 200 MWh of additional daily energy demand may be required in the U.S. alone to offset efficiency losses during severe cold events. The resulting strain on an already stressed winter grid could exacerbate reliability risks. Moreover, increased harmonic distortion associated with cold weather charging behaviors has also been observed, raising concerns about power quality. To address these challenges, this study proposes two practical mitigation strategies: (1) a 'design-integrated safety' battery swapping station model operating in thermally controlled environments to significantly reduce charging downtime, and (2) a hybrid architecture combining roadside fast charging with depot-based deep charging to support continuous fleet utilization without compromising range. Together, these interventions provide a robust foundation for resilient commercial EV integration in cold climates, supporting fleet operators and utilities in managing seasonal performance variability.</p>

            <h2>Constraint-Aware Grid-Forming Control for Current Limiting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominic Groß</p>
            <p>This work develops a constraint-aware grid-forming (GFM) control that explicitly accounts for current limits and modulation limits within the GFM oscillator dynamics generating the GFM voltage reference (i.e., phase angle and magnitude). Broadly speaking, the voltage reference generated by the constraint-aware GFM control minimizes the deviation from conventional unconstrained GFM droop control, while respecting current and modulation limits. The resulting GFM control achieves fast current limiting while preserving transient stability, e.g., exhibiting infinite critical clearing time. To develop the control, we first characterize and analyze the set of converter voltages that do not result in constraint violations. Next, an efficient algorithm for projecting voltages onto the feasible set is developed. Subsequently, these results are used to restrict the dynamics of GFM droop control to the set of feasible voltages. Finally, detailed simulation studies and hardware experiments are used to illustrate and validate the response to short-circuit faults and phase jumps.</p>

            <h2>Frequency-Dynamics-Aware Economic Dispatch with Optimal Grid-Forming Inverter Allocation and Reserved Power Headroom</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Jiang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) reduces system inertia, leading to frequency stability concerns, especially during synchronous generator (SG) outages. To maintain frequency dynamics within secure limits while ensuring economic efficiency, frequency-constrained optimal power flow (FCOPF) is employed. However, existing studies either neglect the frequency support capability and allocation of grid-forming (GFM) IBRs or suffer from limited accuracy in representing frequency dynamics due to model simplifications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL)-based FCOPF (DL-FCOPF) framework. A DL model is first developed as a predictor to accurately estimate frequency-related metrics: the required reserved headroom and allocation of GFM IBRs, the rate of change of frequency and frequency nadir. After being trained with data obtained from electromagnetic transient simulations, the DL model is reformulated and incorporated into FCOPF. Case studies conducted on two test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared with the traditional OPF and linear FCOPF benchmarks, the DL-FCOPF can optimally coordinate SGs and IBRs with minimum cost, achieving desired frequency response, within an acceptable computing time. Further-more, sensitivity analyses are conducted to identify the most suit-able structure and linearization approach of the DL-based frequency predictor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bailiang Jian, Jiazhen Pan, Rohit Jena, Morteza Ghahremani, Hongwei Bran Li, Daniel Rueckert, Christian Wachinger, Benedikt Wiestler</p>
            <p>Medical image registration drives quantitative analysis across organs, modalities, and patient populations. Recent deep learning methods often combine low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks from computer vision, such as large-kernel CNNs, Transformers, and state-space models, with high-level registration-specific designs like motion pyramids, correlation layers, and iterative refinement. Yet, their relative contributions remain unclear and entangled. This raises a central question: should future advances in registration focus on importing generic architectural trends or on refining domain-specific design principles? Through a modular framework spanning brain, lung, cardiac, and abdominal registration, we systematically disentangle the influence of these two paradigms. Our evaluation reveals that low-level "trend-driven" computational blocks offer only marginal or inconsistent gains, while high-level registration-specific designs consistently deliver more accurate, smoother, and more robust deformations. These domain priors significantly elevate the performance of a standard U-Net baseline, far more than variants incorporating "trend-driven" blocks, achieving an average relative improvement of $\sim3\%$. All models and experiments are released within a transparent, modular benchmark that enables plug-and-play comparison for new architectures and registration tasks (this https URL). This dynamic and extensible platform establishes a common ground for reproducible and fair evaluation, inviting the community to isolate genuine methodological contributions from domain priors. Our findings advocate a shift in research emphasis: from following architectural trends to embracing domain-specific design principles as the true drivers of progress in learning-based medical image registration.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty quantification in load profiles with rising EV and PV adoption: the case of residential, industrial, and office buildings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiko Fias, Md Umar Hashmi, Geert Deconinck</p>
            <p>The integration of photovoltaic (PV) generation and electric vehicle (EV) charging intro- duces significant uncertainty in electricity consumption patterns, particularly at the distribution level. This paper presents a comparative study for selecting metrics for uncertainty quantification (UQ) for net load profiles of residential, industrial, and office buildings under increased DER penetration. A variety of statistical metrics is evaluated for their usefulness in quantifying un- certainty, including, but not limited to, standard deviation, entropy, ramps, and distance metrics. The proposed metrics are classified into baseline-free, with baseline and error-based. These UQ metrics are evaluated for increased penetration of EV and PV. The results highlight suitable metrics to quantify uncertainty per consumer type and demonstrate how net load uncertainty is affected by EV and PV adoption. Additionally, it is observed that joint consideration of EV and PV can reduce overall uncertainty due to compensatory effects of EV charging and PV generation due to temporal alignment during the day. Uncertainty reduction is observed across all datasets and is most pronounced for the office building dataset.</p>

            <p>Power consumption has become a critical aspect of modern life due to the consistent reliance on technological advancements. Reducing power consumption or following power usage predictions can lead to lower monthly costs and improved electrical reliability. The proposal of a holistic framework to establish a foundation for IoT systems with a focus on contextual decision making, proactive adaptation, and scalable structure. A structured process for IoT systems with accuracy and interconnected development would support reducing power consumption and support grid stability. This study presents the feasibility of this proposal through the application of each aspect of the framework. This system would have long term forecasting, short term forecasting, anomaly detection, and consideration of qualitative data with any energy management decisions taken. Performance was evaluated on Power Consumption Time Series data to display the direct application of the framework.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive prediction theory combining offline and online learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haizheng Li, Lei Guo</p>
            <p>Real-world intelligence systems usually operate by combining offline learning and online adaptation with highly correlated and non-stationary system data or signals, which, however, has rarely been investigated theoretically in the literature. This paper initiates a theoretical investigation on the prediction performance of a two-stage learning framework combining offline and online algorithms for a class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. For the offline-learning phase, we establish an upper bound on the generalization error for approximate nonlinear-least-squares estimation under general datasets with strong correlation and distribution shift, leveraging the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the distributional discrepancies. For the online-adaptation phase, we address, on the basis of the offline-trained model, the possible uncertain parameter drift in real-world target systems by proposing a meta-LMS prediction algorithm. This two-stage framework, integrating offline learning with online adaptation, demonstrates superior prediction performances compared with either purely offline or online methods. Both theoretical guarantees and empirical studies are provided.</p>

            <h2>Time-Series at the Edge: Tiny Separable CNNs for Wearable Gait Detection and Optimal Sensor Placement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Procopio, Marco Esposito, Sara Raggiunto, Andrey Gizdov, Alberto Belli, Paola Pierleoni</p>
            <p>We study on-device time-series analysis for gait detection in Parkinson's disease (PD) from short windows of triaxial acceleration, targeting resource-constrained wearables and edge nodes. We compare magnitude thresholding to three 1D CNNs for time-series analysis: a literature baseline (separable convolutions) and two ultra-light models - one purely separable and one with residual connections. Using the BioStampRC21 dataset, 2 s windows at 30 Hz, and subject-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on 16 PwPD with chest-worn IMUs, our residual separable model (Model 2, 533 params) attains PR-AUC = 94.5%, F1 = 91.2%, MCC = 89.4%, matching or surpassing the baseline (5,552 params; PR-AUC = 93.7%, F1 = 90.5%, MCC = 88.5%) with approximately 10x fewer parameters. The smallest model (Model 1, 305 params) reaches PR-AUC = 94.0%, F1 = 91.0%, MCC = 89.1%. Thresholding obtains high recall (89.0%) but low precision (76.5%), yielding many false positives and high inter-subject variance. Sensor-position analysis (train-on-all) shows chest and thighs are most reliable; forearms degrade precision/recall due to non-gait arm motion; naive fusion of all sites does not outperform the best single site. Both compact CNNs execute within tight memory/latency budgets on STM32-class MCUs (sub-10 ms on low-power boards), enabling on-sensor gating of transmission/storage. Overall, ultra-light separable CNNs provide a superior accuracy-efficiency-generalization trade-off to fixed thresholds for wearable PD gait detection and underscore the value of tailored time-series models for edge deployment.</p>

            <h2>TenonOS: A Self-Generating Intelligent Embedded Operating System Framework for Edge Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinkui Zhao, Yifan Zhang, Haidan Zhao, Hao Zhang, Qingyu Ma, Lufei Zhang, Guanjie Cheng, Shuiguang Deng, Jianwei Yin, Zuoning Chen</p>
            <p>The rapid evolution of edge computing has exposed fundamental limitations in traditional operating system and hypervisor architectures, particularly in managing heterogeneous platforms and meeting the constraints of limited resources. Existing solutions often rely on monolithic or layered combinations of hypervisors and guest OSes, which are difficult to tailor for the diverse and dynamic requirements of edge scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose TenonOS, a demand-driven, self-generating, and lightweight operating system framework that fundamentally rethinks and reconstructs both the hypervisor and OS architectures. TenonOS introduces a novel LibOS-on-LibOS approach, in which both virtualization and OS functionalities are modularized into fine-grained, reusable micro-libraries. A dynamic orchestration engine composes these modules on demand to construct customized, application-specific runtime environments. At the core of TenonOS are two key components: Mortise, a minimal, modularized hypervisor, and Tenon, a real-time LibOS. Mortise provides low-overhead resource isolation, fast inter-VM communication, and manages the full lifecycle of Tenon instances - including on-demand creation, suspension, and termination - enabling TenonOS to flexibly adapt its runtime layout to workload variations. Tenon delivers deterministic scheduling and multi-process support for time-critical applications. Through this unified and modular architecture, TenonOS eliminates redundant layers, reduces system overhead, and enhances scalability, security, and maintainability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TenonOS achieves superior real-time scheduling (40.28% improvement), a compact memory footprint (361 KiB), and high adaptability to dynamic edge workloads, making it an ideal foundation for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijia Liu, Ancheng Hou, Shaoyuan Li, Xiang Yin</p>
            <p>Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) provides a rigorous framework for complex robotic tasks, yet existing methods often rely on accurate dynamics models or expensive online interactions. In this work, we address LTL-constrained control in a challenging offline, model-free setting, utilizing only fixed, task-agnostic datasets of fragmented trajectories. We propose SAGAS, a novel framework combining graph-assisted trajectory stitching with automata-guided planning. First, we construct a latent reachability graph from a learned temporal-distance representation. To bridge the semantic gap, we augment this graph with certified anchor nodes and probabilistic soft labels. We then translate the specification into a Büchi automaton and search the implicit product space to derive a cost-minimal prefix-suffix plan. Finally, a subgoal-conditioned low-level policy is deployed to execute these latent waypoints. Experiments on OGBench locomotion domains demonstrate that SAGAS successfully synthesizes efficient trajectories for diverse LTL tasks, effectively bridging the gap between fragmented offline data and complex logical constraints.</p>

            <h2>A Novel MDP Decomposition Framework for Scalable UAV Mission Planning in Complex and Uncertain Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Muzakkir Quamar, Ali Nasir, Sami ELFerik</p>
            <p>This paper presents a scalable and fault-tolerant framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission management in complex and uncertain environments. The proposed approach addresses the computational bottleneck inherent in solving large-scale Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by introducing a two-stage decomposition strategy. In the first stage, a factor-based algorithm partitions the global MDP into smaller, goal-specific sub-MDPs by leveraging domain-specific features such as goal priority, fault states, spatial layout, and energy constraints. In the second stage, a priority-based recombination algorithm solves each sub-MDP independently and integrates the results into a unified global policy using a meta-policy for conflict resolution. Importantly, we present a theoretical analysis showing that, under mild probabilistic independence assumptions, the combined policy is provably equivalent to the optimal global MDP policy. Our work advances artificial intelligence (AI) decision scalability by decomposing large MDPs into tractable subproblems with provable global equivalence. The proposed decomposition framework enhances the scalability of Markov Decision Processes, a cornerstone of sequential decision-making in artificial intelligence, enabling real-time policy updates for complex mission environments. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time without sacrificing mission reliability or policy optimality. The proposed framework establishes a practical and robust foundation for scalable decision-making in real-time UAV mission execution.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Causal Foundation Model in Prescriptive Maintenance Framework for Optimizing Production Line OEE</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Saretzky, Lucas Andersen, Thomas Engel, Fazel Ansari</p>
            <p>The transition to prescriptive maintenance in manufacturing is critically constrained by a dependence on predictive models. These models tend to rely on spurious correlations rather than identifying the true causal drivers of failures, often leading to costly misdiagnoses and ineffective interventions. This fundamental limitation results in a key-challenge: while we can predict that a failure may occur, we lack a systematic method to understand why a failure occurs, thereby providing the basis for identifying the most effective intervention. This paper proposes a model based on causal machine learning to bridge this gap. Our objective is to move beyond diagnosis to active prescription by simulating and evaluating potential fixes toward optimizing KPIs such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). For this purpose a pre-trained causal foundation model is used as a "what-if" model to estimate the effects of potential fixes. By measuring the causal effect of each intervention on system-level KPIs, it provides a data-driven ranking of actions to recommend at the production line. This process not only identifies root causes but also quantifies their operational impact. The model is evaluated using semi-synthetic manufacturing data and compared with a baseline machine learning model. This paper sets the technical basis for a robust prescriptive maintenance framework, allowing engineers to test potential solutions in a causal environment to make more effective operational decisions and reduce costly downtimes.</p>

            <p>Continuous energy monitoring is essential for identifying potential savings and predicting the energy requirements of buildings. Energy meters are often located in underground spaces that are difficult to reach with wireless technology. This paper presents an experimental study comparing different Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) technologies in terms of building penetration and radio coverage. The technologies Low Power Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWAN), Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Sigfox 0G and Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks (Wi-SUN) are evaluated experimentally. It also proposes a distributed hybrid IoT architecture that combines multiple LPWAN technologies using an abstraction layer to optimize cost and coverage. Communication is message-based using the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. It is implemented using the MQTT protocol. The abstraction layer decodes the proprietary binary data and converts it to a normalized JSON format.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian dynamic scheduling of multipurpose batch processes under incomplete look-ahead information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taicheng Zheng, Dan Li, Jie Li</p>
            <p>Multipurpose batch processes become increasingly popular in manufacturing industries since they adapt to low-volume, high-value products and shifting demands. These processes often operate in a dynamic environment, which faces disturbances such as processing delays and demand changes. To minimise long-term cost and system nervousness (i.e., disruptive changes to schedules), schedulers must design rescheduling strategies to address such disturbances effectively. Existing methods often assume complete look-ahead information over the scheduling horizon. This assumption contrasts with realistic situations where schedulers can only access incomplete look-ahead information. Sticking with existing methods may lead to suboptimal long-term costs and high-level system nervousness. In this work we propose a Bayesian dynamic scheduling method. Our method relies on learning a Bayesian Network from the probability distribution of disturbances. Specifically, the Bayesian Network represents how likely each operation will be impacted by disturbances. During the online execution, when new disturbances become observed, this method updates the posterior distribution and therefore guides the rescheduling strategy. We compare our method with the existing periodic rescheduling strategy (which generates new schedules from scratch at fixed intervals) on four benchmark problems. Computational results show that our method achieves statistically better long-term costs and system nervousness. In the theoretical aspect, we prove that if disturbances are mutually independent, the impact-quantifying variables inherently satisfy the independence assumptions required by Bayesian Networks. As an implication, practitioners can extend the method to other scheduling problems (such as job shop scheduling and continuous processes), given that they define the problem-specific dependencies between operations.</p>

            <p>This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control strategy for adaptive lighting regulation in controlled environments using a low-power microcontroller. A model-free Q-learning algorithm was implemented to dynamically adjust the brightness of a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) based on real-time feedback from a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The system was trained to stabilize at 13 distinct light intensity levels (L1 to L13), with each target corresponding to a specific range within the 64-state space derived from LDR readings. A total of 130 trials were conducted, covering all target levels with 10 episodes each. Performance was evaluated in terms of convergence speed, steps taken, and time required to reach target states. Box plots and histograms were generated to analyze the distribution of training time and learning efficiency across targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that the agent could effectively learn to stabilize at varying light levels with minimal overshooting and smooth convergence, even in the presence of environmental perturbations. This work highlights the feasibility of lightweight, on-device RL for energy-efficient lighting control and sets the groundwork for multi-modal environmental control applications in resource-constrained agricultural systems.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a new family of multi-parent recombination operators for Genetic Algorithms (GAs), based on normalized Pascal (binomial) coefficients. Unlike classical two-parent crossover operators, Pascal-Weighted Recombination (PWR) forms offsprings as structured convex combination of multiple parents, using binomially shaped weights that emphasize central inheritance while suppressing disruptive variance. We develop a mathematical framework for PWR, derive variance-transfer properties, and analyze its effect on schema survival. The operator is extended to real-valued, binary/logit, and permutation representations. We evaluate the proposed method on four representative benchmarks: (i) PID controller tuning evaluated using the ITAE metric, (ii) FIR low-pass filter design under magnitude-response constraints, (iii) wireless power-modulation optimization under SINR coupling, and (iv) the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We demonstrate how, across these benchmarks, PWR consistently yields smoother convergence, reduced variance, and achieves 9-22% performance gains over standard recombination operators. The approach is simple, algorithm-agnostic, and readily integrable into diverse GA architectures.</p>

            <p>Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.</p>

            <h2>Value of Communication in Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: A Pareto Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiping Luo, Bowen Li, Nikolaos Pappas</p>
            <p>Emerging cyber-physical systems increasingly operate under stringent communication constraints that preclude the reliable transmission of their extensive machine-type data streams. Since raw measurements often contain correlated or redundant components, effective operation depends not on transmitting all available data but on selecting the information that contributes to achieving the objectives of the system. Beyond accuracy, goal-oriented semantic communication assesses the \emph{value of information} and aims to generate and transmit only what is relevant and at the right time. Motivated by this perspective, this work studies the \emph{value of communication} through the canonical setting of remote estimation of Markov sources, where a value-of-information measure quantifies the relevance of information. We investigate how optimal estimation performance varies with the available communication budget and determine the marginal performance gain attributable to additional communication. Our approach is based on a \emph{Pareto analysis} that characterizes the complete set of policies that achieve optimal trade-offs between estimation performance and communication cost. The value of communication is defined as the absolute slope of the resulting Pareto frontier. Although computing this frontier is non-trivial, we demonstrate that in our setting it admits a notably tractable structure: it is strictly decreasing, convex, and piecewise linear, and its slope is governed by a finite collection of constants. Moreover, each Pareto-optimal operating point is realizable as a convex combination of two stationary deterministic policies, enabling practical implementation. Leveraging these structural insights, we introduce SPLIT, an efficient and provably optimal algorithm for constructing the complete Pareto frontier.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tal Shuster, Eliya Nachmani</p>
            <p>Recent neural audio codecs have achieved impressive reconstruction quality, typically relying on quantization methods such as Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Vector Quantization (VQ) and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ). However, these quantization techniques limit the geometric structure of the latent space, make it harder to capture correlations between features leading to inefficiency in representation learning, codebook utilization and token rate. In this paper we introduce Two Dimensional Quantization (Q2D2), a quantization scheme in which feature pairs are projected onto structured 2D grids such as hexagonal, rhombic, or rectangular tiling and quantized to the nearest grid values, yielding an implicit codebook defined by the product of grid levels, with codebook sizes comparable to conventional methods. Despite its simple geometric formulation, Q2D2 improves audio compression efficiency, with low token rates and high codebook utilization while maintaining state of the art reconstruction quality. Specifically, Q2D2 achieves competitive to superior performance in various objective and subjective reconstruction metrics, across extensive experiments in speech domain compared to state of the art models. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design choices.</p>

            <p>Combined effects of transient ionizing and electromagnetic pulse on vertical NPN bipolar transistor were experimentally investigated under pulsed X-ray irradiation. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation method was also employed to explore the underlying physical mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the collector (CEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation exceeds the linear superposition of their individual effects. Conversely, the combined effect of a positive pulse injected into the base (BEMP) and pulsed X-ray irradiation aligns closely with the results observed under BEMP acting alone. Mechanism analysis reveals that when CEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, there is a significant increase in both the drift photocurrent at the collector junction and the diffusion photocurrent near the collector junction. However, when BEMP and pulsed X-ray irradiation act simultaneously, these photocurrent components remain small, leading to a combined effect similar to the results observed when BEMP acts alone. These findings provide critical insights for the radiation-hardening design of bipolar circuits in harsh radiation environments.</p>

            <p>Securing the near-real-time (near-RT) control operations in Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) is increasingly critical, yet remains insufficiently addressed, as new runtime threats target the control loop while the system is operational. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer defence framework designed to enhance the security of near-RT RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) operations. We classify operational-time threats into three categories, message-level, data-level, and control logic-level, and design and implement a dedicated detection and mitigation component for each: a signature-based E2 message inspection module performing structural and semantic validation of signalling exchanges, a telemetry poisoning detector based on temporal anomaly scoring using an LSTM network, and a runtime xApp attestation mechanism based on execution-time hash challenge-response. The framework is evaluated on an O-RAN testbed comprising FlexRIC and a commercial RAN emulator, demonstrating effective detection rates, low latency overheads, and practical integration feasibility. Results indicate that the proposed safeguards can operate within near-RT time constraints while significantly improving protection against runtime attacks, introducing less than 80 ms overhead for a network with 500 User Equipment (UEs). Overall, this work lays the foundation for deployable, layered, and policy-driven runtime security architectures for the near-RT RIC control loop in Open RAN, and provides an extensible framework into which future mitigation policies and threat-specific modules can be integrated.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian Ambiguity Contraction-based Adaptive Robust Markov Decision Processes for Adversarial Surveillance Missions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimin Choi, Max Z. Li</p>
            <p>Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs) are envisioned to enable autonomous Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions in contested environments, where adversaries may act strategically to deceive or evade detection. These missions pose challenges due to model uncertainty and the need for safe, real-time decision-making. Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide worst-case guarantees but are limited by static ambiguity sets that capture initial uncertainty without adapting to new observations. This paper presents an adaptive RMDP framework tailored to ISR missions with CCAs. We introduce a mission-specific formulation in which aircraft alternate between movement and sensing states. Adversarial tactics are modeled as a finite set of transition kernels, each capturing assumptions about how adversarial sensing or environmental conditions affect rewards. Our approach incrementally refines policies by eliminating inconsistent threat models, allowing agents to shift from conservative to aggressive behaviors while maintaining robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the adaptive planner converges as credible sets contract to the true threat and maintains safety under uncertainty. Experiments under Gaussian and non-Gaussian threat models across diverse network topologies show higher mission rewards and fewer exposure events compared to nominal and static robust planners.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Log-Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function for Safe Robotic Navigation in Dynamic Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Yin, Chenyang Liang, Yanning Guo, Jie Mei</p>
            <p>Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as efficient tools to address the safe navigation problem for robot applications. However, synthesizing informative and obstacle motion-aware CBFs online using real-time sensor data remains challenging, particularly in unknown and dynamic scenarios. Motived by this challenge, this paper aims to propose a novel Gaussian Process-based formulation of CBF, termed the Dynamic Log Gaussian Process Control Barrier Function (DLGP-CBF), to enable real-time construction of CBF which are both spatially informative and responsive to obstacle motion. Firstly, the DLGP-CBF leverages a logarithmic transformation of GP regression to generate smooth and informative barrier values and gradients, even in sparse-data regions. Secondly, by explicitly modeling the DLGP-CBF as a function of obstacle positions, the derived safety constraint integrates predicted obstacle velocities, allowing the controller to proactively respond to dynamic obstacles' motion. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in obstacle avoidance performance, including increased safety margins, smoother trajectories, and enhanced responsiveness compared to baseline methods.</p>

            <p>Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.</p>

            <p>Multi-sensor Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is essential for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) performing agricultural tasks such as spraying, surveying, and inspection. However, real-world, multi-modal agricultural UAV datasets that enable research on robust operation remain scarce. To address this gap, we present AgriLiRa4D, a multi-modal UAV dataset designed for challenging outdoor agricultural environments. AgriLiRa4D spans three representative farmland types-flat, hilly, and terraced-and includes both boundary and coverage operation modes, resulting in six flight sequence groups. The dataset provides high-accuracy ground-truth trajectories from a Fiber Optic Inertial Navigation System with Real-Time Kinematic capability (FINS_RTK), along with synchronized measurements from a 3D LiDAR, a 4D Radar, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), accompanied by complete intrinsic and extrinsic calibrations. Leveraging its comprehensive sensor suite and diverse real-world scenarios, AgriLiRa4D supports diverse SLAM and localization studies and enables rigorous robustness evaluation against low-texture crops, repetitive patterns, dynamic vegetation, and other challenges of real agricultural environments. To further demonstrate its utility, we benchmark four state-of-the-art multi-sensor SLAM algorithms across different sensor combinations, highlighting the difficulty of the proposed sequences and the necessity of multi-modal approaches for reliable UAV localization. By filling a critical gap in agricultural SLAM datasets, AgriLiRa4D provides a valuable benchmark for the research community and contributes to advancing autonomous navigation technologies for agricultural UAVs.

            <p>In today's digital age, access to the Internet is essential, yet a significant digital divide exists, particularly in rural areas of developing nations. This paper presents a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) framework that utilizes informal public transportation systems, such as minibus taxis, as mobile data mules to enhance connectivity in these underserved regions. We develop a probabilistic model to capture the randomness in vehicle mobility, including travel times and contact durations at bus stops. Key performance metrics are analyzed, including average data transmission rate and Peak Age of Information (PAoI), to assess the effectiveness of the proposed system. An analytical approximation for the Mean PAoI (MPAoI) is derived and validated through simulations. Case studies from real-world datasets in Nouakchott, Accra, and Addis Ababa demonstrate the practical applicability and scalability of our framework. The findings indicate that leveraging existing transportation networks can significantly bridge the digital divide by providing reliable internet-like connectivity to remote areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Shakouri, Henk J. van Waarde, M. Kanat Camlibel</p>
            <p>In this paper, we consider the problem of designing input signals for an unknown linear time-invariant system in such a way that the resulting input-state data is suitable for identification or stabilization. We will take into account prior knowledge on system-theoretic properties of the system, in particular, controllability and stabilizability. For this, we extend the notion of universal inputs to incorporate prior knowledge on the system. An input is called universal for identification (resp., stabilization) if, when applied to any system complying with the prior knowledge, it results in data suitable for identification (resp., stabilization) regardless of the initial condition. We provide a full characterization of such universal inputs. In addition, we discuss online experiment design using prior knowledge, and we study cases where this approach results in the shortest possible experiment for identification and stabilization.</p>

            <p>Autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) must navigate safely in cluttered environments while accounting for complex dynamics and environmental uncertainty. Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) offers formal safety guarantees through the computation of forward and backward reachable sets, but its application is hindered by poor scalability in environments with numerous obstacles. In this paper, we present a novel framework called NeuroHJR that leverages Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to approximate the HJR solution for real-time obstacle avoidance. By embedding system dynamics and safety constraints directly into the neural network loss function, our method bypasses the need for grid-based discretization and enables efficient estimation of reachable sets in continuous state spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulation results in densely cluttered scenarios, showing that it achieves safety performance comparable to that of classical HJR solvers while significantly reducing the computational cost. This work provides a new step toward real-time, scalable deployment of reachability-based obstacle avoidance in robotics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eunjeong Jeong, Giovanni Perin, Howard H. Yang, Nikolaos Pappas</p>
            <p>Federated Learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices faces a critical challenge: The computational energy required for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often dominates communication costs. However, most existing Energy-Harvesting FL (EHFL) strategies fail to account for this reality, resulting in wasted energy due to redundant local computations. For efficient and proactive resource management, algorithms that predict local update contributions must be devised. We propose a lightweight client scheduling framework using the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a semantics-aware metric that quantifies update timeliness and significance. Crucially, we overcome VAoI's typical prohibitive computational cost, which requires statistical distance over the entire parameter space, by introducing a feature-based proxy. This proxy estimates model redundancy using intermediate-layer extraction from a single forward pass, dramatically reducing computational complexity. Experiments conducted under extreme non-IID data distributions and scarce energy availability demonstrate superior learning performance while achieving energy reduction compared to existing baseline selection policies. Our framework establishes semantics-aware scheduling as a practical and vital solution for EHFL in realistic scenarios where training costs dominate transmission costs.</p>

            <p>The stock market presents a challenging environment for accurately predicting future stock prices due to its intricate and ever-changing nature. However, the utilization of advanced methodologies can significantly enhance the precision of stock price predictions. One such method is Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs are statistical models that can be used to model the behavior of a partially observable system, making them suitable for modeling stock prices based on historical data. Accurate stock price predictions can help traders make better investment decisions, leading to increased profits. In this article, we trained and tested a Hidden Markov Model for the purpose of predicting a stock closing price based on its opening price and the preceding day's prices. The model's performance has been evaluated using two indicators: Mean Average Prediction Error (MAPE), which specifies the average accuracy of our model, and Directional Prediction Accuracy (DPA), a newly introduced indicator that accounts for the number of fractional change predictions that are correct in sign.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeke Zexi Hu, Xiaoming Chen, Vera Yuk Ying Chung, Yiran Shen</p>
            <p>The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the foundational component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets, and it offers a favorable balance between model performance and efficiency, yielding higher-quality LFSR results with substantially lower demand for memory and computation. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linrui Dai, Rongzhao Zhang, Yongrui Yu, Xiaofan Zhang</p>
            <p>The recently emerging conditional diffusion models seem promising for mitigating the labor and expenses in building large 3D medical imaging datasets. However, previous studies on 3D CT generation primarily focus on specific organs characterized by a local structure and fixed contrast and have yet to fully capitalize on the benefits of both semantic and textual conditions. In this paper, we present GuideGen, a controllable framework based on easily-acquired text prompts to generate anatomical masks and corresponding CT volumes for the entire torso-from chest to pelvis. Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; an anatomy-aware high-dynamic-range (HDR) autoencoder for high-fidelity feature extraction across varying intensity levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. Combined, these components enable data synthesis for segmentation tasks from only textual instructions. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mazen Elsaadany, Hamid R. Ossareh, Mads R. Almassalkhi</p>
            <p>Aggregations of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), such as air conditioners, offer valuable flexibility to the power grid. The aggregate power consumption of a TCL fleet can be controlled by adjusting thermostat setpoints. An ex-ante quantification of the flexibility that results from such setpoint change can inform grid operator decisions. This paper develops a rigorous, yet practical method to quantify flexibility in terms of the `reach-and-hold' set of TCL aggregations, which defines how much power can be shifted (reach) and for how long (hold). To quantify the reach-and-hold set, we employ a Markov-chain-based model of the TCL aggregation that captures second-order TCL dynamics, enabling accurate characterization of reach-and-hold sets. A tractable optimization problem is then formulated to numerically compute an inner approximation of these sets. Simulation results validate that our method accurately characterizes the fleet's flexibility and effectively controls its power consumption. Furthermore, a robustness analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of uncertainty in initial conditions and TCL parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoguang Huang, Yunzhen Wang, Haijin Zeng, Hongyu Chen, Hongyan Zhang</p>
            <p>Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multispectral images (MSIs) using a single coded two-dimensional (2-D) measurement, but reconstructing high-fidelity MSIs from these compressed inputs remains a fundamentally ill-posed challenge. While diffusion-based reconstruction methods have recently raised the bar for quality, they face critical limitations: a lack of large-scale MSI training data, adverse domain shifts from RGB-pretrained models, and inference inefficiencies due to multi-step sampling. These drawbacks restrict their practicality in real-world applications. In contrast to existing methods, which either follow costly iterative refinement or adapt subspace-based embeddings for diffusion models (e.g. DiffSCI, PSR-SCI), we introduce a fundamentally different paradigm: a self-supervised One-Step Diffusion (OSD) framework specifically designed for SCI. The key novelty lies in using a single-step diffusion refiner to correct an initial reconstruction, eliminating iterative denoising entirely while preserving generative quality. Moreover, we adopt a self-supervised equivariant learning strategy to train both the predictor and refiner directly from raw 2-D measurements, enabling generalization to unseen domains without the need for ground-truth MSI. To further address the challenge of limited MSI data, we design a band-selection-driven distillation strategy that transfers core generative priors from large-scale RGB datasets, effectively bridging the domain gap. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach sets a new benchmark, yielding PSNR gains of 3.44 dB, 1.61 dB, and 0.28 dB on the Harvard, NTIRE, and ICVL datasets, respectively, while reducing reconstruction time by 97.5%. This remarkable improvement in efficiency and adaptability makes our method a significant advancement in SCI reconstruction, combining both accuracy and practicality for real-world deployment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunbochen Tang, Themistoklis Sapsis, Navid Azizan</p>
            <p>Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate prediction challenging. Recent approaches have focused on developing data-driven models that attempt to preserve invariant statistics over long horizons since many chaotic systems exhibit dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Despite the recent progress in such models, they are still often prone to generating unbounded trajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce a modular framework that provides formal guarantees of trajectory boundedness for neural network chaotic dynamics models. Our core contribution is a dissipative projection layer that leverages control-theoretic principles to ensure the learned system is dissipative. Specifically, our framework simultaneously learns a dynamics emulator and an energy-like function, where the latter is used to construct an algebraic dissipative constraint within the projection layer. Furthermore, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the system's strange attractor, which is known to be difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We demonstrate our model's ability to produce bounded long-horizon forecasts that preserve invariant statistics for chaotic dynamical systems, including Lorenz 96 and a reduced-order model of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</p>

            <p>The generation of medical images presents significant challenges due to their high-resolution and three-dimensional nature. Existing methods often yield suboptimal performance in generating high-quality 3D medical images, and there is currently no universal generative framework for medical imaging. In this paper, we introduce a 3D Medical Latent Diffusion (3D MedDiffusion) model for controllable, high-quality 3D medical image generation. 3D MedDiffusion incorporates a novel, highly efficient Patch-Volume Autoencoder that compresses medical images into latent space through patch-wise encoding and recovers back into image space through volume-wise decoding. Additionally, we design a new noise estimator to capture both local details and global structural information during diffusion denoising process. 3D MedDiffusion can generate fine-detailed, high-resolution images (up to 512x512x512) and effectively adapt to various downstream tasks as it is trained on large-scale datasets covering CT and MRI modalities and different anatomical regions (from head to leg). Experimental results demonstrate that 3D MedDiffusion surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generative quality and exhibits strong generalizability across tasks such as sparse-view CT reconstruction, fast MRI reconstruction, and data augmentation for segmentation and classification.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaihong Lu, Huanshui Zhang, Long Wang</p>
            <p>In this paper, the problem of distributively seeking the equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of a virtual leader's objective function in the inner level, which depends on the actions of the players in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function of the virtual leader is formed by the sum of some local functions with two arguments, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument. When making decisions, each player in the outer level only has access to a local part of the virtual leader's objective function. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the leader are involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions while cooperatively minimizing the objective function of the virtual leader to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium point. Then, for the case where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the virtual leader are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of players' cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions to the Nash equilibrium point are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in bidirectional EV charging and discharging systems have spurred interest in workplace applications. However, real-world deployments face various dynamic factors, such as fluctuating electricity prices and uncertain EV departure times, that hinder effective energy management. To address these issues and minimize building electricity costs while meeting EV charging requirements, we design a hierarchical multi-agent structure in which a high-level agent coordinates overall charge or discharge decisions based on real-time pricing, while multiple low-level agents manage individual power level accordingly. For uncertain EV departure times, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware critic augmentation mechanism for low-level agents that improves the evaluation of power-level decisions and ensures robust control under such uncertainty. Building upon these two key designs, we introduce HUCA, a real-time charging control framework that coordinates energy supply among the building and EVs. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets show that HUCA significantly reduces electricity costs and maintains competitive performance in meeting EV charging requirements under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios. The results further highlight the importance of hierarchical control and the proposed critic augmentation under the uncertain departure scenario. A case study illustrates HUCA's capability to allocate energy between the building and EVs in real time, underscoring its potential for practical use.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James M. Cozens, Simon J. Godsill</p>
            <p>We introduce a new method for estimating the Ideal Time-Frequency Representation (ITFR) of complex nonstationary signals. The Reconstructive Ideal Fractional Transform (RIFT) computes a constellation of Continuous Fractional Wavelet Transforms (CFWTs) aligned to different local time-frequency curvatures. This constellation is combined into a single optimised time-frequency energy representation via a localised entropy-based sparsity measure, designed to resolve auto-terms and attenuate cross-terms. Finally, a positivity-constrained Lucy-Richardson deconvolution with total-variation regularisation is applied to estimate the ITFR, achieving auto-term resolution comparable to that of the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD), yielding the high-resolution RIFT representation. The required Cohen's class convolutional kernels are fully derived in the paper for the chosen CFWT constellations. Additionally, the optimisation yields an Instantaneous Phase Direction (IPD) field, which allows the localised curvature in speech or music extracts to be visualised and utilised within a Kalman tracking scheme, enabling the extraction of signal component trajectories and the construction of the Spline-RIFT variant. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world signals demonstrates the algorithm's ability to effectively suppress cross-terms and achieve superior time-frequency precision relative to competing methods. This advance holds significant potential for a wide range of applications requiring high-resolution cross-term-free time-frequency analysis.</p>

            <p>The U-Net architecture and its variants have remained state-of-the-art (SOTA) for retinal vessel segmentation over the past decade. In this study, we introduce a Full-Scale Guided Network (FSG-Net), where a novel feature representation module using modernized convolution blocks effectively captures full-scale structural information, while a guided convolution block subsequently refines this information. Specifically, we introduce an attention-guided filter within the guided convolution block, leveraging its similarity to unsharp masking to enhance fine vascular structures. Passing full-scale information to the attention block facilitates the generation of more contextually relevant attention maps, which are then passed to the attention-guided filter, providing further refinement to the segmentation performance. The structure preceding the guided convolution block can be replaced by any U-Net variant, ensuring flexibility and scalability across various segmentation tasks. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented recent studies available in public repositories to evaluate their scalability and reproducibility. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its compact architecture, FSG-Net delivers performance competitive with SOTA methods across multiple public datasets. Ablation studies further demonstrate that each proposed component meaningfully contributes to this competitive performance. Our code is available on this https URL.</p>

            <h2>Safeguarding Privacy in Edge Speech Understanding with Tiny Foundation Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Afsara Benazir, Felix Xiaozhu Lin</p>
            <p>Robust speech recognition systems rely on cloud service providers for inference. It needs to ensure that an untrustworthy provider cannot deduce the sensitive content in speech. Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping in mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the under utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the first time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on resource-constrained devices. We introduce SpeechShield, an edge/cloud privacy preserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without compromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device masking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter sensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the input and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud service or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of SpeechShield hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a confidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud and on-device model. We implement SpeechShield on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments show that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking privacy. SpeechShield with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech transcription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities directly on-device. SpeechShield is 16x smaller in memory, 3.3x faster and 17x more compute efficient than prior privacy preserving speech frameworks and has a relative reduction in word error rate (WER) by 38.8-77.5% when compared to existing offline transcription services.</p>

            <p>Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow.

In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by introducing an explainability tool for spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, this tools retrieves the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compares it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We apply our tool on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. The tool reveals that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cecilia Diana-Albelda, Roberto Alcover-Couso, Álvaro García-Martín, Jesus Bescos, Marcos Escudero-Viñolo</p>
            <p>Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that require accurate imaging-based diagnosis, with segmentation playing a critical role in evaluating morphology and treatment decisions. Manual delineation of gliomas is time-consuming and prone to variability, motivating the use of deep learning to improve consistency and alleviate clinical workload. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the information available in multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), particularly inter-slice contextual features, and typically require considerable computational resources while lacking robustness across tumor type variations. We present GBT-SAM, a parameter-efficient deep learning framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a large-scale vision model, to volumetric mp-MRI data. GBT-SAM reduces input complexity by selecting fewer than 2.6\% of slices per scan while incorporating all four MRI modalities, preserving essential tumor-related information with minimal cost. Furthermore, our model is trained by a two-step fine-tuning strategy that incorporates a depth-aware module to capture inter-slice correlations and lightweight adaptation layers, resulting in just 6.5M trainable parameters, which is the lowest among SAM-based approaches. GBT-SAM achieves a Dice Score of 93.54 on the BraTS Adult Glioma dataset and demonstrates robust performance on Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. These results highlight GBT-SAM's potential as a computationally efficient and domain-robust framework for brain tumor segmentation using mp-MRI.

            <p>A novel set-theoretical approach to hands-off control is proposed, focusing on spatial arguments for command limitation rather than temporal ones. By employing dynamical feedback alongside invariant set-based constraints, actuation is employed only to drive the system's state within a "hands-off region" of its state-space, where the plant can freely evolve in open-loop configuration. A computationally-efficient procedure with strong theoretical guarantees is devised, and its effectiveness is showcased via an intuitive practical example.</p>

            <h2>L2RU: a Structured State Space Model with prescribed L2-bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Massai, Muhammad Zakwan, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate</p>
            <p>Structured state-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful architecture at the intersection of machine learning and control, featuring layers composed of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems followed by pointwise nonlinearities. These models combine the expressiveness of deep neural networks with the interpretability and inductive bias of dynamical systems, offering strong performance on long-sequence tasks with favorable computational complexity. However, their adoption in applications such as system identification and optimal control remains limited by the difficulty of enforcing stability and robustness in a principled and tractable manner. We introduce L2RU, a class of SSMs endowed with a prescribed $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain bound, guaranteeing input--output stability and robustness for all parameter values. The L2RU architecture is derived from free parametrizations of LTI systems satisfying an $\mathcal{L}_2$ constraint, enabling unconstrained optimization via standard gradient-based methods while preserving rigorous stability guarantees. Specifically, we develop two complementary parametrizations: a non-conservative formulation that provides a complete characterization of square LTI systems with a given $\mathcal{L}_2$-bound, and a conservative formulation that extends the approach to general (possibly non-square) systems while improving computational efficiency through a structured representation of the system matrices. Both parametrizations admit efficient initialization schemes that facilitate training long-memory models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a nonlinear system identification benchmark, where L2RU achieves improved performance and training stability compared to existing SSM architectures, highlighting its potential as a principled and robust building block for learning and control.</p>

            <h2>Curvature-Constrained Vector Field for Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Robots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yike Qiao, Xiaodong He, An Zhuo, Zhiyong Sun, Weimin Bao, Zhongkui Li</p>
            <p>Vector fields are advantageous in handling nonholonomic motion planning as they provide reference orientation for robots. However, additionally incorporating curvature constraints becomes challenging, due to the interconnection between the design of the curvature-bounded vector field and the tracking controller under underactuation. In this paper, we present a novel framework to co-develop the vector field and the control laws, guiding the nonholonomic robot to the target configuration with curvature-bounded trajectory. First, we formulate the problem by introducing the target positive limit set, which allows the robot to converge to or pass through the target configuration, depending on different dynamics and tasks. Next, we construct a curvature-constrained vector field (CVF) via blending and distributing basic flow fields in workspace and propose the saturated control laws with a dynamic gain, under which the tracking error's magnitude decreases even when saturation occurs. Under the control laws, kinematically constrained nonholonomic robots are guaranteed to track the reference CVF and converge to the target positive limit set with bounded trajectory curvature. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CVF method outperforms other vector-field-based algorithms. Experiments on Ackermann UGVs and semi-physical fixed-wing UAVs demonstrate that the method can be effectively implemented in real-world scenarios.</p>

            <h2>A Cyber Insurance Policy for Hedging Against Load-Altering Attacks and Extreme Load Variations in Distribution Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shijie Pan, Zaint A. Alexakis, S Subhash Lakshminarayana, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE 118-bus test system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeder model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.</p>

            <p>Deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, but prior work has largely targeted conditions where diagnosis is relatively straightforward. More challenging problems remain underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. These lesions are difficult to diagnose due to subtle imaging features, often necessitating invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). We introduce ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and present a deep learning framework for Bankart lesion detection on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI contains shoulder MRIs from patients who underwent arthroscopy, providing ground-truth labels from intraoperative findings, the diagnostic gold standard. Separate models were trained for MRIs and MRAs using CNN- and transformer-based architectures, with predictions ensembled across multiple imaging planes. Our models achieved radiologist-level performance, with accuracy on standard MRIs surpassing radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation on independent hospital data demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluation, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and foster development of datasets and models that address clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.</p>

            <p>Physics sensing plays a central role in many scientific and engineering domains, which inherently involves two coupled tasks: reconstructing dense physical fields from sparse observations and optimizing scattered sensor placements to observe maximum information. While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

            <h2>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> TaeJun Ha, Chaehyun Jung, Hyeonuk Kim, Jeongwoo Park, Jeonghun Park</p>
            <p>In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high inference complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance-complexity trade-off, providing a powerful yet highly efficient solution for practical channel estimation</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jason M. Merlo, Samuel Wagner, John Lancaster, Jeffrey A. Nanzer</p>
            <p>This work presents a fully-digital high-accuracy real-time calibration procedure for frequency and time alignment of open-loop wirelessly coordinated coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) modems, enabling radio frequency (RF) phase coherence of spatially separated commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radios (SDRs) without cables or external references such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Building on previous work using high-accuracy spectrally-sparse time of arrival (ToA) waveforms and a multi-step ToA refinement process, a high-accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT)-based timefrequency coordination approach is demonstrated. Due to the two-way nature of the high-accuracy TWTT approach, the time and frequency estimates are Doppler and multi-path tolerant, so long as the channel is reciprocal over the synchronization epoch. This technique is experimentally verified using COTS SDRs in a lab environment in static and dynamic scenarios and with significant multipath scatterers. Time, frequency, and phase stability were evaluated by beamforming over coaxial cables to an oscilloscope which achieved time and phase precisions of ~60 ps-70 ps, with median coherent gains above 99 % using optimized coordination parameters, and a beamforming frequency root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.73 ppb in a dynamic scenario. Finally, experiments were conducted to compare the performance of this technique with previous works using an analog continuous-wave two-tone (CWTT) frequency reference technique in both static and dynamic settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Tiranti, Francesco Wanderlingh, Enrico Simetti, Marco Baglietto, Giovanni Indiveri, Antonio Pascoal</p>
            <p>Accurate tracking of underwater acoustic sources is critical for a variety of marine applications, yet remains a challenging task due to communication constraints and environmental uncertainties. In this regard, this paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking using a team of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The core idea is to optimize the guidance of each agent to achieve coordinated motion planning that leads to optimal geometric configurations with respect to the target, thereby enhancing tracking performance. To tackle this, we propose a Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) framework to improve performance and robustness. The control problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization task, incorporating geometric observability, proximity to the target, and communication connectivity. A Receding Horizon Control (RHC) approach, coupled with an Unscented Transform (UT)-based prediction scheme, is employed to ensure longterm tracking accuracy while accounting for uncertainties. The optimization is distributed using the sequential multi-agent decision-making framework, combined with the Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) communication protocol. The proposed methodology is implemented in a simulation environment that accounts for the constraints of acoustic communication. The approach is compared with existing methods such as decentralized MPC and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).</p>

            <h2>Zero-shot Denoising via Neural Compression: Theoretical and algorithmic framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Zafari, Xi Chen, Shirin Jalali</p>
            <p>Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Favaro, Jean-François Toubeau, François Vallée, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) is a major electricity end-use with a substantial potential for providing grid services, such as demand response. Harnessing this flexibility requires accurate modeling of the thermal dynamics of buildings, a difficult task because nonlinear heat transfer and recurring daily cycles make historical data highly correlated and insufficient to generalize to new weather, occupancy, and control scenarios. This paper presents an HVAC management system formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP), where Neural Network (NN) models of thermal dynamics are embedded as exact mixed-integer linear constraints. Unlike traditional training approaches that minimize prediction errors, we employ Decision-Focused Learning (DFL) to learn the NN parameters with the objective of directly improving the HVAC cost performance. However, the discrete nature of MIQP hinders DFL, as it leads to undefined and discontinuous gradients, thus impeding standard gradient-based training. We leverage Stochastic Smoothing (SS) to enable efficient gradient computation without the need to differentiate the MIQP. Experiments on a realistic five-zone building using a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that the proposed SS-DFL approach outperforms conventional identify-then-optimize (i.e., the thermal dynamics model is identified on historical data then used in optimization) and relaxed DFL methods in both cost savings and grid service performance, highlighting its potential for scalable, grid-aware building control.</p>

HRTFs are unique to everyone, due to personal morphology, shaping how sound waves interact with the body before reaching the eardrums. Here we present the extended SONICOM HRTF dataset which expands on the previous version released in 2023. The total number of measured subjects has now been increased to 300, with demographic information for a subset of the participants, providing context for the dataset's population and relevance. The dataset incorporates synthesised HRTFs for 200 of the 300 subjects, generated using Mesh2HRTF, alongside pre-processed 3D scans of the head and ears, optimised for HRTF synthesis. This rich dataset facilitates rapid and iterative optimisation of HRTF synthesis algorithms, allowing the automatic generation of large data. The optimised scans enable seamless morphological modifications, providing insights into how anatomical changes impact HRTFs, and the larger sample size enhances the effectiveness of machine learning approaches. To support analysis, we also introduce the Spatial Audio Metrics (SAM) Toolbox, a Python package designed for efficient analysis and visualisation of HRTF data, offering customisable tools for advanced research. Together, the extended dataset and toolbox offer a comprehensive resource for advancing personalised spatial audio research and development.</p>

            <p>Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training loss via prediction-powered inference.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei Liu, Luping Ji, Jiaxiang Gou, Xiangxiang Zeng</p>
            <p>Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

            <p>Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from prompt sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces two novel algorithms designed to address the challenge of super-resolution sensing parameter estimation in bistatic configurations within communication-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our approach leverages the estimated channel state information derived from reference symbols originally intended for communication to achieve super-resolution sensing parameter estimation. The first algorithm, IFFT-C2VNN, employs complex-valued convolutional neural networks to estimate the parameters of different targets, achieving significant reductions in computational complexity compared to traditional methods. The second algorithm, PARAMING, utilizes a parametric method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the system model, including the transmit and receive array geometries, to extract the sensing parameters accurately. Through a comprehensive performance analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of both algorithms across a range of signal-to-noise ratios, underscoring their applicability in realistic ISAC scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Fluid-Antenna-aided AAV Secure Communications in Eavesdropper Uncertain Location</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingjie Wu, Junshan Luo, Weiyu Chen, Shilian Wang, Fanggang Wang, Haiyang Ding</p>
            <p>For autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) secure communications, traditional designs based on fixed position antenna (FPA) lack sufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoF), which leaves the line-of-sight-dominated AAV links vulnerable to eavesdropping. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a framework that effectively incorporates the fluid antenna (FA) and the artificial noise (AN) techniques. Specifically, the minimum secrecy rate (MSR) among multiple eavesdroppers is maximized by jointly optimizing AAV deployment, signal and AN precoders, and FA positions. In particular, the worst-case MSR is considered by taking the channel uncertainties due to the uncertainty about eavesdropping locations into account. To tackle the highly coupled optimization variables and the channel uncertainties in the formulated problem, an efficient and robust algorithm is proposed. Particularly, the uncertain regions of eavesdroppers, whose shapes can be arbitrary, are disposed by constructing convex hull. In addition, two movement modes of FAs are considered, namely, free movement mode and zonal movement mode, for which different optimization techniques are applied, respectively. Numerical results show that, the proposed FA schemes boost security by exploiting additional spatial DoF rather than transmit power, while AN provides remarkable gains under high transmit power. Furthermore, the synergy between FA and AN results in a secure advantage that exceeds the sum of their individual contributions, achieving a balance between security and reliability under limited resources.</p>

We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling.</p>

            <h2>NEFT: A Unified Transformer Framework for Efficient Near-Field CSI Feedback in XL-MIMO Systems</h2>

            <p>Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, operating in the near-field region due to their massive antenna arrays, are key enablers of next-generation wireless communications but face significant challenges in channel state information (CSI) feedback. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool by learning compact channel features for feedback. However, existing methods struggle to capture the intricate structure of near-field CSI and incur prohibitive computational overhead on practical mobile devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose the near-field efficient feedback Transformer (NEFT) family for accurate near-field CSI feedback with reduced overhead under diverse hardware constraints. NEFT builds on a hierarchical vision Transformer backbone with progressive token reduction and multi-scale feature extraction, enabling compact and effective modeling of near-field channel characteristics. Furthermore, NEFT is extended with lightweight variants: NEFT-Compact applies multi-level knowledge distillation (KD) to reduce model complexity while preserving accuracy; NEFT-Hybrid adopts an attention-free CNN encoder to reduce encoder-side computation; and NEFT-Edge combines NEFT-Hybrid with KD to enable deployment on highly resource-constrained edge devices. Extensive simulations show that NEFT achieves a 15--21dB improvement in normalized mean-squared error over state-of-the-art methods, NEFT-Compact and NEFT-Edge reduce total FLOPs by 25-36% with negligible accuracy loss, while NEFT-Hybrid reduces encoder-side complexity by up to 64%, enabling deployment in highly asymmetric device scenarios. These results establish NEFT as a practical and scalable solution for near-field CSI feedback in XL-MIMO systems.</p>

            <h2>Semantic-VAE: Semantic-Alignment Latent Representation for Better Speech Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhikang Niu, Shujie Hu, Jeongsoo Choi, Yushen Chen, Peining Chen, Pengcheng Zhu, Yunting Yang, Bowen Zhang, Jian Zhao, Chunhui Wang, Xie Chen</p>
            <p>While mel-spectrograms have been widely utilized as intermediate representations in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), their inherent redundancy leads to inefficiency in learning text-speech alignment. Compact VAE-based latent representations have recently emerged as a stronger alternative, but they also face a fundamental optimization dilemma: higher-dimensional latent spaces improve reconstruction quality and speaker similarity, but degrade intelligibility, while lower-dimensional spaces improve intelligibility at the expense of reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we propose Semantic-VAE, a novel VAE framework that utilizes semantic alignment regularization in the latent space. This design alleviates the reconstruction-generation trade-off by capturing semantic structure in high-dimensional latent representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-VAE significantly improves synthesis quality and training efficiency. When integrated into F5-TTS, our method achieves 2.10% WER and 0.64 speaker similarity on LibriSpeech-PC, outperforming mel-based systems (2.23%, 0.60) and vanilla acoustic VAE baselines (2.65%, 0.59). We also release the code and models to facilitate further research.</p>

            <h2>Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized Linear-Quadratic Control with Multiplicative Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Diaz, Lucky Li, Wenhao Zhang</p>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems with multiplicative noise over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the regularized policy gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and almost-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-based regularized policy gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.</p>

            <h2>MeanVC: Lightweight and Streaming Zero-Shot Voice Conversion via Mean Flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guobin Ma, Jixun Yao, Ziqian Ning, Yuepeng Jiang, Lingxin Xiong, Lei Xie, Pengcheng Zhu</p>
            <p>Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer timbre from a source speaker to any unseen target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Growing application scenarios demand models with streaming inference capabilities. This has created a pressing need for models that are simultaneously fast, lightweight, and high-fidelity. However, existing streaming methods typically rely on either autoregressive (AR) or non-autoregressive (NAR) frameworks, which either require large parameter sizes to achieve strong performance or struggle to generalize to unseen speakers. In this study, we propose MeanVC, a lightweight and streaming zero-shot VC approach. MeanVC introduces a diffusion transformer with a chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy, combining the strengths of both AR and NAR paradigms for efficient streaming processing. By introducing mean flows, MeanVC regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling zero-shot VC with superior speech quality and speaker similarity in a single sampling step by directly mapping from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. Additionally, we incorporate diffusion adversarial post-training to mitigate over-smoothing and further enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanVC significantly outperforms existing zero-shot streaming VC systems, achieving superior conversion quality with higher efficiency and significantly fewer parameters.

            <p>The sharp rise in medical tomography examinations has created a demand for automated systems that can reliably extract informative features for downstream tasks such as tumor characterization. Although 3D volumes contain richer information than individual slices, effective 3D classification remains difficult: volumetric data encode complex spatial dependencies, and the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets has constrained progress toward 3D foundation models. As a result, many recent approaches rely on 2D vision foundation models trained on natural images, repurposing them as feature extractors for medical scans with surprisingly strong performance. Despite their practical success, current methods that apply 2D foundation models to 3D scans via slice-based decomposition remain fundamentally limited. Standard slicing along axial, sagittal, and coronal planes often fails to capture the true spatial extent of a structure when its orientation does not align with these canonical views. More critically, most approaches aggregate slice features independently, ignoring the underlying 3D geometry and losing spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. Instead of restricting the model to axial, sagittal, or coronal planes, our method samples both canonical and non-canonical cross-sections generated from uniformly distributed points on a sphere enclosing the volume. We publicly share our accessible code base at this http URL and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at this https URL.</p>

            <p>High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address.

            <p>The consideration of stochastic uncertainty in optimal and predictive control is a well-explored topic.

Hence, this paper introduces the toolbox \texttt{this http URL} which enables to efficiently solve stochastic OCPs for a large class of disturbance distributions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youzhe Yang, Hafiz Majid Hussain, Juha Haakana, Pedro Nardelli</p>
            <p>A vital strategy for ports to mitigate the environmental impact of the maritime industry, while complying with frameworks such as the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), entails the systematic implementation of comprehensive energy management solutions. This paper provides a baseline evaluation of the energy management systems (EMSs) implementation and their impact on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and operational costs in smart ports. Initially, we provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on case studies from prominent ports, including Hamburg, Genoa, Jurong, and Shanghai Yangshan Phase IV. The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%. The study also identifies critical challenges, including system integration, data quality issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for standardization. These findings provide valuable insights for port authorities and policymakers, supporting the transition toward more sustainable and efficient port operations.</p>

            <h2>An Exact, Finite Dimensional Representation for Full-Block, Circle Criterion Multipliers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Biertümpfel, Bin Hu, Geir Dullerud, Peter Seiler</p>
            <p>This paper provides the first finite-dimensional characterization for the complete set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. We consider the interconnection of a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system in feedback with a non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearity. Sufficient conditions for stability and performance can be derived using: (i) dissipation inequalities, and (ii) Quadratic Constraints (QCs) that bound the input/output pairs of the nonlinearity. Larger classes of QCs (or multipliers) reduce the conservatism of the conditions. Full-block, circle criterion multipliers define the complete set of all possible QCs for non-repeated, sector-bounded nonlinearities. These provide the least conservative conditions. However, full-block multipliers are defined by an uncountably infinite number of constraints and hence do not lead to computationally tractable solutions if left in this raw form. This paper provides a new finite-dimensional characterization for the set of full-block, circle criterion multipliers. The key theoretical insight is: the set of all input/output pairs of non-repeated sector-bounded nonlinearities is equal to the set of all incremental pairs for an appropriately constructed piecewise linear function. Our new description for the complete set of multipliers only requires a finite number of matrix copositivity constraints. These conditions have an exact, computationally tractable implementation for problems where the nonlinearity has small input/output dimensions $(\le 4)$. We illustrate the use of our new characterization via a simple example.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artyom Tsanda, Sarah Reiss, Konrad Scheffler, Marija Boberg, Tobias Knopp</p>
            <p>Magnetic particle imaging reconstructs tracer distributions using a system matrix obtained through time-consuming, noise-prone calibration measurements. Methods for addressing imperfections in measured system matrices increasingly rely on deep neural networks, yet curated training data remain scarce. This study evaluates whether physics-based simulated system matrices can be used to train deep learning models for different system matrix restoration tasks, i.e., denoising, accelerated calibration, upsampling, and inpainting, that generalize to measured data. A large system matrices dataset was generated using an equilibrium magnetization model extended with uniaxial anisotropy. The dataset spans particle, scanner, and calibration parameters for 2D and 3D trajectories, and includes background noise injected from empty-frame measurements. For each restoration task, deep learning models were compared with classical non-learning baseline methods. The models trained solely on simulated system matrices generalized to measured data across all tasks: for denoising, DnCNN/RDN/SwinIR outperformed DCT-F baseline by >10 dB PSNR and up to 0.1 SSIM on simulations and led to perceptually better reconstuctions of real data; for 2D upsampling, SMRnet exceeded bicubic by 20 dB PSNR and 0.08 SSIM at $\times 2$-$\times 4$ which did not transfer qualitatively to real measurements. For 3D accelerated calibration, SMRnet matched tricubic in noiseless cases and was more robust under noise, and for 3D inpainting, biharmonic inpainting was superior when noise-free but degraded with noise, while a PConvUNet maintained quality and yielded less blurry reconstructions. The demonstrated transferability of deep learning models trained on simulations to real measurements mitigates the data-scarcity problem and enables the development of new methods beyond current measurement capabilities.</p>

            <p>The building sector is one of the largest contributors to global energy consumption. Improving its energy efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy management systems (EMS) play a key role in monitoring and controlling building appliances efficiently and reliably. With the increasing integration of renewable energy, intelligent EMS solutions have received growing attention. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been explored for this purpose and shows strong potential. However, most RL-based EMS methods require a large number of training steps to learn effective control policies, especially when adapting to unseen buildings, which limits their practical deployment. This paper introduces MetaEMS, a meta-reinforcement learning framework for EMS. MetaEMS improves learning efficiency by transferring knowledge from previously solved tasks to new ones through group-level and building-level adaptation, enabling fast adaptation and effective control across diverse building environments. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaEMS adapts more rapidly to unseen buildings and consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Scheduling and Aggregation Design for Asynchronous Federated Learning over Wireless Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chung-Hsuan Hu, Zheng Chen, Erik G. Larsson</p>
            <p>Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning (ML) framework that combines on-device training and server-based aggregation to train a common ML model among distributed agents. In this work, we propose an asynchronous FL design with periodic aggregation to tackle the straggler issue in FL systems. Considering limited wireless communication resources, we investigate the effect of different scheduling policies and aggregation designs on the convergence performance. Driven by the importance of reducing the bias and variance of the aggregated model updates, we propose a scheduling policy that jointly considers the channel quality and training data representation of user devices. The effectiveness of our channel-aware data-importance-based scheduling policy, compared with state-of-the-art methods proposed for synchronous FL, is validated through simulations. Moreover, we show that an ``age-aware'' aggregation weighting design can significantly improve the learning performance in an asynchronous FL setting.</p>

            <p>Whisper is a multitask and multilingual speech model covering 99 languages. It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.</p>

            <p>We propose an SDP-based framework to address the stabilization of input delay systems while taking into account dissipative constraints. A key to our approach is the introduction of the concept of parameterized linear dynamical state feedbacks (LDSFs), which draws inspiration from recent advancements in the analyses of distributed delays. The parameterized LDSFs generalize conventional predictor controllers, where the interpretation of state prediction is concealed and their degree of parameterization can be increased by adjusting the integral kernels. A sufficient condition for the existence of dissipative LDSFs is formulated as matrix inequalities by constructing a complete type Krasovski\uı functional. To solve the bilinear matrix inequality in the synthesis condition, we employ an off-line inner convex approximation algorithm that can be initialized using the gains of predictor controllers obtained via explicit construction. So the unknowns of our LTDS can be computed by solving convex semidefinite programs. Numerical examples and simulations were experimented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology.</p>

            <p>Electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that records electrical activity from the scalp using electrodes, plays a vital role in affective computing. However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p>

            <p>Construction of a general-purpose post-recognition error corrector poses a crucial question: how can we most effectively train a model on a large mixture of domain datasets? The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark.

            <p>Blood pressure (BP) measurement is crucial for daily health assessment. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which extracts pulse waves from face videos captured by a camera, has the potential to enable convenient BP measurement without specialized medical devices. However, there are various uncertainties in BP estimation using rPPG, leading to limited estimation performance and reliability. In this paper, we propose U-FaceBP, an uncertainty-aware Bayesian ensemble deep learning method for face video-based BP measurement. U-FaceBP models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in face video-based BP estimation with a Bayesian neural network (BNN). Additionally, we design U-FaceBP as an ensemble method, estimating BP from rPPG signals, PPG signals derived from face videos, and face images using multiple BNNs. Large-scale experiments on two datasets involving 1197 subjects from diverse racial groups demonstrate that U-FaceBP outperforms state-of-the-art BP estimation methods. Furthermore, we show that the uncertainty estimates provided by U-FaceBP are informative and useful for guiding modality fusion, assessing prediction reliability, and analyzing performance across racial groups.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising technology for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its diagonal scattering matrix. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on integrating a hybrid transmitting and reflecting BD-RIS into CF mMIMO systems to enhance coverage and spatial multiplexing. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, we propose a Riemannian limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (R-L-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves faster convergence and finds higher-quality solutions compared with baselines, while also demonstrating a favorable performance-complexity trade-off.</p>

            <p>The growing scale of power systems and the increasing uncertainty introduced by renewable energy sources necessitates novel optimization techniques that are significantly faster and more accurate than existing methods. The AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem, a core component of power grid optimization, is often approximated using linearized DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) models for computational tractability, albeit at the cost of suboptimal and inefficient decisions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for network equivalency that enhances DC-OPF to more closely mimic the behavior of AC-OPF. The approach utilizes recent advances in differentiable optimization, incorporating a neural network trained to predict adjusted nodal shunt conductances and branch susceptances in order to account for nonlinear power flow behavior. The model can be trained end-to-end using modern deep learning frameworks by leveraging the implicit function theorem. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve prediction accuracy.</p>

SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS.

            <h2>Homeostatic Ubiquity of Hebbian Dynamics in Regularized Learning Rules</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Koplow, Tomaso Poggio, Liu Ziyin</p>
            <p>Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity are widely observed in the biological brain, yet their theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we find that when a learning method is regularized with L2 weight decay, its learning signal will gradually align with the direction of the Hebbian learning signal as it approaches stationarity. This Hebbian-like behavior is not unique to SGD: almost any learning rule, including random ones, can exhibit the same signature long before learning has ceased. We also provide a theoretical explanation for anti-Hebbian plasticity in regression tasks, demonstrating how it can arise naturally from gradient or input noise, and offering a potential reason for the observed anti-Hebbian effects in the brain. Certainly, our proposed mechanisms do not rule out any conventionally established forms of Hebbian plasticity and could coexist with them extensively in the brain. A key insight for neurophysiology is the need to develop ways to experimentally distinguish these two types of Hebbian observations.</p>

            <h2>Multigranular Evaluation for Brain Visual Decoding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weihao Xia, Cengiz Oztireli</p>
            <p>Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground-truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for evaluating brain visual decoding methods.</p>

            <p>We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training. Our code and data will be open source to encourage future studies.</p>

            <p>Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps. This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness. Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability, demonstrates improved adaptability across multiple robotic hands, helping to alleviate annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping.

            <h2>Towards Fully Onboard State Estimation and Trajectory Tracking for UAVs with Suspended Payloads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Jiroušek, Tomáš Báča, Martin Saska</p>
            <p>This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle hardware.</p>

            <h2>Distance Between Stochastic Linear Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Venkatraman Renganathan, Sei Zhen Khong</p>
            <p>While the existing stochastic control theory is well equipped to handle dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties, a paradigm shift using distance measure based decision making is required for the effective further exploration of the field. As a first step, a distance measure between two stochastic linear time invariant systems is proposed here, extending the existing distance metrics between deterministic linear dynamical systems. In the frequency domain, the proposed distance measure corresponds to the worst-case point-wise in frequency Wasserstein distance between distributions characterising the uncertainties using inverse stereographic projection on the Riemann sphere. For the time domain setting, the proposed distance corresponds to the gap metric induced type-q Wasserstein distance between the distributions characterising the uncertainty of plant models. Apart from providing lower and upper bounds for the proposed distance measures in both frequency and time domain settings, it is proved that the former never exceeds the latter. The proposed distance measures will facilitate the provision of probabilistic guarantees on system robustness and controller performances.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Defeng He, Weiliang Xiong, Shiqiang He, Haiping Du</p>
            <p>This note presents a novel, efficient economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme for non-dissipative systems subject to state and input constraints. A new conception of convergence filters is defined to address the stability issue of EMPC for constrained non-dissipative systems. Three convergence filters are designed accordingly to be imposed into the receding horizon optimization problem of EMPC. To improve online computational efficiency, the variable horizon idea without explicit terminal state constraints is adopted to compromise the convergence speed, economic performance, and computational burden of EMPC. Moreover, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the recursive feasibility and stability of the EMPC. The advantages of the proposed EMPC are validated by a classical non-dissipative continuous stirred-tank reactor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Zuliani, Efe C. Balta, John Lygeros</p>
            <p>Nonlinear optimization-based control policies, such as those those arising in nonlinear Model Predictive Control, have seen remarkable success in recent years. These policies require solving computationally demanding nonlinear optimization programs online at each time-step. The resulting solution map, viewed as a function of the measured state of the system and design parameters, may not be differentiable, which poses significant challenges if the control policy is embedded in a gradient-based policy optimization scheme. We propose a principled way to regularize the nonlinear optimization problem, obtaining a surrogate derivative even if when the original problem is not differentiable. The surrogate problem is differentiable by design and its solution map coincides with the solution of the unregularized problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a free-final-time optimal control problem and a receding-horizon nonlinear MPC example.</p>

            <p>Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.</p>

            <h2>Hyperparameters are all you need: Using five-step inference for an original diffusion model to generate images comparable to the latest distillation model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zilai Li</p>
            <p>The diffusion model is a state-of-the-art generative model that samples images by applying a neural network iteratively. However, the original sampling algorithm requires substantial computation cost, and reducing the sampling step is a prevailing research area. To cope with this problem, one mainstream approach is to treat the sampling process as an algorithm that solves an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Our study proposes a training-free inference plugin compatible with most few-step ODE solvers. To the best of my knowledge, our algorithm is the first training-free algorithm to sample a 1024 x 1024-resolution image in 6 steps and a 512 x 512-resolution image in 5 steps, with an FID result that outperforms the SOTA distillation models and the 20-step DPM++ 2m solver, respectively. Based on analyses of the latent diffusion model's structure, the diffusion ODE, and the Free-U mechanism, we explain why specific hyperparameter couplings improve stability and inference speed without retraining. Meanwhile, experimental results also reveal a new design space of the latent diffusion ODE solver. Additionally, we also analyze the difference between the original diffusion model and the diffusion distillation model via an information-theoretic study, which shows the reason why the few-step ODE solver designed for the diffusion model can outperform the training-based diffusion distillation algorithm in few-step inference. The tentative results of the experiment prove the mathematical analysis. code base is below: this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fanfan Lin, Peter Wilson, Xinze Li, Alan Mantooth</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and the preparation of an AI-ready engineering workforce. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards, talent development initiatives, and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also oriented toward human and societal benefit.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Legged Locomotion via Online Learning for Model Predictive Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Zhou, Xiaoyu Zhang, Vasileios Tzoumas</p>
            <p>We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations, where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$, where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation. The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.</p>

            <p>In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.</p>

            <p>Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning. However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems. Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency. Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddeshwar Raghavan, Jiangpeng He, Fengqing Zhu</p>
            <p>Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Joshua Meesala</p>
            <p>Modern deep learning systems are typically deployed as open-loop function approximators: they map inputs to outputs in a single pass, without regulating how much computation or explanatory effort is spent on a given case. In safety-critical settings, this is brittle: easy and ambiguous inputs receive identical processing, and uncertainty is only read off retrospectively from raw probabilities. We introduce the Surgical Cognitive Interpreter (SCI), a lightweight closed-loop metacognitive control layer that wraps an existing stochastic model and turns prediction into an iterative process. SCI monitors a scalar interpretive state SP(t), here instantiated as a normalized entropy-based confidence signal, and adaptively decides whether to stop, continue sampling, or abstain. The goal is not to improve accuracy per se, but to regulate interpretive error {\Delta}SP and expose a safety signal that tracks when the underlying model is likely to fail. We instantiate SCI around Monte Carlo dropout classifiers in three domains: vision (MNIST digits), medical time series (MIT-BIH arrhythmia), and industrial condition monitoring (rolling-element bearings). In all cases, the controller allocates more inference steps to misclassified inputs than to correct ones (up to about 3-4x on MNIST and bearings, and 1.4x on MIT-BIH). The resulting {\Delta}SP acts as a usable safety signal for detecting misclassifications (AUROC 0.63 on MNIST, 0.70 on MIT-BIH, 0.86 on bearings). Code and reproducibility: this https URL</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nuno Soares, António Grilo</p>
            <p>The resource-constrained shortest path problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental NP-hard optimization challenge with broad applications, from network routing to autonomous navigation. This problem involves finding a path that minimizes a primary cost subject to a budget on a secondary resource. While various RCSPP solvers exist, they often face critical scalability limitations when applied to the large, dense graphs characteristic of complex, real-world scenarios, making them impractical for time-critical planning. This challenge is particularly acute in domains like mission planning for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), which demand solutions on large-scale terrain graphs. This paper introduces APULSE, a hybrid label-setting algorithm designed to efficiently solve the RCSPP on such challenging graphs. APULSE integrates a best-first search guided by an A* heuristic with aggressive, Pulse-style pruning mechanisms and a time-bucketing strategy for effective state-space reduction. A computational study, using a large-scale UGV planning scenario, benchmarks APULSE against state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that APULSE consistently finds near-optimal solutions while being orders of magnitude faster and more robust, particularly on large problem instances where competing methods fail. This superior scalability establishes APULSE as an effective solution for RCSPP in complex, large-scale environments, enabling capabilities such as interactive decision support and dynamic replanning.</p>

            <p>Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.</p>

            <p>As the automotive industry moves towards vehicle electrification, designing and optimizing thermal management systems (TMSs) for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) has become a critical focus in recent years. The dependence of battery performance on operating temperature, the lack of waste combustion heat, and the significant effect of TMS energy consumption on driving range make the design of BEV TMSs highly complicated compared to conventional vehicles. Although prior research has focused on optimizing the configuration of thermal systems for varying ambient conditions, a holistic approach to studying the full potential of reconfigurable TMS architectures has not yet been fully explored. The complex design landscape of multi-mode reconfigurable systems is difficult to navigate. Relying solely on expert intuition and creativity to identify new architectures both restricts progress and leaves significant performance improvements unrealized. In this study, using graph modelling of TMS architectures, we propose a systematic method to automatically enumerate and simulate reconfigurable architectures for a TMS, given the desired operating modes, along with a framework to conduct transient performance analysis and optimization-based trade-off studies among system performance, energy consumption, and complexity. We explored more than 150 operating mode sequences, retaining 39 unique architectures for further evaluation. MATLAB Simscape models of these architectures were automatically created and their performance evaluated. The multi-objective optimization results provide decision support for selecting the best architecture based on user priorities.</p>

            <p>Coordinated optimization dispatch (COD) of transmission system operator (TSO) and distribution system operator (DSO) can effectively ensure system security and efficiency under high-penetration distributed energy resource (DER) integration. Researches of large-scale COD problem can be categorized into iterative approaches that allow DSO to dispatch independently, and non-iterative methods based on projections of feasible regions (FR). However, the iterative methods suffer from low computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional FR. To address these issues, this paper proposes a TSO-DSO coordinated dispatch approach based on an accelerated non-iterative Equality Set Projection (ESP) algorithm. First, ESP algorithm is employed to overcome the bottleneck of high-dimensional FR construction. Second, an regularization-based accelerated method is proposed to reduce computational burden when degeneracy occurs. Accelerated ESP algorithm constructs projection of FR via adjacent facet searching. Therefore, it is less sensitive to the increase of vertices and could efficiently construct the projection of high-dimensional FR. Case studies on a polyhedron dataset, IEEE 33-Bus System and T118D10 TSO-DSO system demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed COD approach.</p>

This paper develops a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for coordination of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) that manages photovoltaic (PV) systems, batteries, and loads before, during, and after extreme weather events. A multi-objective mixed-integer quadratically constrained program is solved to enforce customer-priority tiers, serving critical loads first, while minimizing operating cost and PV curtailment under network and device constraints. Simulations on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with real UK heatwave data show that, under realistic forecast errors and modeling uncertainties, MPC improves resilience by 11-20% relative to traditional full-horizon optimization. These results indicate the practical viability of receding-horizon coordination for resilient, low-carbon VPP operation during extreme weather.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Singular Perturbation-based Model Reduction for Heterogeneous Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Huang, Dixant B. Sapkota, Manish K. Singh</p>
            <p>Power systems are globally experiencing an unprecedented growth in size and complexity due to the advent of nonconventional generation and consumption technologies. To navigate computational complexity, power system dynamic models are often reduced using techniques based on singular perturbation. However, several technical assumptions enabling traditional approaches are being challenged due to the heterogeneous, and often black-box, nature of modern power system component models. This work proposes two singular perturbation approaches that aim to optimally identify fast states that shall be reduced, without prior knowledge about the physical meaning of system states. After presenting a timescale-agnostic formulation for singular perturbation, the first approach uses greedy optimization to sequentially select states to be reduced. The second approach relies on a nonlinear optimization routine allowing state transformations while obtaining an optimally reduced model. Numerical studies on a test system featuring synchronous machines, inverters, and line dynamics demonstrate the generalizability and accuracy of the developed approaches.</p>

            <h2>Can industrial overcapacity enable seasonal flexibility in electricity use? A case study of aluminum smelting in China</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruike Lyu, Anna Li, Jianxiao Wang, Hongxi Luo, Yan Shen, Hongye Guo, Ershun Du, Chongqing Kang, Jesse Jenkins</p>
            <p>In many countries, declining demand in energy-intensive industries (EIIs) such as cement, steel, and aluminum is leading to industrial overcapacity. Although overcapacity is traditionally seen as problematic, it could unlock EIIs' flexibility in electricity use. Using China's aluminum smelting sector as a case, we evaluate the system-level cost-benefit of retaining EII overcapacity for flexible electricity use in decarbonized systems. We find that overcapacity enables smelters to adopt a seasonal operation paradigm, ceasing production during winter load peaks driven by heating electrification and renewable seasonality. In a 2050-net-zero scenario, this paradigm reduces China's electricity-system investment and operating costs by 15-72 billion CNY per year (8-34% of the industry's product value), enough to offset the costs of maintaining overcapacity and product storage. Seasonal operation also cuts workforce fluctuations across aluminum smelting and thermal-power sectors by up to 62%, potentially mitigating socio-economic disruptions from industrial restructuring and the energy transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cody Buehner, Sharaf K. Magableh, Oraib Dawaghreh, Caisheng Wang</p>
            <p>This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Modeling of Load Demand in Electrified Highways Based on the EV Composition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutossh Gupta, Vassilis Kekatos, Dionysios Aliprantis, Steve Pekarek</p>
            <p>Electrified roadways (ERs) equipped with the dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) technology can achieve longer driving range and reduce on-board battery requirements for electric vehicles (EVs). Due to the spatial arrangement of transmitter (Tx) coils embedded into the ER pavement, the power drawn by the EV's receiver (Rx) coil is oscillatory in nature. Therefore, understanding the dynamic behavior of the total DWPT load is important for power system dynamic studies. To this end, we model the load of individual EVs in the time and frequency domains for constant EV speed. We establish that a nonlinear control scheme implemented in existing DWPT-enabled EVs exhibits milder frequency harmonics compared to its linear alternative. According to this model, the harmonics of an EV load decrease in amplitude with the Rx coil length. We further propose and analyze stochastic models for the total DWPT load served by an ER segment. Our models explain how the EV composition on the ER affects its frequency spectrum. Interestingly, we show that serving more EVs with longer Rx coils (trucks) does not necessarily entail milder harmonics. Our analytical findings are corroborated using realistic flows from a traffic simulator and offer valuable insights to grid operators and ER designers.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Gradient Descent MPPT Algorithm With Complexity-Aware Benchmarking for Low-Power PV Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimia Ahmadi, Wouter A. Serdijn</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a computationally efficient, real-time maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm tailored for low-power photovoltaic (PV) systems operating under fast-changing irradiance and partial shading conditions (PSC). The proposed method augments the classical perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm with an adaptive gradient descent mechanism that dynamically scales the perturbation step size based on the instantaneous power-voltage slope, thereby minimizing tracking time and steady-state oscillations. An optional initialization routine enhances global MPP (GMPP) tracking under PSC. Extensive simulations, including irradiance recordings from freely moving rodent subjects relevant to the targeted application, and tests across varying converter topologies and temperatures, demonstrate its robust, topology-independent performance. The proposed algorithm achieves 99.94 percent MPPT efficiency under standard test conditions (STC), 99.21 percent when applied to experimental data, and more than 99.6 percent for the tested temperature profiles. Under PSC, the initialization routine improves tracking efficiency by up to 7.8 percent. A normalized gate-level complexity analysis and a unified figure-of-merit (FoM) incorporating efficiency, tracking time, and computational cost demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms 35 state-of-the-art P&O-based MPPT algorithms. These results underscore its suitability for integration in low-power power management integrated circuits (PMICs) operating under dynamic and resource-constrained conditions.</p>

            <p>This paper demonstrates how Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), grounded in Koopman operator theory, can effectively identify the main contributor(s) to oscillations in power grids. We use PMU data recorded from a real 0.15 Hz oscillation event in Denmark for post-event analysis. To this end, the EDMD algorithm processed only voltage and current phasors from nineteen PMUs at different voltage levels across the Danish grid. In such a blind-test setting with no supplementary system information, EDMD accurately pinpointed the location of the main contributor to the 0.2 Hz oscillation, consistent with the location of the problematic IBR plant later confirmed by Energinet, where the underlying cause was a control system issue. Conventional approaches, such as the dissipating energy flow (DEF) method used in the ISO-NE OSL tool did not clearly identify this plant. This joint validation with Energinet, reinforcing earlier studies using simulated IBR-dominated systems and real PMU data from ISO-NE, highlights the potential of EDMD-based post-event analysis for identifying major oscillation contributors and enabling targeted SSO mitigation.</p>

            <h2>Independent policy gradient-based reinforcement learning for economic and reliable energy management of multi-microgrid systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkai Hu, Li Xia</p>
            <p>Efficiency and reliability are both crucial for energy management, especially in multi-microgrid systems (MMSs) integrating intermittent and distributed renewable energy sources. This study investigates an economic and reliable energy management problem in MMSs under a distributed scheme, where each microgrid independently updates its energy management policy in a decentralized manner to optimize the long-term system performance collaboratively. We introduce the mean and variance of the exchange power between the MMS and the main grid as indicators for the economic performance and reliability of the system. Accordingly, we formulate the energy management problem as a mean-variance team stochastic game (MV-TSG), where conventional methods based on the maximization of expected cumulative rewards are unsuitable for variance metrics. To solve MV-TSGs, we propose a fully distributed independent policy gradient algorithm, with rigorous convergence analysis, for scenarios with known model parameters. For large-scale scenarios with unknown model parameters, we further develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on independent policy gradients, enabling data-driven policy optimization. Numerical experiments in two scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our approaches fully leverage the distributed computational capabilities of MMSs and achieve a well-balanced trade-off between economic performance and operational reliability.</p>

            <h2>Response-Based Frequency Stability Assessment under Multi-Scale Disturbances in High-Renewable Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinhui Chen, Huadong Sun, Ping Wu, Baocai Wang, Bing Zhao</p>
            <p>In high-renewable power systems, active-power disturbances are becoming larger and exhibit increasingly diverse time scales, which complicates frequency stability assessment under unanticipated events. This paper presents a response-based frequency stability assessment method that uses disturbance power, inferred from generator electrical responses, to provide a unified treatment of multi-scale disturbances. Unanticipated disturbances are first classified into short-term and permanent events; permanent disturbances are further divided into step, second-level slope and minute-level slope disturbances. Based on the measured power responses of generator groups, a unified disturbance-power model is constructed to identify the disturbance type online and to quantify disturbance intensity through the disturbance power and its rate of change. Analytical frequency-response models are then derived for each disturbance class. For step disturbances, the maximum tolerable disturbance power is obtained under steady-state and transient frequency deviation constraints, and a safety-margin index is defined. For slope-type disturbances, an improved system frequency response (SFR) model and the rotor motion equation after exhaustion of primary frequency regulation are used to compute the over-limit time of frequency deviation. The proposed response-based assessment method is validated on the CSEE-FS frequency-stability benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy for quantitative frequency stability assessment in high-renewable power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Denis V. Coury, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes</p>
            <p>Digital substations have significantly enhanced power grid protection by replacing traditional copper wiring with fiber-optic communication and integrating IEC 61850-compliant Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), resulting in greater efficiency, reliability, and interoperability. While these advancements provide improved interoperability, challenges such as high costs, complex networks, and limited upgradeability persist. To mitigate these issues, the virtualization of IEDs has emerged as a cost-effective solution, offering scalability, simplified maintenance, and reduced hardware costs by replacing traditional hardware-based IEDs with software-based counterparts. However, the performance and reliability of virtual IEDs (vIED) must be rigorously evaluated to ensure their robustness in real-time applications. This paper develops, implements, and evaluates a vIED designed to match the performance of its hardware-based counterparts. The vIED was deployed on a server using virtual machines, with its core logic implemented in low-level programming languages to ensure high-speed, deterministic behavior. The performance was evaluated using real-time simulations, focusing on the response times of the protection functions. The results demonstrated that vIEDs achieved acceptable response times, validating their suitability for deployment in critical time-sensitive environments within digital substations.</p>

            <h2>Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation of Large Language Models for Numeric Anomaly Detection in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichen Liu, Hongyu Wu, Bo Liu</p>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in power grids for their general-purpose capabilities. Meanwhile, anomaly detection (AD) remains critical for grid resilience, requiring accurate and interpretable decisions based on multivariate telemetry. Yet the performance of LLMs on large-scale numeric data for AD remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for numeric AD in power systems. We use GPT-OSS-20B as a representative model and evaluate it on the IEEE 14-bus system. A standardized prompt framework is applied across zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning, and a hybrid LLM-traditional approach. We adopt a rule-aware design based on the three-sigma criterion, and report detection performance and rationale quality. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into the limitations and capabilities of LLM-based AD and its integration with classical detectors in cyber-physical power grid applications.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates how grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) control strategies in inverter-based resources (IBRs) influence line distance and differential protection in converter-dominated transmission systems. A modified IEEE 39-bus system is evaluated with GFM and GFL units equipped with low-voltage ride-through logic, current limiting, and positive- or negative-sequence prioritization. Distance protection is implemented with a mho characteristic, while line differential protection uses an alpha-plane approach. Results show that phase-to-ground loops in distance protection can substantially overestimate the fault location near the Zone-1 reach. For line differential protection, external faults may cause the operating point to briefly enter the trip region of the alpha-plane, even for the healthy-phase in ABG faults under GFL control and during the initial moments of the fault, demanding strong external security measures. These findings highlight that modern converter controls, together with current limitation and sequence-current prioritization, can compromise the reliability and security of traditional protection schemes.</p>

What is the optimal volume of storage in a power system and on what does it depend? In addition, what form of hedge contracts do storage facilities require? We answer these questions in the special case in which the uncertainty in the power system involves successive draws of an independent, identically-distributed random variable. We characterize the conditions for the optimal operation of, and investment in, storage and show how these conditions can be understood graphically using price-duration curves. We also characterize the optimal hedge contracts for storage units.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Transmission Flexibility under Uncertainty: Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyi Zhou, Christoph Graf, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.</p>

            <p>Environmental licensing related to underwater acoustic emissions represents a critical bottleneck for the commercial deployment of marine renewable energy. This study presents a control engineering framework to mitigate acoustic risks from tidal current converters without compromising project viability. A MATLAB/Simulink model of a tidal current converter was utilised to evaluate two distinct mitigation tiers: (1) architectural modification, comparing a geared induction generator against a direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator, and (2) operational control, analysing the impact of switching frequencies and maximum power point tracking coefficient tuning. Results indicate that lowering switching frequencies is ineffective, increasing power electronic losses by over 2000% with negligible acoustic benefit. Conversely, the direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator architecture reduced sound pressure levels, effectively eliminating mechanical tonal noise. For existing geared systems, de-tuning the maximum power point tracking coefficient by a factor of 1.2 reduced the probability of exceeding temporary threshold shift limits for marine mammals, with a quantified energy yield reduction of 3.58%. These findings propose a hierarchical mitigation strategy: selecting direct-drive topologies for acoustically sensitive sites, and utilising maximum power point tracking coefficient based power curtailment as a transient operational mode during critical biological migration periods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Denis V. Coury, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes</p>
            <p>Digital substations have significantly enhanced power grid protection by replacing traditional copper wiring with fiber-optic communication and integrating IEC 61850-compliant Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), resulting in greater efficiency, reliability, and interoperability. While these advancements provide improved interoperability, challenges such as high costs, complex networks, and limited upgradeability persist. To mitigate these issues, the virtualization of IEDs has emerged as a cost-effective solution, offering scalability, simplified maintenance, and reduced hardware costs by replacing traditional hardware-based IEDs with software-based counterparts. However, the performance and reliability of virtual IEDs (vIED) must be rigorously evaluated to ensure their robustness in real-time applications. This paper develops, implements, and evaluates a vIED designed to match the performance of its hardware-based counterparts. The vIED was deployed on a server using virtual machines, with its core logic implemented in low-level programming languages to ensure high-speed, deterministic behavior. The performance was evaluated using real-time simulations, focusing on the response times of the protection functions. The results demonstrated that vIEDs achieved acceptable response times, validating their suitability for deployment in critical time-sensitive environments within digital substations.</p>

            <h2>Analytical Phasor-Based Fault Location Enhancement for Wind Farm Collector Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alailton J. Alves Junior, Daniel Barbosa, Ricardo A. S. Fernandes, Denis V. Coury</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) is reshaping fault current characteristics, presenting significant challenges to traditional protection and fault location methods. This paper addresses a key limitation in fault location within wind farm collector networks, i.e., one-terminal phasor-based methods become inaccurate when IBRs are electrically located downstream from the fault. In such cases, the voltage drop caused by IBR fault current injections is not captured by the Intelligent Electronic Device, resulting in a systematic overestimation of fault distance. To mitigate this issue, a general compensation framework was proposed by augmenting classical loop formulations with a distance-dependent voltage correction term. The methodology was derived analytically using a sequence-domain representation and generalized to multiple fault types through a unified notation. It maintains the simplicity and interpretability of conventional approaches and can be implemented using only local measurements. The method was evaluated through EMT simulations in PSCAD using a realistic wind farm model. Results show significant improvements in location accuracy, with average and maximum errors notably reduced, especially for ground-involved faults where reductions exceed 90\%. Furthermore, the compensation eliminates sensitivity to wind penetration levels and ensures uniform performance across feeders, positioning the method as a practical solution for modern renewable-dominated grids.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation of Large Language Models for Numeric Anomaly Detection in Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichen Liu, Hongyu Wu, Bo Liu</p>
            <p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in power grids for their general-purpose capabilities. Meanwhile, anomaly detection (AD) remains critical for grid resilience, requiring accurate and interpretable decisions based on multivariate telemetry. Yet the performance of LLMs on large-scale numeric data for AD remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for numeric AD in power systems. We use GPT-OSS-20B as a representative model and evaluate it on the IEEE 14-bus system. A standardized prompt framework is applied across zero-shot, few-shot, in-context learning, low rank adaptation (LoRA), fine-tuning, and a hybrid LLM-traditional approach. We adopt a rule-aware design based on the three-sigma criterion, and report detection performance and rationale quality. This study lays the groundwork for further investigation into the limitations and capabilities of LLM-based AD and its integration with classical detectors in cyber-physical power grid applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darryl Biggar, Mohammad Reza Hesamzadeh</p>
            <p>Electric power systems are increasingly turning to energy storage systems to balance supply and demand. But how much storage is required? What is the optimal volume of storage in a power system and on what does it depend? In addition, what form of hedge contracts do storage facilities require? We answer these questions in the special case in which the uncertainty in the power system involves successive draws of an independent, identically-distributed random variable. We characterize the conditions for the optimal operation of, and investment in, storage and show how these conditions can be understood graphically using price-duration curves. We also characterize the optimal hedge contracts for storage units.</p>

            <h2>Unlocking Transmission Flexibility under Uncertainty: Getting Dynamic Line Ratings into Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyi Zhou, Christoph Graf, Yury Dvorkin</p>
            <p>Static transmission line ratings may lead to underutilization of line capacity due to overly conservative assumptions. Grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) such as dynamic line ratings (DLRs), which adjust line capacity based on real-time conditions, are a techno-economically viable alternative to increase the utilization of existing power lines. Nonetheless, their adoption has been slow, partly due to the absence of operational tools that effectively account for simultaneous impacts on dispatch and pricing. In this paper, we represent transmission capacity with DLRs as a stock-like resource with time-variant interdependency, which is modeled via an approximation of line temperature evolution process, decoupling the impacts of ambient weather conditions and power flow on transmission line temperature and thus capacity. We integrate DLRs into a multi-period DC optimal power flow problem, with chance constrains addressing correlated uncertainty in DLRs and renewable generation. This yields non-convex problems that we transform into a tractable convex form by linearization. We derive locational marginal energy and ancillary services prices consistent with a competitive equilibrium. Numerical experiments on the 11-zone and 1814-node NYISO systems demonstrate its performance, including impacts on dispatch, pricing, and marginal carbon emissions.</p>

            <h2>Power sector models featuring individual BEV profiles: Assessing the time-accuracy trade-off</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adeline Guéret</p>
            <p>Electrifying passenger cars will impact future power systems. To understand the challenges and opportunities that arise, it is necessary to reflect "sector coupling" in the modeling space. This paper focuses on a specific modeling approach that includes dozens of individual BEV profiles rather than one aggregated BEV profile. Although including additional BEV profiles increases model complexity and runtime, it avoids losing information in the aggregation process. We investigate how many profiles are needed to ensure the accuracy of the results and the extent to which fewer profiles can be traded for runtime efficiency gains. We also examine whether selecting specific profiles influences optimal results. We demonstrate that including too few profiles may result in distorted optimal solutions. However, beyond a certain threshold, adding more profiles does not significantly enhance the robustness of the results. More generally, for fleets of 5 to 20 million BEVs, we derive a rule of thumb consisting in including enough profiles such that each profile represents 200,000 to 250,000 vehicles, ensuring accurate results without excessive runtime.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Risk and Revenue in the Nordic 15-minute mFRR market: An EV Aggregation Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Theodor Hagström, Lars Herre</p>
            <p>Decarbonisation, decentralisation, and intermittency are driving the development of flexibility markets towards shorter market time units (MTU). Shorter MTUs and shorter gate closures lower the entrance barriers of demand side aggregators that face significant uncertainty on longer time scales. We study the business case for aggregated EV fleets participating in the Nordic 15-minute mFRR Energy Activation Market (EAM). Motivated by increasing system granularity and rapid EV uptake, we represent fleet flexibility as a virtual battery with time-varying power and energy envelopes and formulate a risk-aware stochastic optimisation that co-ordinates day-ahead scheduling with quarter-hour mFRR bidding. Using synthetic residential charging cohorts and observed day-ahead prices on two stylised days, we compare an independent day-ahead baseline to a co-optimised strategy under conservative availability and a CVaR-augmented objective. Across both price cases, co-optimisation increases expected profit and lowers downside risk: the model buys less energy day-ahead and shifts procurement toward mFRR down while flattening the charging plan to retain eligibility for mFRR up. Profit decomposition shows that the uplift is driven by higher mFRR down revenues and reduced reliance on unwinding day-ahead positions. We discuss operational implications for bidding and outline two extensions: rolling 45-minute re-optimisation and a V2G framework.</p>

            <h2>An Exact Solution Algorithm for the Bi-Level Optimization Problem of Electric Vehicles Charging Station Placement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mobina Nankali, Michael W. Levin</p>
            <p>This work addresses electric vehicle (EV) charging station placement through a bi-level optimization model, where the upper-level planner maximizes net revenue by selecting station locations under budget constraints, while EV users at the lower level choose routes and charging stations to minimize travel and charging costs. To account for range anxiety, we construct a battery-expanded network and apply a shortest path algorithm with Frank-Wolfe traffic assignment. Our primary contribution is developing the first exact solution algorithm for large scale EV charging station placement problems. We propose a Branch-and-Price-and-Cut algorithm enhanced with value function cuts and column generation. While existing research relies on heuristic methods that provide no optimality guarantees or exact algorithms that require prohibitively long runtimes, our exact algorithm delivers globally optimal solutions with mathematical certainty under a reasonable runtime. Computational experiments on the Eastern Massachusetts network (74 nodes, 248 links), the Anaheim network (416 nodes, 914 links), and the Barcelona network (110 zones, 1,020 nodes, and 2,512 links) demonstrate exceptional performance. Our algorithm terminates within minutes rather than hours, while achieving optimality gaps below 1% across all instances. This result represents a computational speedup of over two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. The algorithm successfully handles problems with over 300,000 feasible combinations, which transform EV charging infrastructure planning from a computationally prohibitive problem into a tractable optimization task suitable for practical decision making problem for real world networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youzhe Yang, Hafiz Majid Hussain, Juha Haakana, Pedro Nardelli</p>
            <p>A vital strategy for ports to mitigate the environmental impact of the maritime industry, while complying with frameworks such as the European Green Deal and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), entails the systematic implementation of comprehensive energy management solutions. This paper provides a baseline evaluation of the energy management systems (EMSs) implementation and their impact on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and operational costs in smart ports. Initially, we provide a systematic review of the literature focusing on case studies from prominent ports, including Hamburg, Genoa, Jurong, and Shanghai Yangshan Phase IV. The analysis emphasises key aspects such as energy efficiency, reductions in emissions, and the minimization of operational costs. Subsequently, we formulate an optimisation model to simulate load dispatch, carbon emission reduction, and transport scheduling. Results indicate that EMS deployment reduces annual energy consumption and carbon emissions significantly by approximately 7%-8% and 11%-12% respectively, while achieving substantial cost savings of 30%. The study also identifies critical challenges, including system integration, data quality issues, cybersecurity risks, and the need for standardization. These findings provide valuable insights for port authorities and policymakers, supporting the transition toward more sustainable and efficient port operations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Accelerating Newton-Raphson Convergence with Ising Machines: A Case Study for Power Flow Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeynab Kaseb, Matthias Moller, Lindsay Spoor, Jerry J. Guo, Yu Xiang, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>The Newton-Raphson (NR) method is widely used for solving power flow (PF) equations due to its quadratic convergence. However, its performance deteriorates under poor initialization or extreme operating scenarios, e.g., high levels of renewable energy penetration. Traditional NR initialization strategies often fail to address these challenges, resulting in slow convergence or even divergence. We propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the initialization of NR, and introduce a novel quantum-enhanced RL environment update mechanism to mitigate the significant computational cost of evaluating power system states over a combinatorially large action space at each RL timestep by formulating the voltage adjustment task as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. Specifically, quantum/digital annealers are integrated into the RL environment update to evaluate state transitions using a problem Hamiltonian designed for PF. Results demonstrate significant improvements in convergence speed, a reduction in NR iteration counts, and enhanced robustness under different operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>LLM-Driven Transient Stability Assessment: From Automated Simulation to Neural Architecture Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lianzhe Hu, Yu Wang, Bikash Pal</p>
            <p>This paper presents an LLM-driven, end-to-end workflow that addresses the lack of automation and intelligence in power system transient stability assessment (TSA). The proposed agentic framework integrates large language models (LLMs) with a professional simulator (ANDES) to automatically generate and filter disturbance scenarios from natural language, and employs an LLM-driven Neural Network Design (LLM-NND) pipeline to autonomously design and optimize TSA models through performance-guided, closed-loop feedback. On the IEEE 39-bus system, the LLM-NND models achieve 93.71% test accuracy on four-class TSA with only 4.78M parameters, while maintaining real-time inference latency (less than 0.95 ms per sample). Compared with a manually designed DenseNet (25.9M parameters, 80.05% accuracy), the proposed approach jointly improves accuracy and efficiency. Ablation studies confirm that the synergy among domain-grounded retrieval, reasoning augmentation, and feedback mechanisms is essential for robust automation. The results demonstrate that LLM agents can reliably accelerate TSA research from scenario generation and data acquisition to model design and interpretation, offering a scalable paradigm that is readily extensible to other power system tasks such as optimal power flow, fault analysis, and market operations.</p>

This paper presents a backbone model of a smart grid to test alternative scenarios for the grid. This tool simulates disparate systems to validate assumptions before the human scale model. Thanks to a distributed optimization of subsystems, the production and consumption scheduling is achieved while maintaining flexibility and scalability.</p>

            <h2>Shaping Frequency Dynamics in Modern Power Systems with Grid-forming Converters</h2>

            <p>In this paper, frequency dynamics in modern power systems with a high penetration of converter-based generation is analysed. A fundamental analysis of the frequency dynamics is performed to identify the limitations and challenges when the converter penetration is increased. The voltage-source behaviour is found as an essential characteristic of converters to improve the initial frequency derivative of Synchronous Generators (SGs). A detailed small-signal analysis, based on the system's eigenvalues, participation factors and mode shapes, is then performed in a reduced system for different converter penetrations, showing that the flexibility of grid-forming (GFOR) converters as well as the system's inertia reduction may lead to have a more controllable system frequency. First-order frequency responses can be programmed for high converter penetrations, when GFOR operation can impose their dominance over SGs. These results have been validated in the IEEE 118-bus system simulated in PSCAD.</p>

Grounded in the effective load carrying capability (ELCC) metric, the proposed capacity accreditation employs a convex optimization engine that jointly dispatches colocated resources to minimize reliability risk.

            <h2>Energy Control Strategy to Enhance AC Fault Ride-Through in Offshore Wind MMC-HVDC Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dileep Kumar, Wajiha Shireen</p>
            <p>Modular Multilevel Converter-based High Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) system is a promising technology for integration of offshore wind farms (OWFs). However, onshore AC faults on MMC-HVDC reduce the power transfer capability of onshore converter station, leading to surplus power accumulation in HVDC link. This surplus power causes a rapid rise in DC-link voltage and may hinder safe operation of OWFs. To address such a situation, this paper presents an AC fault ride-through scheme that combines the storage of surplus power in MMC submodule (SM) capacitors and dissipation of residual power in an energy dissipation device (EDD). The proposed energy control facilitates use of half-bridge MMC SMs with low-capacitance, with their storage capacity leveraged to share the surplus power during faults, with a lower-rated EDD. The proposed scheme is tested on a 640kV/420MW MMC-HVDC system. The results show that proposed control scheme effectively maintains DC link voltages, ensuring connection of OWFs.</p>

            <p>This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the power sector in Bangladesh, how the country has dealt with it, and explores the path to stability. The study employs data visualisation and complex statistics to examine critical data about power systems in Bangladesh. This includes load patterns on a daily, monthly, annual, weekend, and weekday basis. Significant alterations in these patterns have been observed during our study e.g., in April and May of 2020, the power demand decreased by approximately 15.4% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. We have used a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework to predict the load profile of 2020 excluding COVID-19 effects. This model is compared with the actual load profile to determine the degree to which COVID-19 has impacted. The comparison indicates that the average power demand decreased by approximately 19.5% in April 2020 and 18.3% in May 2020, relative to its projected value. The study also investigates system stability by analyzing transmission loss and load factor, and the environmental effect by analyzing the Carbon Dioxide emission rate. Finally, the study provides recommendations for overcoming future disasters, such as developing more resilient power systems, investing in renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of the low-altitude economy has imposed unprecedented demands on wireless infrastructure to accommodate large-scale drone deployments and facilitate intelligent services in dynamic airspace environments. However, unlocking its full potential in practical applications presents significant challenges. Traditional aerial systems predominantly focus on air-ground communication services, often neglecting the integration of sensing, computation, control, and energy-delivering functions, which hinders the ability to meet diverse mission-critical demands. Besides, the absence of systematic low-altitude airspace planning and management exacerbates issues regarding dynamic interference in three-dimensional space, coverage instability, and scalability. To overcome these challenges, a comprehensive framework, termed low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), has emerged to seamlessly integrate communication, sensing, computation, control, and air traffic management into a unified design. This article provides a comprehensive overview of LAWN systems, introducing LAWN system fundamentals and the evolution of functional designs. Subsequently, we delve into performance evaluation metrics and review critical concerns surrounding privacy and security in the open-air network environment. Finally, we present the cutting-edge developments in airspace structuring and air traffic management, providing insights to facilitate the practical deployment of LAWNs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Guo, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Zhendong Li, Kunlun Wang, Hongying Tang, Jun Li</p>
            <p>This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver configuration. Within this system framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming of the TRIS transceiver, subject to the power constraints of each TRIS transceiver unit. Since the objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear superiority of the deployment of the TRIS transceiver over the benchmark schemes.</p>

            <p>Performance ratio (PR) is a established measure of efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems. While previous research demonstrated the effects of meteorological and technical variables on PR, a gap persists in the literature on which variables strongly influence PR in large-scale, real-world, heterogeneous PV systems. This paper aims to fill this gap, applying data-driven models to PV systems located in Rondônia State, Brazil, to identify which variables strongly influence annual PR, and, hence, should be the target for optimization. Surprisingly, only negligible effects were found between meteorological and technical variables on annual PR, indicating that human-factors (such as installation, monitoring, and maintenance quality) might have a stronger effect. These findings indicates that, to improve performance of PV systems, policy makers could focus on creating educational programs to teach PV installers and technicians how to properly install, monitor, and maintain modern PV systems. Through estimating the probability density functions of PR, its peak value was found as 78.85% (mean 77.52%, 95% confidence interval of 76.12% to 78.84%, and 95% prediction interval of 58.83% to 92.70%). A map of annual final yield was developed for Rondônia State and can be used by entrepreneurs to quickly and cheaply estimate energy production.</p>

            <h2>State-Derivative Feedback Control for Damping Low-Frequency Oscillations in Bulk Power Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MST Rumi Akter, Anamitra Pal, Rajasekhar Anguluri</p>
            <p>Low-frequency oscillations remain a major challenge in bulk power systems with high renewable penetration, long lines, and large loads. Existing damping strategies based on power modulation of high voltage DC (HVDC) or energy storage, are often limited by fixed control architectures, leaving some modes poorly damped. This paper introduces a state-derivative feedback (SDF) damping controller that uses both frequency and its rate of change as feedback signals. Incorporating state derivatives enhances modal damping and accelerates frequency recovery, enabling HVDC and energy storage to effectively stabilize the grid. We evaluate the SDF controller on two- and three-area systems and compare performance with a frequency difference-based damping scheme. Results show that the SDF control reproduces state-feedback performance while providing good damping of both inter- and intra-area oscillations compared to the frequency-difference method, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for stabilizing power-electronics-rich grids.</p>

            <p>As the world shifts towards utilizing natural resources for electricity generation, there is need to enhance forecasting systems to guarantee a stable electricity provision and to incorporate the generated power into the network systems. This work provides a machine learning environment for renewable energy forecasting that prevents the flaws which are usually experienced in the actual process; intermittency, nonlinearity and intricacy in nature which is difficult to grasp by ordinary existing forecasting procedures. Leveraging a comprehensive approximately 30-year dataset encompassing multiple renewable energy sources, our research evaluates two distinct approaches: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Non-Linear Autoregressive distributed called with Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast total power generation using the solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources. The framework uses high temporal resolution and multiple parameters of the environment to improve the predictions. The fact that both the models in terms of error metrics were equally significant and had some unique tendencies at certain circumstances. The long history allows for better model calibration of temporal fluctuations and seasonal and climatic effects on power generation. The reliability enhancement in the prediction function, which benefits from 30 years of data, has value to grid operators, energy traders, and those establishing renewable energy policies and standards concerning reliability</p>

            <h2>Power Flow Solution in Unbalanced 3-Wire MV and 4-Wire LV Networks Using Symmetrical and Eigen-basis Coordinates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abduljalil S. Aljadani, Firdous U. Nazir, Bikash C. Pal, Izudin Džafić, Rabih A. Jabr</p>
            <p>The large penetration of distributed generations impacts both the secondary low-voltage (LV) and the primary medium-voltage (MV) segments of the distribution network. Optimizing power flow calculations for the integrated MV/LV networks is crucial for the real-time management of modern distribution networks. Traditional methods in symmetrical coordinates are primarily limited to the three-wire model of three-phase networks, often leading to inaccuracies in power flow calculations when applied to three-phase four-wire LV segments. This paper introduces a novel power flow method for integrated three-wire MV and four-wire LV networks. Using eigenvector decomposition to diagonalize the admittance matrix of four-wire LV lines, the proposed method improves the computational efficiency of power flow calculations and accurately calculates the neutral-to-ground voltage. The results of the case studies show over 50\% reduction in the number of non-zero elements in the LU factors of the bus admittance matrix, and speed-up factors of 2.78 on the IEEE 123-node test system and 3.63 on the IEEE 8500-node test system in execution times for Volt/Var control (VVC), compared to the phase coordinates model.</p>

            <h2>The Iberian Blackout: A Black Swan or a Gray Rhino? A Thorough Power System Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdallah Alalem Albustami, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>On April 28, 2025, the Iberian power system suffered a full blackout. It was the first documented overvoltage-driven cascade in Europe. The event sparked debate about root causes, including high renewables output, low inertia, and operator actions. This paper presents a thorough power system analysis of the incident to sort signal from noise and explain, step by step, how the blackout unfolded. Specifically, we (i) reconstruct the timeline and causal chain of the incident, (ii) present and summarize contributing factors using factual findings from incident reports, (iii) reproduce the blackout on an IEEE test system, (iv) analyze the incident from a system-theoretic, voltage-control perspective, and (v) translate our analysis into practical, technical measures that aim to mitigate and prevent similar incidents.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Nicklaus, Lea Brass, Gunnar Schubert</p>
            <p>We study linear policy approximations for the risk-conscious operation of an industrial energy system with uncertain wind power, significant and variable electricity demand, and high thermal output, as found in a modern foundry. The system incorporates thermal storage and operates under rolling forecasts, leading to a sequential decision-making framework. To address uncertainty in key parameters, we formulate chance-constrained optimization problems that limit the probability of critical constraint violations, such as unmet demand requirements or the exceedance of system boundaries. To reduce computational effort, we replace direct uncertainty handling with a parameter-modified cost function that approximates the underlying risk structure. We validate our method through a numerical case study, demonstrating the trade-offs between operational efficiency and reliability in a stochastic environment.</p>

            <h2>System Synchronization Based on Complex Frequency</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusen Wei, Lan Tang, Peidong Li</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable energy leads to a continuous reduction in system inertia, for which conventional synchronization criteria based solely on frequency consistency can no longer accurately capture the coupled dynamics of frequency and voltage during transients. To address this issue, this paper employs the concept of complex frequency and develops an analysis framework that integrates theory, indices, and simulation for assessing synchronization stability in low-inertia power systems. First, the basic concepts and mathematical formulation of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization are introduced. Then, dynamic criteria for local and global complex synchronization are established, upon which a complex inertia index is proposed. This index unifies the supporting role of traditional frequency inertia and the voltage support capability associated with voltage inertia, enabling quantitative evaluation of the strength of coordinated frequency-voltage support and disturbance rejection within a region. Finally, transient simulations on a modified IEEE 9-bus system are carried out to validate the proposed method. The results show that the method can clearly reveal the synchronization relationships between subnetworks and the overall system, providing a useful theoretical reference for stability analysis and control strategy design in low-inertia power systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Saiful Islam, Rahul Bhadani</p>
            <p>We present a load frequency control strategy deploying a decentralized robust global integral terminal sliding mode control (GITSMC) method to maintain stable frequency and tie-line power in multi-area interconnected microgrids with aggregated uncertainties. To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.</p>

            <p>Advances in AI and Robotics have accelerated significant initiatives in agriculture, particularly in the areas of robot navigation and 3D digital twin creation. A significant bottleneck impeding this progress is the critical lack of "in-the-wild" datasets that capture the full complexities of real farmland, including non-rigid motion from wind, drastic illumination variance, and morphological changes resulting from growth. This data gap fundamentally limits research on robust AI models for autonomous field navigation and scene-level dynamic 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a modular robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture these dynamic farmland conditions. Our platform integrates multiple sensors, enabling remote, time-synchronized acquisition of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, IMU, and Pose data for efficient and repeatable long-term data collection in real-world agricultural environments. We successfully collected 18TB of data over one month, documenting the entire growth cycle of Canola under diverse illumination conditions. We benchmark state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods on AgriChrono, revealing the profound challenge of reconstructing high-fidelity, dynamic non-rigid scenes in such farmland settings. This benchmark validates AgriChrono as a critical asset for advancing model generalization, and its public release is expected to significantly accelerate research and development in precision agriculture.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luke Dosiek, Akaash Karn, Frank Liu</p>
            <p>This paper describes a new approach for using changepoint detection (CPD) to estimate the starting and stopping times of a forced oscillation (FO) in measured power system data. As with a previous application of CPD to this problem, the pruned exact linear time (PELT) algorithm is used. However, instead of allowing PELT to automatically tune its penalty parameter, a method of manually providing it is presented that dramatically reduces computation time without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the new algorithm requires fewer input parameters and provides a formal, data-driven approach to setting the minimum FO segment length to consider as troublesome for an electromechanical mode meter. A low-order ARMAX representation of the minniWECC model is used to test the approach, where a 98\% reduction in computation time is enjoyed with high estimation accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Spatially Dependent Sampling of Component Failures for Power System Preventive Control Against Hurricane</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyue Li, Guanglun Zhang, Grant Ruan, Haiwang Zhong, Chongqing Kang</p>
            <p>Preventive control is a crucial strategy for power system operation against impending natural hazards, and its effectiveness fundamentally relies on the realism of scenario generation. While most existing studies employ sequential Monte Carlo simulation and assume independent sampling of component failures, this oversimplification neglects the spatial correlations induced by meteorological factors such as hurricanes. In this paper, we identify and address the gap in modeling spatial dependence among component failures under extreme weather. We analyze how the mean, variance, and correlation structure of weather intensity random variables influence the correlation of component failures. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially dependent sampling method that enables joint sampling of multiple component failures by generating correlated meteorological intensity random variables. Comparative studies show that our approach captures long-tailed scenarios and reveals more extreme events than conventional methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of scenario selection on preventive control performance. Our key findings are: (1) Strong spatial correlations in uncertain weather intensity consistently lead to interdependent component failures, regardless of mean value level; (2) The proposed method uncovers more high-severity scenarios that are missed by independent sampling; (3) Preventive control requires balancing load curtailment and over-generation costs under different scenario severities; (4) Ignoring failure correlations results in underestimating risk from high-severity events, undermining the robustness of preventive control strategies.</p>

            <p>We study the optimal green hydrogen production and energy market participation of a renewable-colocated hydrogen producer (RCHP) that utilizes onsite renewable generation for both hydrogen production and grid services. Under deterministic and stochastic profit-maximization frameworks, we analyze RCHP's multiple market participation models and derive closed-form optimal scheduling policies that dynamically allocate renewable energy to hydrogen production and electricity export to the wholesale market. Analytical characterizations of the RCHP's operating profit and the optimal sizing of renewable and electrolyzer capacities are obtained. We use real-time renewable production and electricity price data from three independent system operators to assess impacts from market prices and environmental policies of renewable energy and green hydrogen subsidies on RCHP's profitability.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Study on Cyber Attack Vectors in EV Traction Power Electronics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhesh Pimpale</p>
            <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have drastically changed the auto industry and developed a new era of technologies where power electronics play the leading role in traction management, energy conversion and vehicle control processes. Nevertheless, this is a digital transformation, and the cyber-attack surface area has increased considerably, to the point that EV traction power electronics are becoming vulnerable to various cybersecurity risks. This paper is able to provide its expertise on possible cyber-attack vectors which can attack important parts of the traction, powertrain, including things like inverters, motor controllers, and communicated systems within the embedded bits. Using the (STRIDE) threat modeling framework, the research outlines and groups the vulnerabilities of the architecture and runs some attack simulations, such as the Denial of Service (DoS), spoofing, firmware manipulation, and data injection. The experiments prove the fact that a slight interruption in the control signal, the sensed data may lead to the severe working implications, such as unstable sensor values of the torque, abnormal voltage shifts, and entire system freezes. These results highlight the high priority on the need of injective embedded intrusion preventive mechanisms and secure design of firmware in EV powertrain electronics. In this paper, the author makes his contribution to the general body of knowledge that underpins the links existing between cyber security practices and the peculiar needs of automotive power electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshay K. Rao, Fletcher T. Chapin, Erin Musabandesu, Adhithyan Sakthivelu, Carson Tucker, Daly Wettermark, Meagan S. Mauter</p>
            <p>Load shifting by commercial and industrial power consumers reduces costs and Scope 2 emissions for the consumer and the grid. Incentivizing this behavior requires tools for valuing flexibility amidst the heterogeneity in load characteristics across diverse sectors and the spatiotemporal variation in electricity prices and emissions factors. This work presents a top-down approach to screen and broadly understand the benefits of flexibility based on system uptime, power capacity (PC), energy capacity (EC), and round- trip efficiency (RTE). Depending on the region and season, cost savings from flexibility range from 0 to over 100% and emissions savings are generally bounded between 5-40%. We also find the magnitude and cost of emissions abatement from flexibility is highly variable and, in some cases, up to four orders of magnitude less than regional renewable energy credits or common investing or policy benchmarks like the social cost of carbon. While the value of flexibility is highly dynamic, estimating savings as a function of load characteristics and incentives can inform heuristic design of new systems, siting strategies, comparison of flexibility to other decarbonization options, and new avenues for incentivizing flexibility.</p>

            <h2>Transient Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Converters with Current Limiting Considering Asymmetrical Grid Faults</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongyeon Kim, Ki-Hyun Kim, Shenghui Cui, Jae-Jung Jung</p>
            <p>Under asymmetrical faults, analyzing the transient stability of grid-forming voltage-source converters (GFM-VSCs) becomes essential because their behavior fundamentally differs from that under symmetrical faults. When current limiting is activated under asymmetrical faults, the point-of-common-coupling voltage of a GFM-VSC contains both positive- and negative-sequence components, and the interaction between these components generates a non-negligible negative-sequence-driven active power. However, the transient stability of GFM-VSCs under asymmetrical faults has not been sufficiently investigated, and the influence of negative-sequence-driven active power remains unclear. Accordingly, this letter derives the P-{\delta} curve of a GFM-VSC with an elliptical current limiter under asymmetrical faults by explicitly accounting for negative-sequence effects. This enables a more accurate transient stability assessment when extending conventional symmetrical-fault analyses to asymmetrical conditions. The theoretical analysis is validated by the agreement between the derived P-{\delta} curve and both simulation and experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Plouton Grammatikos, Ali Mohamed Ali, Fabrizio Sossan</p>
            <p>This paper describes a method for computing price signals for prosumers, incentivizing them to adjust their consumption according to the constraints of the distribution grids to which they are connected, thereby preventing voltage violations and line congestion. The proposed method leverages an interpretation of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which enables the extraction of a price signal to coordinate the operations of prosumers and the distribution grid's constraints while limiting the sharing of sensitive information among them. The method can be used by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to dynamically adjust a pre-existing retail electricity tariff (e.g., a constant or time-of-use tariff), thereby triggering grid-support actions from prosumers. The method is validated experimentally in a 9-node low-voltage distribution grid laboratory with real components (lines and controllable power converters). The experiments validate the algorithm's performance in terms of convergence and operational efficiency, demonstrating its viability in a real-life setting.</p>

            <p>This article proposes an optimization problem formulation to find the optimal sizes of Photovoltaics (PV) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for individual participants within the context of the Renewable Energy Community (REC). An optimization problem considered the dynamic nature of electricity pricing, solar irradiation levels, financial aspects such as capital investment, and operational and maintenance expenditures of PV and BESS. The analysis also considered replacement costs and the efficiency of charging and discharging the BESS unit. We employed Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) to determine the optimal system size that maximizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of individual participants. Furthermore, in this study, we used daily representative signals for each season of the year to reduce simulation runtime. The Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) was used to extract these signals. Then, these representative signals obtained were used in the optimization problem formulation to reduce simulation time and extend our analysis to a wider planning horizon. In addition, the study introduced fairness by applying the individual marginal contribution method to distribute incentives equitably among REC participants, ensuring that each member benefited from their contribution. A simulation study was conducted using a real demand dataset of five houses located in Roseto Valfortore, a small town and commune in the Foggia Province of the Apulia region in southern Italy, to demonstrate the practical relevance and usefulness of the ideas discussed. Ultimately, the goal of the article was to empower the REC with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and shape the future of sustainable energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Haag, Yuhao Chen, Giri Venkataramanan, Manish K. Singh</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of large data center loads and inverter-based generation is increasing the stress on transmission networks, while expanding grid capacity at the required pace remains challenging. Power flow controllers (PFCs) that adjust effective line reactances to redistribute flows are often viewed as an interim solution to improve transmission network utilization. Traditional flexibility metrics and analysis approaches for PFCs focus on a limited number of operating points and contingencies. Towards gaining system-wide insights, this paper introduces a framework to quantify network flow controllability- the extent to which line flows can be reshaped through reactance adjustments. We derive analytical results demonstrating that installing PFCs on all lines enables complete controllability of feasible flow patterns. Building on these, we conduct empirical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system to examine how controllability varies with the number of PFCs and their reactance adjustment range. These analyses employ a mixed-integer linear program to optimize the siting and sizing of PFCs. Finally, we validate findings under AC power flow physics using an optimization routine that steers flows toward desired setpoints.</p>

            <p>Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</p>

One form of coordination is to solve the overall system operation problem in a hierarchical way, computing Feasible Operational Regions (FORs) for the interconnection between TSO/DSO. Most methods for computing FORs rely on the assumption of only one interconnection point between TSO and DSOs, which is often violated in practice. In this work, we propose a method for computing FORs in distribution grids with multiple interconnection points to the transmission grid. We test our method in a grid with two interconnecting points and analyze the properties of the resulting high-dimensional FOR from a power systems perspective.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huseyin Goksu</p>
            <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.</p>

            <h2>GegenbauerNet: Finding the Optimal Compromise in the GNN Flexibility-Stability Trade-off</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huseyin Goksu</p>
            <p>Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.</p>

            <h2>Tri-Level Stochastic-Robust Co-Planning of Distribution Networks and Renewable Charging Stations With an Adaptive iC&CG Algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongheng Wang, Xiemin Mo, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Renewable charging stations (RCSs) that co-locate electric-vehicle (EV) charging with distributed generation (DG) can raise renewable utilization and improve distribution-network (DN) efficiency, yet their variability and the siting-dependent charging demand can overload feeders if placed poorly. This paper proposes a tri-level, two-stage stochastic-robust optimization (SRO) co-planning framework that jointly determines RCS siting and DN expansion while accounting for transportation flows and population density. The model distinguishes two uncertainty classes: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), under which EV charging loads vary with RCS siting; and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty (DIU), under which load fluctuations and renewable-generation variability do not depend on the RCS locations or the DN topology. At the upper level, the framework selects RCS sites and DN expansions. At the middle level, EV routing and charging are dispatched given the RCS siting to produce charging loads DDU. At the lower level, DN operation minimizes annualized loss costs under the worst-case DIU, reformulated via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. To solve the resulting problem efficiently, we develop an adaptive inexact column-and-constraint generation (A-iC&CG) algorithm and prove finite-iteration convergence. Case studies on a 47-node DN coupled with a 68-hub transportation network in Shenzhen, China, show that A-iC&CG outperforms benchmark algorithms and that PV-EV hybrid stations are cost-optimal, with RCS siting concentrated near substations and high-flow hubs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William A Wheeler, Samuel Chevalier, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Electrification of residential heating and transporta- tion has the potential to overload transformers in distribution feeders. Strategic scheduling of transformer upgrades to antici- pate increasing loads can avoid operational failures and reduce the risk of supply shortages. This work proposes a framework to prioritize transformer upgrades based on predicted loads at each meter, including heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers. The framework follows a Monte Carlo approach to forecasting, generating many possible loading instances and collecting a distribution of failure probabilities for each transformer. In each loading instance, heat pumps and EVs are added stochastically to each meter over time, based on an overall estimated growth rate and factors specific to each customer. We set heat pump load profiles by temperature and EV load profiles based on a stochastic driving model and charging pattern. The load profiles feed into network topology and transformer failure models to calculate failure this http URL formulate a cost optimization based on these failure probabilities to schedule transformer upgrades. We demonstrate this approach on a real-world distribution feeder in rural Vermont under low, medium, and high-electrification scenarios. We find generally less than 20% of transformers having substantial risk of failure over a 20-year simulation. Lastly, we develop an optimization routine to schedule upgrades and discuss the expected number of failures.</p>

            <h2>Targeted Algorithmic Purpose-Driven Cyber Attacks in Distributed Multi-Agent Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahan FakouriFard, Mingxi Liu</p>
            <p>Distributed multi-agent optimization (DMAO) enables the scalable control and coordination of a large population of edge resources in complex multi-agent environments. Despite its great scalability, DMAO is prone to cyber attacks as it relies on frequent peer-to-peer communications that are vulnerable to malicious data injection and alteration. Existing cybersecurity research mainly focuses on \emph{broad-spectrum} attacks that aim to jeopardize the overall environment but fail to sustainably achieve specific or targeted objectives. This paper develops a class of novel strategic purpose-driven algorithmic attacks that are launched by participating agents and interface with DMAO to achieve self-interested attacking purposes. Theoretical foundations, in both primal and dual senses, are established for these attack vectors with and without stealthy features. Simulations on electric vehicle charging control validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithmic attacks and show the impacts of such attacks on the power distribution network.</p>

            <h2>Data-Driven EV Charging Load Profile Estimation and Typical EV Daily Load Dataset Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linhan Fang, Jesus Silva-Rodriguez, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption introduces new challenges for distribution grids due to large, localized load increases, stochastic charging behavior, and limited data availability. This paper proposes two data-driven methods to estimate residential EV charging profiles using real-world customer meter data from CenterPoint Energy serving the Houston area. The first approach applies a least-squares estimation to extract average charging rates by comparing aggregated EV and non-EV meter data, enabling a statistical method for starting and ending charge times. The second method isolates EV load from meter profiles and applies a kernel density estimation (KDE) to develop a probabilistic charging model. Both methods produce a distinct "u-shaped" daily charging profile, with most charging occurring overnight. The validated profiles offer a scalable tool for utilities to better anticipate EV-driven demand increases and support proactive grid planning.</p>

            <h2>A congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism for regions allowing passive balancing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Thanh Nguyen, Bart Van Der Holst, Phuong Hong Nguyen, Koen Kok</p>
            <p>Maintaining system balance becomes increasingly challenging as market design and grid capacity enhancement lag behind the growing share of renewables, requiring greater effort from both the transmission system operator (TSO) and the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs). An actor can support balancing actively by bidding into reserve markets, or passively by adjusting its portfolio in line with system needs. In some countries, BRPs are incentivized to engage in passive balancing when their deviations support overall system stability. However, BRPs focus on profit maximization rather than minimizing portfolio discrepancies, which can cause simultaneous responses to price signals and create issues at the transmission-distribution interface. This research provides a two-stage stochastic model that captures BRP dynamic behavior and their impact on the grid under day-ahead and balancing market price uncertainty across three imbalance pricing mechanisms: the single, dual, and two-price. Then, a congestion-dependent imbalance pricing mechanism is proposed that maintains incentives for passive balancing while satisfying the grid constraint. A proof of concept is provided via the simulation with a part of the Dutch distribution grid. Results show that the proposed method mitigates the unexpected peak flow issue in congested areas while preserving passive balancing contributions from other BRPs in non-congested areas.</p>

            <h2>On the Impact of Voltage Unbalance on Distribution Locational Marginal Prices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Zabihi, Luis Badesa, Araceli Hernandez</p>
            <p>Finding clear economic signals for distribution-network operation and expansion is increasingly important as single-phase loads and distributed energy resources escalate. These devices create phase-to-phase imbalances that manifest as voltage unbalance, a power quality issue that accelerates insulation aging in machines and increases network losses, thereby raising costs for operators and consumers. Traditional grid codes address unbalance via disparate hard limits on various indices thresholds that differ across standards, offer no dynamic economic incentive and undermine optimality. This paper proposes instead to treat voltage unbalance as a `soft limit' by adding penalty terms to grid operation costs within a three-phase optimal power flow to reflect the cost of the decrease in lifetime of assets due to being subject to voltage unbalance. This unified approach yields dynamic economic signals unbalance-aware Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMP) that reflect the cost of power quality deviations. A novel mathematical decomposition of DLMP is developed, isolating the energy, loss, congestion, and unbalance components. Case studies conducted on two benchmark networks demonstrate the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method. The results indicate that unbalance penalties reshape nodal prices, produce unexpected phase-level effects, and even allow scenarios where added load reduces unbalance and lowers costs, while providing planners and market designers with actionable insights to balance investment, operation, and power quality in modern distribution systems.</p>

            <h2>Data Center Control Against Sub-Synchronous Resonance: A Data-Driven Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grant Ruan, Marija D. Ilic, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Discounting in Deterministic Black Box Price Predictions for Energy Arbitrage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Bhattacharjee</p>
            <p>This study examines the economic impact of post-hoc uncertainty discounting in predictive energy management, specifically in battery energy arbitrage. A 2.2 MWh, 1.1 MW Tesla battery, emulating operations at the University of Queensland's St. Lucia campus, is used as a test system. Traditionally, Model Predictive Control (MPC) frameworks rely on deterministic spot price forecasts from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to optimize battery scheduling. However, these forecasts lack uncertainty awareness, making arbitrage strategies vulnerable to extreme price volatility. To address this, we propose simple heuristic uncertainty discounting methods, which require no access to the predictive model's architecture or inputs. By integrating these strategies into existing MPC frameworks, we demonstrate a more than 20% improvement in economic returns under identical operational constraints. This approach enhances decision-making in energy arbitrage while remaining practical, scalable, and independent of specific forecasting models</p>

            <p>This work presents a case study of optimal energy management of a large Heating Ventilation and Cooling (HVAC) system within a university campus in Australia using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The HVAC system supplies to nine university buildings with an annual average electricity consumption of $\sim2$ GWh. Updated chiller Coefficient of Performance (COP) curves are identified, and a predictive building cooling demand model is developed using historical data from the HVAC system. Based on these inputs, a Proximal Policy Optimization based RL model is trained to optimally schedule the chillers in a receding horizon control framework with a priority reward function for constraint satisfaction. Compared to the traditional way of controlling the HVAC system based on a reactive rule-based method, the proposed controller saves up to 28\% of the electricity consumed by simply controlling the mass flow rates of the chiller banks and with minimal constraint violations.</p>

            <h2>Offset-free Data-Driven Predictive Control for Grid-Connected Power Converters in Weak Grid Faults</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivo Kraayeveld, Thomas de Jong, Mircea Lazar</p>
            <p>Grid-connected power converters encounter significant stability challenges during weak grid faults, when conventional PI-based controllers exhibit an oscillatory response and poor fault-ride-through performance. This paper addresses this problem by replacing the conventional outer PI controllers that regulate DC-link and PCC voltages with an offset-free data-driven predictive controller. The developed algorithm leverages either pre-fault or fault-time data to construct input-output predictors, yielding offset-free control without the need for physics-based modelling. Simulation results show that pre-fault offset-free DPC doubles the critical equivalent grid impedance that can be handled and reduces the root mean squared error during faults by a factor of 40, while maintaining computation times comparable to conventional PI control. These findings demonstrate that the developed offset-free data predictive controller offers a simple, robust, and computationally efficient alternative to conventional control, significantly enhancing fault-ride-through capabilities of converters in weak grids.</p>

            <p>Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</p>

            <h2>Towards AC Feasibility of DCOPF Dispatch</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael A. Boateng, Russell Bent, Sidhant Misra, Parikshit Pareek, Pascal Van Hentenryck, Daniel Molzahn</p>
            <p>DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) is widely utilized in power system operations due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its lossless, reactive power-agnostic model often yields dispatches that are infeasible under practical operating scenarios such as the nonlinear AC power flow (ACPF) equations. While theoretical analysis demonstrates that DCOPF solutions are inherently AC-infeasible, their widespread industry adoption suggests substantial practical utility. This paper develops a unified DCOPF-ACPF pipeline to recover AC feasible solutions from DCOPF-based dispatches. The pipeline uses four DCOPF variants and applies AC feasibility recovery using both distributed slack allocation and PV/PQ switching. The main objective is to identify the most effective pipeline for restoring AC feasibility. Evaluation across over 10,000 dispatch scenarios on various test cases demonstrates that the structured ACPF model yields solutions that satisfy both the ACPF equations, and all engineering inequality constraints. In a 13,659 bus case, the mean absolute error and cost differences between DCOPF and ACOPF are reduced by 75% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional single slack bus methods. Under extreme loading conditions, the pipeline reduces inequality constraint violations by a factor of 3 to 5.</p>

            <h2>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HyunJoong Kim, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</p>

            <h2>Strategic Data Center Load Shifting: Implications for Market Efficiency and Transmission Value</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aron Brenner, Line Roald, Saurabh Amin</p>
            <p>Data center electricity use may reach 12% of U.S. demand by 2030, alongside growing ability to shift workloads geographically in response to prices or carbon signals. We examine the system-level implications of such strategic flexibility using a bilevel two-zone model that couples economic dispatch with consumer cost minimization. Two market failures emerge. First, discontinuous price changes at generator capacity limits can induce flexible consumers to shift load in socially inefficient directions-for example, toward a higher-cost region to trigger a price drop elsewhere. Second, by positioning near capacity boundaries, consumers can eliminate the marginal value of transmission expansion: although shadow prices suggest additional capacity is valuable, consumers reoptimize to offset resulting flow changes, leaving dispatch and costs unchanged. We derive conditions under which these effects arise and show that conventional price signals and planning methods can misrepresent system value in the presence of large flexible loads.</p>

To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs). Unlike existing methods that treat control synthesis and topology design separately, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously optimizes both aspects to achieve voltage and frequency regulation and proportional power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). We formulate the closed-loop AC MG as a networked system where DGs, distribution lines, and loads are interconnected subsystems characterized by their dissipative properties. Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.</p>

            <p>Beamforming with desired directivity patterns using compact microphone arrays is essential in many audio applications. Directivity patterns achievable using traditional beamformers depend on the number of microphones and the array aperture. Generally, their effectiveness degrades for compact arrays. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural directional filtering (NDF) approach that leverages deep neural networks to enable sound capture with a predefined directivity pattern. The NDF computes a single-channel complex mask from the microphone array signals, which is then applied to a reference microphone to produce an output that approximates a virtual directional microphone with the desired directivity pattern. We introduce training strategies and propose data-dependent metrics to evaluate the directivity pattern and directivity factor. We show that the proposed method: i) achieves a frequency-invariant directivity pattern even above the spatial aliasing frequency, ii) can approximate diverse and higher-order patterns, iii) can steer the pattern in different directions, and iv) generalizes to unseen conditions. Lastly, experimental comparisons demonstrate superior performance over conventional beamforming and parametric approaches.</p>

            <p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL objective. This is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of energy storage systems (ESSs) into power grids has necessitated effective real-time control strategies under uncertain and volatile electricity prices. An important problem of model predictive control of ESSs is identifying the minimum forecast horizon needed to exactly simulate the globally optimal control trajectory. Existing methods in the literature provide only sufficient conditions and might ignore real-world inconsistencies in control actions. In this paper, we introduce a trajectory-alignment-based definition of the minimum forecast horizon and propose an algorithm that identifies the minimum planning horizon for which all rolling-horizon control decisions match those of the full-horizon global optimization. Using real price data from the bidding zone DK1 in Denmark of the Nord Pool day-ahead market and a realistic ESS model, we illustrate that $60$ hours of forecast horizon allows us to exactly simulate the global control sequence and economic outcomes. In addition, we illustrate that under other parameter configurations, no forecast horizon ensures full convergence, demonstrating the sensitivity of the existence of a forecast horizon to various parameters. Our findings provide an operationally significant framework for minimum forecast horizon detection in storage scheduling and pave the way for the analytical description of this important planning measure.</p>

            <p>In the day-ahead energy market, the offering strategy of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators must be submitted before the uncertainty realization in the form of price-quantity pairs. This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage robust adaptive stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions and is up to 100 times faster than Gurobi and 33 times faster than classical column-and-constraint generation on the same 1028-node synthetic distribution network.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Nadeem, MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha</p>
            <p>As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, accurately modeling power grid dynamics is becoming increasingly more complex. Concurrently, data acquisition and realtime system state monitoring are becoming more available for control centers. This motivates shifting from \textit{model- and Lyapunov-based} feedback controller designs toward \textit{model-free} ones. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key tool for designing model-free controllers. Various studies have been carried out to study voltage/frequency control strategies via RL. However, usually a simplified system model is used neglecting detailed dynamics of solar, wind, and composite loads -- and damping system-wide oscillations and modeling power flows are all usually ignored. To that end, we pose an optimal feedback control problem for a detailed renewables-heavy power system, defined by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (NDAE). The control problem is solved using a completely model-free design via RL as well as using a model-based approach built upon the Lyapunov stability theory with guarantees. The paper in its essence seeks to explore whether data-driven feedback control should be used in power grids over its model-driven counterpart. Theoretical developments and thorough case studies are presented with an eye on this exploration. Finally, a detailed analysis is provided to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches for renewables-heavy grids.</p>

            <p>Constructing clean and low-carbon rural integrated energy system (RIES) is a fundamental requirement for supporting China's rural modernization and new-type urbanization. Existing research on RIES decarbonization primarily focuses on the optimal low-carbon operation of system-level energy devices at the macro level, while the synergistic carbon-reduction effects of demand-side flexible loads and external carbon trading mechanisms have not been fully explored. Meanwhile, at the micro level, the carbon sensitivity of device parameters and their potential contribution to emission reduction remain insufficiently investigated. To address these gaps, this study integrates macro- and micro-level analyses. At the macro level, a multi-energy-coupled low-carbon optimal operation framework is developed, incorporating coordinated electric-thermal demand response (DR) and carbon trading. At the micro level, a carbon emission model for RIES components is established, and sensitivity analysis is conducted on 28 carbon-related parameters to identify highly sensitive determinants of emission reduction. Case studies based on typical operation data from a rural region in northern China demonstrate that coordinated electric-thermal DR and carbon trading can achieve maximum carbon-reduction potential. Furthermore, the identified high-sensitivity parameters provide essential theoretical guidance for enhancing the decarbonization potential of RIES.</p>

The limited flight time problem has led to intensive research into new sources of power and innovative charging strategies to enable protracted, autonomous flight. This paper gives a comparative summary of the current state-of-the-art in UAV power and refuelling technology. The paper begins with an analysis of the variety of energy sources, from classical batteries to fuel cells and hybrid systems, based on their relative advantages and disadvantages in energy density, weight, and safety. Subsequently, the review explores a spectrum of replenishment options, from simple manual battery swapping to sophisticated high-tech automatic docking stations and smart contact-based charging pads. Most of the review is dedicated to the newer technology of wireless power transfer, which involves near-field (inductive, capacitive) and far-field (laser, microwave) technology. The article also delves into the most important power electronic converter topologies, battery management systems, and control approaches that form the core of these charging systems. Finally, it recapitulates the most significant challenges in technical, economic, and social aspects for promising avenues of future research. The comprehensive review is a valuable guide for researchers, engineers, and policymakers striving to enhance UAV operational performance.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous Sensing UAV for Accurate Multi-User Identification and Localization in Cellular Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niccolò Paglierani, Francesco Linsalata, Vineeth Teeda, Davide Scazzoli, Maurizio Magarini</p>
            <p>This paper presents an autonomous sensing frame- work for identifying and localizing multiple users in Fifth Generation (5G) networks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is not part of the serving access network. Unlike conventional aerial serving nodes, the proposed UAV operates passively and is dedicated solely to sensing. It captures Uplink (UL) Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), and requires virtually no coordination with the network infrastructure. A complete signal processing chain is proposed and developed, encompassing synchronization, user identification, and localization, all executed onboard UAV during flight. The system autonomously plans and adapts its mission workflow to estimate multiple user positions within a single deployment, integrating flight control with real-time sensing. Extensive simulations and a full-scale low- altitude experimental campaign validate the approach, showing localization errors below 3 m in rural field tests and below 8 m in urban simulation scenarios, while reliably identifying each user. The results confirm the feasibility of infrastructure-independent sensing UAVs as a core element of the emerging Low Altitude Economy (LAE), supporting situational awareness and rapid deployment in emergency or connectivity-limited environments.</p>

            <h2>The Liquid Buffer: Multi-Year Storage for Defossilization and Energy Security under Climate Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonard Göke, Jan Wohland, Stefano Moret, André Bardow</p>
            <p>The climate-driven uncertainty of renewable generation and electricity demand challenges energy security in net-zero energy systems. By introducing a scalable stochastic model that implicitly accounts for 51'840 climate years, this paper identifies multi-year storage of liquid hydrocarbons as a key option for managing climate uncertainty and ensuring energy security. In Europe, multi-year storage reduces system costs by 4.1%, fossil imports by 86%, and curtailment by 60%. The benefit of multi-year storage is that a renewable surplus in one year is not curtailed but converted to synthetic oil, with hydrogen as an intermediate product, and stored to balance a future deficit. We find that the required energy capacity for liquid hydrocarbons is 525 TWh, a quarter of the European Union's current oil and gas reserves, complemented by 116 TWh for hydrogen storage. Security of supply remains high and unserved energy only amounts to 0.0035 per thousand, well below the common target of 0.02 per thousand.</p>

            <h2>Joint Transmit Beamforming and Reflection Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS Aided Multi-Cell MIMO Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Zheng, Shuowen Zhang</p>
            <p>The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will rely on ultra-dense multi-cell deployment to meet the high rate and connectivity demands. However, frequency reuse leads to severe inter-cell interference, particularly for cell-edge users, which limits the communication performance. To overcome this challenge, we investigate a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multi-cell multi-user downlink MIMO communication system, where a BD-RIS is deployed to enhance desired signals and suppress both intra-cell and inter-cell this http URL formulate the joint optimization problem of the transmit beamforming matrices at the BSs and the BD-RIS reflection matrix to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users, subject to the challenging unitary constraint of the BD-RIS reflection matrix and transmit power constraints at the BSs. To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amélie Canin, Cédric Févotte, Nicolas Dobigeon, Dries Van De Putte, Takashi Onaka, Olivier Berné</p>
            <p>MIRI is the imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from $4.9$ to $27.9$ $\mu$m onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.</p>

            <h2>A Practical Validation of RIS Detection and Identification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Recep Vural, Aymen Khaleel, Ertugrul Basar</p>
            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.</p>

            <h2>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> HyunJoong Kim, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</p>

            <h2>3D Cooperative User Tracking for Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingjie Xu, Xuesong Cai, Michiel Sandra, Sara Willhammar, Fredrik Tufvesson</p>
            <p>As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) becomes an integral part of 6G networks, distributed ISAC (DISAC) is expected to enhance both sensing and communication performance through its decentralized architecture. This paper presents a complete framework to address the challenge of cooperative user tracking in DISAC systems. By incorporating a global probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and a field-of-view-aware access point (AP) management strategy, the framework enables accurate user tracking using radio signals while optimizing AP scheduling. In addition, a real-world distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. The results demonstrate that a centimeter-level root mean-square trajectory error can be achieved. Furthermore, the results show that it is not necessary to keep APs active at all times to maintain high tracking accuracy, indicating the need for robust and efficient AP management. These findings provide valuable insights into practical deployments and the further development of cooperative user tracking techniques in DISAC systems.</p>

            <p>Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.</p>

            <h2>Translation-Symmetric Market: Enabling Incentive Compatibility For DER Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruike Lyu, Chuyi Li, Kedi Zheng, Mengshu Shi, Hongye Guo, Chongqing Kang</p>
            <p>Virtual power plants (VPPs) are indispensable for coordinating the rapidly growing portfolios of distributed energy resources (DERs) and enabling them to deliver multiple services into higher-level electricity markets. However, the profit allocation procedures that govern VPP participants become increasingly challenging to keep incentive-compatible due to the enlarged DER market power within each VPP, compared to directly bidding into the wholesale market. In this paper, we formulate both the VPP's market participation and its internal operation and profit allocation as consistent market-clearing processes. Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.</p>

            <p>Prognostics and Health Management is crucial for the reliability and lifetime assessment of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps. This work, therefore, intends to map the further development of Prognostics and Health Management systems toward ensuring the viability of PEFCs in practical applications.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we propose a novel blockage-aware hierarchical beamforming framework for movable antenna (MA) systems operating at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies. While existing works on MA systems have demonstrated performance gains over conventional systems, they often neglect the design of specialized codebooks to leverage MA's unique capabilities and address the challenges of increased energy consumption and latency inherent to MA systems. To address these aspects, we first integrate blockage detection into the codebook design process based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, significantly reducing inefficiencies due to beam evaluations done in blocked directions. Then, we use a two-stage approach to reduce the complexity of the joint beamforming and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) optimization problem. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed adaptive codebook successfully improves the Energy Efficiency (EE) and reduces the beam training overhead, substantially boosting the practical deployment potential of RIS-assisted MA systems in future wireless networks.</p>

            <p>The rapid development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks requires seamless integration of communication and sensing to support ubiquitous intelligence and real-time, high-reliability applications. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key solution for achieving this convergence, offering joint utilization of spectral, hardware, and computing resources. However, realizing high-performance ISAC remains challenging due to environmental line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, limited spatial resolution, and the inherent coverage asymmetry and resource coupling between sensing and communication. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), featuring low-cost, energy-efficient, and programmable electromagnetic reconfiguration, provide a promising solution to overcome these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive overview of IRS-aided wireless sensing and ISAC technologies, including IRS architectures, target detection and estimation techniques, beamforming designs, and performance metrics. It further explores IRS-enabled new opportunities for more efficient performance balancing, coexistence, and networking in ISAC systems, focuses on current design bottlenecks, and outlines future research directions. This article aims to offer a unified design framework that guides the development of practical and scalable IRS-aided ISAC systems for the next-generation wireless network.</p>

            <p>Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) has emerged as a key architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling cooperative transmission across spatially distributed access points (APs). However, most existing studies rely on idealized channel models and lack hardware validation, leaving a gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment. Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven precoding have shown strong potential for learning nonlinear channel-to-precoder mappings, but their real-world deployment remains limited due to challenges in data collection and model generalization. This work presents a framework for implementing and validating an AI-based precoder on a D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration. A pre-trained graph neural network (GNN)-based model is fine-tuned using real-world channel state information (CSI) collected from the Techtile platform and evaluated under both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios before end-to-end validation. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.7% performance gain over the pre-trained model in the multi-user case after fine-tuning, while in the single-user scenario the model achieves near-maximum ratio transmission (MRT) performance with less than 0.7 bits/channel use degradation out of a total throughput of 5.19 bits/channel use on unseen positions. Further analysis confirms the data efficiency of real-world measurements, showing consistent gains with increasing training samples, and end-to-end validation verifies coherent power focusing comparable to MRT.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianxin Song, Xianghao Yu, Jie Xu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng</p>
            <p>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a disruptive technology enabling future sixth-generation (6G) networks. This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance.</p>

            <h2>Graph Learning for Cooperative Cell-Free ISAC Systems: From Optimization to Estimation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Jiang, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu</p>
            <p>Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous high-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through cooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these capabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization with multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph learning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network as a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user association, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position and velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous graph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight mirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph learning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms integrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), enabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments. Conversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational complexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with share adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed graph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in multi-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional heuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT framework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and signaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.</p>

            <p>The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of continued growth in solar photovoltaics are closely tied to siting decisions. But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Hanifi, Sasan Jafarnejad, Marc Köntges, Andrej Wentnagel, Andreas Kokkas, Raphael Frank</p>
            <p>Reliable anomaly detection in photovoltaic (PV) modules is critical for maintaining solar energy efficiency. However, developing robust computer vision models for PV inspection is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and balanced datasets. This study introduces PV-DDPM, a spatially conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates anomalous electroluminescence (EL) images across four PV cell types: multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si), mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si), half-cut multi-c-Si, and interdigitated back contact (IBC) with dogbone interconnect. PV-DDPM enables controlled synthesis of single-defect and multi-defect scenarios by conditioning on binary masks representing structural features and defect positions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that jointly models multiple PV cell types while supporting simultaneous generation of diverse anomaly types. We also introduce E-SCDD, an enhanced version of the SCDD dataset, comprising 1,000 pixel-wise annotated EL images spanning 30 semantic classes, and 1,768 unlabeled synthetic samples. Quantitative evaluation shows our generated images achieve a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 4.10 and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) of 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0007 across all categories. Training the vision--language anomaly detection model AA-CLIP on E-SCDD, compared to the SCDD dataset, improves pixel-level AUC and average precision by 1.70 and 8.34 points, respectively.</p>

Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation.

            <p>This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.</p>

            <p>The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</p>

            <h2>Large-Signal Stability Guarantees for a Scalable DC Microgrid with Nonlinear Distributed Control: The Slow Communication Scenario</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cornelia Skaga, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Hence, this study explores large-signal stability guarantees of a promising distributed control framework for cyber-physical DC microgrids, ensuring proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. The proposed control framework adopts nonlinear nested control loops--inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed)--specifically designed to simultaneously achieve the control objectives. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops. In particular, by saturating the influence of the outer loop controller in the inner loop, the proposed controller preserves a more convenient mathematical structure, facilitating the scalability of the stability proof using Lyapunov arguments. The effectiveness of our proposed control strategy is supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid following a careful tuning strategy, and a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cornelia Skaga, Babak Abdolmaleki, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz</p>
            <p>As renewable energy generation becomes increasingly integrated into electrical grids, there is a critical need for a paradigm shift toward control schemes that ensure safe, stable, and scalable operations. Hence, in this study, we explore the stability guarantees of a promising control proposal for cyber-physical DC microgrids (MGs), specifically designed to simultaneously achieve proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the inner(decentralized) and outer(distributed) nested loops, and thus, ensuring that the system reaches the desired (optimal) steady state under appropriate tuning verifying some stability conditions. To prove the effectiveness of our method, our findings are supported by testing the control method in a time-domain simulation case study involving a low-voltage DC microgrid, as well as a small-signal stability analysis</p>

            <h2>Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maharshi Pathak, SungKu Kang, Vanessa C. Whittem, Katherine Bassett, Michael B. Kane, David J. Fannon</p>
            <p>The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.</p>

            <h2>Incremental DRL-Based Resource Management for Dynamic Network Slicing in an Urban-Wide Testbed</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiyuan Li, Yuelin Liu, Hari Madhukumar, Amin Emami, Xueqing Zhou, Yulei Wu, Xenofon Vasilakos, Shuangyi Yan, Dimitra Simeonidou</p>
            <p>Multi-access edge computing provides localized resources within mobile networks to address the requirements of emerging latency-sensitive and computing-intensive applications. At the edge, dynamic requests necessitate sophisticated resource management for adaptive network slicing. This involves optimizing resource allocations, scaling functions, and load balancing to utilize only essential resources under constrained network scenarios. However, existing solutions largely assume static slice counts, ignoring the re-optimization overhead associated with management algorithms when slices fluctuate. Moreover, many approaches rely on simplified energy models that overlook intertemporal resource scheduling and are predominantly evaluated through simulations, neglecting critical practical considerations. This paper presents an incremental cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for resource management in dynamic edge slicing. The proposed approach optimizes long-term slicing benefits by reducing delay and energy consumption while minimizing retraining overhead in response to slice variations. Furthermore, we implement an urban-wide edge computing testbed based on OpenStack and Kubernetes to validate the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our incremental MADDPG method outperforms benchmark strategies in aggregated slicing utility and reduces training energy consumption by up to 50% compared to the re-optimization approach.</p>

            <h2>Learning-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Based on Measurement Dataset in Railway Environments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Heng Chou, Da-Chih Lin, Hung-Yu Wei, Walid Saad, Yu Tsao</p>
            <p>In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.</p>

            <p>The large-scale integration of renewable energy and power electronic devices has increased the complexity of power system stability, making transient stability assessment more challenging. Conventional methods are limited in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MoE-GraphSAGE, a graph neural network framework based on the MoE for unified TAS and TVS assessment. The framework leverages GraphSAGE to capture the power grid's spatiotemporal topological features and employs multi-expert networks with a gating mechanism to model distinct instability modes jointly. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that MoE-GraphSAGE achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering an effective solution for online multi-task transient stability assessment in complex power systems.</p>

            <h2>Energy-Workload Coupled Migration Optimization Strategy for Virtual Power Plants with Data Centers Considering Fuzzy Chance Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Kai Wu, Zhi-Wei Liu, Yong Zhao, Yan-Wu Wang, Fan-Rong Qu, Chaojie Li</p>
            <p>This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.</p>

            <h2>Bus Type Switching to Reduce Bound Violations in AC Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Van Boven, Kyri Baker</p>
            <p>Wholesale power markets often use linear approximations of power system constraints. Because it does not consider inequality constraints, using AC power flow for feasibility post-processing can violate bounds on reactive power, voltage magnitudes, or thermal limits. There remains a need for a streamlined analytical approach that can guarantee AC feasibility while adhering to variable bounds. This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach. The proposed method sacrifices the voltage setpoint at a generator in exchange for fixing the voltage at a load bus, thereby moving a degree of freedom around the network. Results on the IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus, and 300-bus test cases demonstrate how switching bus types can reduce overall network violations and help find feasible power system setpoints.</p>

            <h2>ADMM Penalty Parameter Evaluation for Networked Microgrid Energy Management</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesus Silva-Rodriguez, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful algorithm for solving decentralized optimization problems including networked microgrid energy management (NetMEM). However, its performance is highly sensitive to the selection of its penalty parameter \r{ho}, which can lead to slow convergence, suboptimal solutions, or even algorithm divergence. This paper evaluates and compares three district ADMM formulations to solve the NetMEM problem, which explore different methods to determine appropriate stopping points, aiming to yield high-quality solutions. Furthermore, an adaptive penalty heuristic is also incorporated into each method to analyze its potential impact on ADMM performance. Different case studies on networks of varying sizes demonstrate that an objective-based ADMM approach, denominated as OB-ADMM, is significantly more robust to the choice of \r{ho}, consistently yielding solutions closer to the centralized optimal benchmark by preventing premature algorithm stopping.</p>

            <h2>Grid Operational Benefit Analysis of Data Center Spatial Flexibility: Congestion Relief, Renewable Energy Curtailment Reduction, and Cost Saving</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoxiang Wan, Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>Data centers are facilities housing computing infrastructure for processing and storing digital information. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization.</p>

            <p>This paper addresses the power control design for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system that performs integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case where many access points are deployed to simultaneously communicate with mobile users and monitor the surrounding environment at the same time-frequency slot is considered. On top of the user-centric architecture used for the data services, a target-centric approach is introduced for the detection tasks. As a valuable performance metric, we derive the receive sensing signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio under generalized likelihood ratio test processing. Based on that, we formulate a quality-of-service (QoS) scheme that maximizes the two figures of merit: achievable data rate and effective sensing SNR. Simulations demonstrate that our proposal surpasses orthogonal resource algorithms, underscoring the potential of ISAC-enabled CF-mMIMO networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iva Radecic, Bozidar Filipovic-Grcic, Paul Akiki, Alain Xemard, Bruno Jurisic</p>
            <p>HVDC networks offer several advantages over traditional HVAC systems, particularly for long-distance power transmission and integration of renewable energy sources, such as reduced losses and enhanced stability and control, but also increase the risk of oscillations. This study investigates electrical resonant phenomena associated with HVDC stations through numerical EMT simulations. The findings indicate that electrical resonance is primarily pronounced in weak networks with long cables, as confirmed by the Nyquist criterion applied to frequency responses. Two real cases were successfully simulated in the time domain by introducing network changes, such as temporary faults and alterations in network's power strength, to activate the identified resonances. Notably, in a strong network with short cables, electrical resonance occurred alongside interactions between the network and the converter's protection system. The analysis of voltage waveforms revealed that the amplitude of the induced resonant harmonic dissipates quickly, indicating sufficient damping in the network configuration. Furthermore, the study confirmed the network's sensitivity to changes in converter parameters modeled using available MMC model.</p>

            <h2>Resilience-oriented Planning and Cost Allocation of Energy Storage Integrated with Soft Open Point Based on Resilience Insurance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingkai Huang, Yuxiong Huang, Qianwen Hu, Gengfeng Li, Zhaohong Bie</p>
            <p>In recent years, frequent extreme events have put forward higher requirements for improving the resilience of distribution networks (DNs). Introducing energy storage integrated with soft open point (E-SOP) is one of the effective ways to improve resilience. However, the widespread application of E-SOP is limited by its high investment cost. Based on this, we propose a cost allocation framework and optimal planning method of E-SOP in resilient DN. Firstly, a cost allocation mechanism for E-SOP based on resilience insurance service is designed; the probability of power users purchasing resilience insurance service is determined based on the expected utility theory. Then, a four-layer stochastic distributionally robust optimization (SDRO) model is developed for E-SOP planning and insurance pricing strategy, where the uncertainty in the intensity of contingent extreme events is addressed by a stochastic optimization approach, while the uncertainty in the occurrence of outages and resilience insurance purchases resulting from a specific extreme event is addressed via a distributionally robust optimization approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on the modified IEEE 33-bus DN.</p>

            <p>This paper tackles the problem of designing proper uplink multiple access schemes for coexistence between enhanced mobile broadband+ (eMBB+) users and massive machine-type communications+ (mMTC+) devices in a terminal-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Specifically, the use of a time-frequency spreading technique for the mMTC+ devices has been proposed. Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Yuan, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li</p>
            <p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swadesh Vhakta, Denis Osipov, Reetam Sen Biswas, Amritanshu Pandey, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage frequency instability risks from a steady-state perspective, without the need for derivative-dependent transient modeling. Specifically, we jointly address two questions (Q1) Survivability: following a disturbance and the subsequent primary frequency response, can the system settle into a healthy steady state (feasible with an acceptable frequency deviation $\Delta f$)? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: if found unstable, what critical vulnerabilities create instability and/or full collapse? To address these questions, we first augment steady-state power flow states to include frequency-dependent governor relationships (i.e., governor power flow). Afterwards, we propose a frequency-aware sparse optimization that finds the minimal set of bus locations with measurable compensations (corrective actions) to enforce power balance and maintain frequency within predefined/acceptable bounds. We evaluate our method on standard transmission systems to empirically validate its ability to localize dominant sources of vulnerabilities. For a 1354-bus large system, our method detects compensations to only four buses under N-1 generation outage (3424.8 MW) while enforcing a maximum allowable steady-state frequency drop of 0.06 Hz (otherwise, frequency drops by nearly 0.08 Hz). We further validate the scalability of our method, requiring less than four minutes to obtain sparse solutions for the 1354-bus system.</p>

            <p>Power system time series analytics is critical in understanding the system operation conditions and predicting the future trends. Despite the wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, many AI-based time series analytical models suffer from task-specificity (i.e. one model for one task) and structural rigidity (i.e. the input-output format is fixed), leading to limited model performances and resource wastes. In this paper, we propose a Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model (CM-LLM) that can solve heterogeneous power system time-series analysis tasks. First, we introduce a physics-statistics combined causal discovery mechanism to capture the causal relationship, which is represented by graph, among power system variables. Second, we propose a multimodal data preprocessing framework that can encode and fuse text, graph and time series to enhance the model performance. Last, we formulate a generic "mask-and-reconstruct" paradigm and design a dynamic input-output padding mechanism to enable CM-LLM adaptive to heterogeneous time-series analysis tasks with varying sample lengths. Simulation results based on open-source LLM Qwen and real-world dataset demonstrate that, after simple fine-tuning, the proposed CM-LLM can achieve satisfying accuracy and efficiency on three heterogeneous time-series analytics tasks: missing data imputation, forecasting and super resolution.</p>

            <p>Aluminium is manufactured through the Hall-Héroult process, which is very energy intensive. Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed. The results yield insight into the optimal line current and ACD profiles for different power modulation scenarios including the time of use electricity tariff and spot price. These results can form the foundation for further studies into online control policies of aluminium reduction cells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Zhan, Miao Han, Yayao Zhang, Hongsheng Xu, Jiabing Hu, Shijie Cheng, Jürgen Kurths</p>
            <p>The change of electric power generation - from synchronous generator (SG) to converter - is generally regarded as the second revolution of power system. Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%. This elegant nonlinear-dynamics-based approach establishes a unified theory including modelling and analysis for the RDPS transient dynamics.</p>

            <p>This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model matching control-based approach to the problem of power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) interfacing. The objective is to interconnect a grid simulation and a physical device via an interface in a way that is stable and accurate. Conventional approaches include the ideal transformer method (ITM) and its impedance-based variants, which trade accuracy for stability, as well as some $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control-based approaches, which do not make use of all the available information in their optimization for accuracy. Designing for transparency, as opposed to accuracy as existing approaches do, would achieve both accuracy and stability, while making use of all the dynamical information present in the idealized interconnection of the grid and device. The approach proposed in this paper employs model matching to formulate the PHIL problem as an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control problem using transparency as the explicit frequency-domain control objective. The approach is experimentally validated in a real-time resistive-load PHIL setup, and is found to achieve accuracy levels that are comparable or superior to those of an ITM-based interface.</p>

            <h2>Active Short Circuit and Safe Discharge Mechanisms in Multi-Phase Inverters During Critical Failures</h2>

            <p>The multi-phase inverter has become more complicated, particularly in an Electric Vehicle (EV)'s power train, which requires a robust fault protection system. The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.</p>

            <p>In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Downlink-Uplink Spectrum Sharing between Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Mukherjee, Bho Matthiesen, Armin Dekorsy, Petar Popovski</p>
            <p>6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.</p>

Based on early experimental and theoretical investigations, we highlight the potential of ERAs to improve communication performance, sensing capabilities, and energy efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. We further identify critical signal processing challenges and promising research opportunities, offering guidance for future studies on ERA-enabled 6G communications.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous and Distributed Synchronization and Restoration of an Islanded Network of Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Saad Al-Karsani, Maryam Khanbaghi</p>
            <p>The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) are leading to the formation of Microgrids (MGs) and Network of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode, which requires Grid-Forming (GFM) IBRs that can perform black start, synchronization, restoration and regulation. However, such IBRs face synchronization instability issues, which might be worsened by inadequate secondary level frequency and voltage regulation. Accordingly, we propose an autonomous and distributed synchronization and restoration scheme using Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control. To validate the proposed method, we model and simulate a high-fidelity islanded and modified IEEE 123 bus system, modeled as an NMG consisting of 7 MGs. The simulation results demonstrate an effective autonomous soft-start, synchronization, connection and regulation procedure using DAPI control and distributed breaker operation logic.</p>

            <h2>Policy Gradient-Based EMT-in-the-Loop Learning to Mitigate Sub-Synchronous Control Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Mukherjee, Ramij R. Hossain, Kaustav Chatterjee, Sameer Nekkalapu, Marcelo Elizondo</p>
            <p>This paper explores the development of learning-based tunable control gains using EMT-in-the-loop simulation framework (e.g., PSCAD interfaced with Python-based learning modules) to address critical sub-synchronous oscillations. Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.</p>

            <h2>A Multi-Criterion Approach to Smart EV Charging with CO2 Emissions and Cost Minimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Ambrosino, Khai Manh Nguyen, Minh Binh Vu, Riadh Zorgati, Laurent El Ghaoui, Giuseppe C. Calafiore</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a novel three-step framework for smart electric vehicle (EV) charging that jointly minimizes charging costs and CO2 emissions. Drawing inspiration from the classical Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), we first design a linear model to determine the optimal power generation mix over a 24-hour horizon, using real-world data from Vietnam, a country with a highly carbon intensive energy system. This allows us to estimate time-varying CO2 emissions and translate them into an emission cost signal. We then incorporate this environmental cost into a smart charging optimization model, formulated as a linear program (LP). Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline First-In-First-Served (FIFS) approach, achieving notable reductions in both CO2 emissions and charging costs also compared to another optimization approach. The results demonstrate the potential of this multiobjective optimization framework to support more sustainable and cost-efficient EV charging strategies.</p>

            <h2>Coherency Analysis in Nonlinear Heterogeneous Power Networks: A Blended Dynamics Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixuan Liu, Yingzhu Liu, Pengcheng You</p>
            <p>Power system coherency refers to the phenomenon that machines in a power network exhibit similar frequency responses after disturbances, and is foundational for model reduction and control design. Despite abundant empirical observations, the understanding of coherence in complex power networks remains incomplete where the dynamics could be highly heterogeneous, nonlinear, and increasingly affected by persistent disturbances such as renewable energy fluctuations. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the blended dynamics approach, originally rooted in consensus analysis of multi-agent systems, to develop a novel coherency analysis in power networks. We show that the frequency responses of coherent machines coupled by nonlinear power flow can be approximately represented by the blended dynamics, which is a weighted average of nonlinear heterogeneous nodal dynamics, even under time-varying disturbances. Specifically, by developing novel bounds on the difference between the trajectories of nodal dynamics and the blended dynamics, we identify two key factors -- either high network connectivity or small time-variation rate of disturbances -- that contribute to coherence. They enable the nodal frequencies to rapidly approach the blended-dynamics trajectory from arbitrary initial state. Furthermore, they ensure the frequencies closely follow this trajectory in the long term, even when the system does not settle to an equilibrium. These insights contribute to the understanding of power system coherency and are further supported by simulation results.</p>

            <h2>Partial-Power Flow Controller, Voltage Regulator, and Energy Router for Hybrid AC-DC Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ehsan Asadi, Davood Keshavarzi, Alexander Koehler, Nima Tashakor, Stefan Goetz</p>
            <p>The share of electronically converted power from renewable sources, loads, and storage is continuously growing in the low- and medium-voltage grids. These sources and loads typically rectify the grid AC to DC, e.g., for a DC link, so that a DC grid could eliminate hardware and losses of these conversion stages. However, extended DC grids lack the stabilizing nature of AC impedances so that the voltage is more fragile and power flows may need active control, particularly if redundancy as known from AC, such as rings and meshing, is desired. Furthermore, a DC infrastructure will not replace but will need to interface with the existing AC grid. This paper presents a partial-power energy router architecture that can interface multiple AC and DC lines to enable precise control of voltages and both active as well as reactive power flows. The proposed system uses modular low-voltage high-current series modules supplied through dual active bridges. These modules only need to process a small share of the voltage to control large power flows. The topology reduces component size, cost, energy losses, and reliability more than three times compared to conventional technology. The optional integration of battery energy storage can furthermore eliminate the need for the sum of the power flows of all inputs to be zero at all times. Through dynamic voltage injection relative to the line voltage, the modules effectively balance feeder currents, regulate reactive power, and improve the power factor in AC grids. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop and prototype measurements validate the proposed energy router's performance under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results confirm the series module's functionality in both AC and DC grids as an effective solution for controlling extended grids, including power sharing, voltage, and power quality.</p>

            <h2>Voltage-Regulated Sparse Optimization for Proactive Diagnosis of Voltage Collapses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinghua Ma, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Ming Shi, Jan Drgona, Shimiao Li</p>
            <p>This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage the voltage collapse risks, i.e., the risk of bus voltages violating the safe operational bounds, which can be caused by extreme events and contingencies. We jointly answer two resilience-related research questions: (Q1) Survivability: Upon having an extreme event/contingency, will the system remain feasible with voltage staying within a (preferred) safe range? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: If voltage collapses, what are the dominant sources of system vulnerabilities responsible for the failure? This highlights some key locations worth paying attention to in the planning or decision-making process. To address these questions, we propose a voltage-regulated sparse optimization that finds a minimal set of bus locations along with quantified compensations (corrective actions) that can simultaneously enforce AC network balance and voltage bounds. Results on transmission systems of varying sizes (30-bus to 2383-bus) demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates voltage collapses by compensating at only a few strategically identified nodes, while scaling efficiently to large systems, taking on average less than 4 min for 2000+ bus cases. This work can further serve as a backbone for more comprehensive and actionable decision-making, such as reactive power planning to fix voltage issues.</p>

            <h2>Compressive Sensing Photoacoustic Imaging Receiver with Matrix-Vector-Multiplication SAR ADC</h2>

            <p>Wearable photoacoustic imaging devices hold great promise for continuous health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics. However, the large data volume generated by high-density transducer arrays presents a major challenge for realizing compact and power-efficient wearable systems. This paper presents a photoacoustic imaging receiver (RX) that embeds compressive sensing directly into the hardware to address this bottleneck. The RX integrates 16 AFEs and four matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM) SAR ADCs that perform energy- and area-efficient analog-domain compression. The architecture achieves a 4-8x reduction in output data rate while preserving low-loss full-array information. The MVM SAR ADC executes passive and accurate MVM using user-defined programmable ternary weights. Two signal reconstruction methods are implemented: (1) an optimization approach using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, and (2) a learning-based approach employing implicit neural representation. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, the chip achieves an ADC's SNDR of 57.5 dB at 20.41 MS/s, with an AFE input-referred noise of 3.5 nV/sqrt(Hz). MVM linearity measurements show R^2 > 0.999 across a wide range of weights and input amplitudes. The system is validated through phantom imaging experiments, demonstrating high-fidelity image reconstruction under up to 8x compression. The RX consumes 5.83 mW/channel and supports a general ternary-weighted measurement matrix, offering a compelling solution for next-generation miniaturized, wearable PA imaging systems.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a high-fidelity evaluation framework for machine learning (ML)-based classification of cyber-attacks and physical faults using electromagnetic transient simulations with digital substation emulation at 4.8 kHz. Twelve ML models, including ensemble algorithms and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were trained on labeled time-domain measurements and evaluated in a real-time streaming environment designed for sub-cycle responsiveness. The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage). These findings demonstrate that offline accuracy alone is an unreliable indicator of field readiness and underscore the need for realistic testing and inference pipelines to ensure dependable classification in inverter-based resources (IBR)-rich networks.</p>

            <p>Background and Objective: Colorectal cancer prevention relies on early detection of polyps during colonoscopy. Existing public datasets, such as CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG, provide valuable benchmarks but are limited by small sample sizes, curated image selection, or lack of real-world artifacts. There remains a need for datasets that capture the complexity of clinical practice, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: We introduce a dataset, BUET Polyp Dataset (BPD), of colonoscopy images collected using Olympus 170 and Pen- tax i-Scan series endoscopes under routine clinical conditions. The dataset contains images with corresponding expert-annotated binary masks, reflecting diverse challenges such as motion blur, specular highlights, stool artifacts, blood, and low-light frames. Annotations were manually reviewed by clinical experts to ensure quality. To demonstrate baseline performance, we provide bench- mark results for classification using VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, and for segmentation using UNet variants with VGG16, ResNet34, and InceptionV4 backbones. Results: The dataset comprises 1,288 images with polyps from 164 patients with corresponding ground-truth masks and 1,657 polyp-free images from 31 patients. Benchmarking experiments achieved up to 90.8% accuracy for binary classification (VGG16) and a maximum Dice score of 0.64 with InceptionV4-UNet for segmentation. Performance was lower compared to curated datasets, reflecting the real-world difficulty of images with artifacts and variable quality.</p>

            <h2>Learning stabilising policies for constrained nonlinear systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Ravasio, Danilo Saccani, Marcello Farina, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate</p>
            <p>This work proposes a two-layered control scheme for constrained nonlinear systems represented by a class of recurrent neural networks and affected by additive disturbances. In particular, a base controller ensures global or regional closed-loop l_p-stability of the error in tracking a desired equilibrium and the satisfaction of input and output constraints within a robustly positive invariant set. An additional control contribution, derived by combining the internal model control principle with a stable operator, is introduced to improve system performance. This operator, implemented as a stable neural network, can be trained via unconstrained optimisation on a chosen performance metric, without compromising closed-loop equilibrium tracking or constraint satisfaction, even if the optimisation is stopped prematurely. In addition, we characterise the class of closed-loop stable behaviours that can be achieved with the proposed architecture. Simulation results on a pH-neutralisation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Gokul Krishnan, Mohd Asim Aftab, Shehab Ahmed, Charalambos Konstantinou</p>
            <p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern power systems has intensified the need for resilient and efficient microgrid solutions. DC microgrids have gained prominence due to their reduced conversion losses, simplified interfacing with DC-based RESs, and improved reliability. To manage the inherent variability of RESs and ensure stable operation, energy management systems (EMS) have become essential. While various EMS algorithms have been proposed and validated using real-time simulation platforms, most assume ideal communication conditions or rely on simplified network models, overlooking the impact of realistic communication delays on EMS performance. This paper presents a novel real-time cyber-physical system (CPS) testbed for evaluating EMS performance in DC microgrids under realistic communication delays. The proposed testbed integrates a DC microgrid modeled in OPAL-RT with an EMS controller implemented on a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The communication network is emulated using EXataCPS, enabling the exchange of actual power system traffic and the replication of realistic latency conditions. This comprehensive setup captures the interplay between power system dynamics, EMS control, and communication network behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Turker Takci, James Day, Meysam Qadrdan</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of data centres poses an evolving challenge for power systems with high variable renewable energy. Traditionally operated as passive electrical loads, data centres, have the potential to become active participants that provide flexibility to the grid. However, quantifying and utilising this flexibility have not yet been fully explored. This paper presents an integrated, whole facility optimisation model to investigate the least cost operating schedule of data centres and characterise the aggregate flexibility available from data centres to the power system. The model accounts for IT workload shifting, UPS energy storage, and cooling system. Motivated by the need to alleviate the increasing strain on power systems while leveraging their untapped flexibility potential, this study makes two primary contributions: (i) an operational optimisation model that integrates IT scheduling, UPS operation, and cooling dynamics to establish a cost optimal baseline operation, and (ii) a duration-aware flexibility assessment that, for any given start time and power deviation, computes the maximum feasible duration from this baseline while respecting all operational, thermal, and recovery constraints. This method characterises the aggregate flexibility envelope. Results reveal a clear temporal structure and a notable asymmetry in flexibility provision: upward flexibility (electricity load reduction) is driven by deferring IT workload, which allows for a secondary reduction in cooling power. Downward flexibility (electricity load increase) relies on increasing power consumption of the cooling system, supported by the TES buffer, and charging the UPS. This framework translates abstract flexibility potential into quantified flexibility magnitude and duration that system operators could investigate for use in services such as reserve, frequency response, and price responsive demand.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyi Wang, Angeliki Katsenou, Junxiao Shen, David Bull</p>
            <p>The prevalence of user-generated content (UGC) on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok has rendered no-reference (NR) perceptual video quality assessment (VQA) vital for optimizing video delivery. Nonetheless, the characteristics of non-professional acquisition and the subsequent transcoding of UGC video on sharing platforms present significant challenges for NR-VQA. Although NR-VQA models attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective scores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of fine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these challenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the semantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our approach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video metadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted from inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in generating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been designed to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic alignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These multimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality scores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving improved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations. Our method achieves the best performance in terms of average rank and linear correlation (SRCC: 0.928, PLCC: 0.938) compared to state-of-the-art methods.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cayetana Salinas Rodriguez, Jonathan Rogers, Sarah H.Q. Li</p>
            <p>We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) mapping is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. In those cases the leader needs to simultaneously infer this BR function while fulfilling an internal objective. We study a setting in which the leader selects a control strategy that optimizes an objective given an initial belief about the follower's best response. This belief is updated during the finite decision horizon, prompting the leader to reoptimize its control. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop (OL) and feedback (FB) information structures. In particular, we show that it is possible that assuming an incorrect follower BR map obtains a lower cost over the game horizon than knowing the true BR. We support these claims with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game.</p>

            <h2>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rathin Chandra Shit, Sharmila Subudhi</p>
            <p>The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\epsilon$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</p>

            <p>Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine learning model for precise diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers, including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132 radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning (ML) modeling algorithms were implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, AUROC, and AUPRC. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a training AUROC of 1.00 and a testing AUROC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) indicated a higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies, suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable ML model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Zhou, Wei-Jian Li, Desen Zhu, Hongbin Xu, Wei-Xin Ren</p>
            <p>While time-frequency analysis provides rich representations of multicomponent signals, current signal decomposition methods fail to fully exploit the spatial structure of time-frequency distributions, where components often manifest as morphologically distinct regions. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition (TFMD), a novel framework that reframes signal decomposition as a morphological segmentation task in the time-frequency domain. TFMD constructs a unique TF mask for each component by first identifying high-energy core regions with unsupervised k-means clustering, segmenting them with connected-component labeling and a size filter, and then expanding each core using an iterative competitive dilation algorithm to form the complete TF mask, enabling precise isolation and reconstruction of individual modes. Validation on a comprehensive suite of synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately identifies the number of components and reconstructs them with high fidelity, particularly excelling in high-noise conditions. A comparative analysis confirms that TFMD offers robust and competitive performance across diverse signal types, outperforming several benchmark methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Its practical utility is demonstrated by successfully decomposing a non-stationary wind turbine vibration signal, where a two-stage $\mathrm{TFMD}^2$ approach effectively isolates both the fundamental rotational frequency components and their weaker harmonic components across varying operational speeds. TFMD thus provides an accurate, adaptive, and efficient morphological segmentation framework for multicomponent signal analysis with broad applicability.</p>

            <h2>Onboard Hyperspectral Super-Resolution with Deep Pushbroom Neural Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Piccinini, Diego Valsesia, Enrico Magli</p>
            <p>Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one, on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are significantly more complex.</p>

            <h2>OPF-Based Optimal Power System Network Restoration Considering Frequency Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawn Virginillo, Asja Derviškadić, Mario Paolone</p>
            <p>Due to recent blackout and system split incidents in power grids worldwide, as well as increased system complexity in view of the energy transition, there has been increasing interest in re-evaluating existing Power System Restoration (PSR) plans. In restoration scenarios, due to low island inertia, it is necessary to ensure not only the static, but also the dynamic stability of the system. In this paper, we pose and solve a formulation of the optimal PSR problem including frequency dynamics. We validate the switching constraints for global optimality within a static version of the formulation using a brute-force tree search method. We apply the dynamic problem formulation to the IEEE 9-Bus model, and show that the optimal switching sequence using the static formulation would violate dynamic constraints, illustrating the importance of dynamic considerations in PSR planning.</p>

            <h2>Computationally Efficient Spline-Based Modeling of DER Dynamics for Voltage Stability in Active Distribution Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadrack T. Asiedu, Tara Aryal, Zongjie Wang, Hossein Moradi Rekabdarkolaee, Timothy M. Hansen</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into power systems necessitates the accurate representation of their dynamic behavior at the transmission level. Traditional electromagnetic transient models (EMT), while effective, face scalability challenges due to their reliance on detailed system information. Data-driven approaches, such as System Identification (SysID), offer a promising alternative by modeling system dynamics without detailed system knowledge. However, SysID and similar methods are computationally intensive, requiring the computation of complex ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or transfer functions estimation. This makes them less effective for real-time operation. We therefore propose a novel data-driven approach that simplifies the modeling of DERs dynamics by leveraging B-splines to transform discrete system data into continuous differentiable functions. This enables the estimation of lower order linear ordinary differential equations with simple linear regression to represent the underlying dynamics at a very low computational cost. Furthermore, the extracted dynamic equations are discretized by the backward Euler method for potential integration into discrete-time power dispatch models. Validation results indicate a goodness-of-fit (GoF) of 98.74%, comparable to the 99.03% GoF of the SysID method, yet, 4.8 times faster. Our proposed model's execution time of less than one minute makes it more suitable for real-time applications in power system operations.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating the Impact of a Load Admittance Approximation in Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Junior da Cunha Coelho, Araceli Hernandez, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>The Transient Stability-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF) incorporates dynamic stability constraints into the OPF formulation to ensure secure and economical operation under disturbances. While discretizing system dynamics enables the use of nonlinear programming techniques, it significantly increases computational burden. To enhance scalability, many studies simplify the network by representing loads as constant admittances, allowing the use of Kron reduction. However, computing the Kron reduction outside the optimization requires a voltage-based assumption to convert loads from constant power to constant admittance. This paper proposes a practical voltage-based load admittance approximation and evaluates the errors it may introduce in rotor angle and speed deviation trajectories. Case studies on the WECC 9-bus system show that the proposed approach reproduces rotor dynamics consistent with time-domain simulations during the first few seconds while considerably reducing implementation effort and mitigating convergence issues. The proposed framework thus offers a simple and effective strategy for scalable TSC-OPF implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ioannis Karampinis, Petros Ellinas, Johanna Vorwerk, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis</p>
            <p>Modern power systems require fast and accurate dynamic simulations for stability assessment, digital twins, and real-time control, but classical ODE solvers are often too slow for large-scale or online applications. We propose a neural-operator framework for surrogate modeling of power system components, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) to learn mappings from system states and time-varying inputs to full trajectories without step-by-step integration. To enhance generalization and data efficiency, we introduce Physics-Informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), which embed the residuals of governing equations into the training loss. Our results show that DeepONets, and especially PI-DeepONets, achieve accurate predictions under diverse scenarios, providing over 30 times speedup compared to high-order ODE solvers. Benchmarking against Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights superior stability and scalability. Our results demonstrate neural operators as a promising path toward real-time, physics-aware simulation of power system dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Voltage-Independent Active-Power Droop Coefficient for Enhanced Andronov-Hopf Oscillator Grid-Forming Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamed Rezazadeh, Mohammad Monfared, Meghdad Fazeli, Saeed Golestan</p>
            <p>In recent years, virtual oscillator control, particularly the Andronov-Hopf oscillator (AHO), has received widespread attention for controlling grid-forming (GFM) inverters due to their superior dynamic response. However, traditional AHO systems feature droop coefficients that are dependent on the oscillator voltage amplitude, limiting their ability to maintain consistent grid support during disturbances and resulting in power-sharing inaccuracies. This paper presents an enhanced AHO (EAHO) strategy, where the active power droop coefficient is no longer a function of the voltage amplitude and retains the key dynamic benefits of the original AHO. The EAHO improves both frequency and voltage support and ensures accurate power sharing with other GFM inverters in grid-connected and stand-alone modes. Extensive comparative and small-signal analyses, alongside experimental validation on 2.5 kVA single-phase inverters, confirm the EAHO's improved steady-state performance, enhanced active and reactive power support, and stable operation under varying grid conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Bernal, Ignacio Ponce, Federico Milano</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a coherency control strategy for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) to establish coherence among power system devices. Using the equivalence of the Complex Frequency (CF) of the injected currents as the definition for coherency among devices, the control enforces an output current with a proportional magnitude and a constant phase shift relative to a reference. This formulation makes the control technology-agnostic, enabling coherency with any type of resource. Case studies based on the two-area and IEEE 39-bus systems demonstrate the controller's potential to improve damping and overall dynamic behavior. The paper further evaluates practical implementation aspects including delay/noise sensitivity and the trade-off between oscillation mitigation and disturbance propagation. This work establishes coherency as a viable direct control objective for IBRs in modern power systems.</p>

            <p>As power systems evolve with increasing production from Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), their underlying dynamics are undergoing significant changes that can jeopardize system operation, leading to poorly damped oscillations or small-signal rotor angle instability. In this work, we investigate whether Power System Stabilizer (PSS) setting adjustments can effectively restore system stability and provide adequate damping in systems with increased IBR penetration, using the benchmark Kundur Two-Area System as a case study. Specifically, we evaluate the model-based Residues and P-Vref PSS tuning methods to examine their effectiveness under evolving grid conditions. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of these tuning methods is not guaranteed, particularly when coordination is limited. Consequently, our case study motivates local and adaptive online PSS tuning methods.</p>

            <p>An elementary Recurrent Neural Network that operates on p time lags, called an RNN(p), is the natural generalisation of a linear autoregressive model ARX(p). It is a powerful forecasting tool for variables displaying inherent seasonal patterns across multiple time scales, as is often observed in energy, economic, and financial time series. The architecture of RNN(p) models, characterised by structured feedbacks across time lags, enables the design of efficient training strategies. We conduct a comparative study of learning algorithms for these models, providing a rigorous analysis of their computational complexity and training performance. We present two applications of RNN(p) models in power consumption forecasting, a key domain within the energy sector where accurate forecasts inform both operational and financial decisions. Experimental results show that RNN(p) models achieve excellent forecasting accuracy while maintaining a high degree of interpretability. These features make them well-suited for decision-making in energy markets and other fintech applications where reliable predictions play a significant economic role.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dániel István Németh, Kálmán Tornai</p>
            <p>Electrical load classification is generally divided into intrusive and non-intrusive approaches, both having their limitations and advantages. With the non-intrusive approach, controlling appliances is not possible, but the installation cost of a single measurement device is cheap. In comparison, intrusive, smart plug-based solutions offer individual appliance control, but the installation cost is much higher. There have been very few approaches aiming to combine these methods. In this paper we show that extending a smart plug-based solution to multiple loads per plug can reduce control granularity in favor of lowering the system's installation costs. Connecting various loads to a Smart Plug through an extension cord is seldom considered in the literature, even though it is common in households. This scenario is also handled by the hybrid load classification solution presented in this paper.</p>

We categorize state-of-the-art modeling methods into statistical, simulated, and data-driven approaches, examining the advantages and drawbacks of each. Additionally, we analyze the three bottom-up level operations of information fusion in existing models.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guang An Ooi, Otavio Bertozzi, Mohd Asim Aftab, Charalambos Konstantinou, Shehab Ahmed</p>
            <p>Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85\%, 99.90\%, and 99.69\% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82\% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</p>

            <p>Buses are a vital component of metropolitan public transport, yet conventional bus services often struggle with inefficiencies including extended dwelling time, which increases in-vehicle travel time for non-alighting passengers. A stop-less autonomous modular (SLAM) bus service has emerged as a solution, enabling dynamic capacity to reduce dwelling time. Meanwhile, the electrification of buses is advancing as a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduces operators' costs, but introduces new operational constraints due to charging requirements. This study develops analytical optimization models for SLAM bus service that integrates vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging technology. By comparing the optimal designs and their feasibility across non-charging case and charging strategies, we identify a sequence of operational stages as ridership grows: from idle capacity under low demand, to full small buses, full large buses, and a proposed frequency-capped regime where only bus capacity expands. Under the mobile charging strategy, this progression further includes an energy-limited regime, in which frequency declines, and ultimately infeasibility under high demand. These findings enable operators to deliver more efficient services.</p>

            <p>Integrating flexible loads and storage systems into the residential sector contributes to the alignment of volatile renewable generation with demand. Besides batteries serving as a short-term storage solution, residential buildings can benefit from a Hydrogen (H2) storage system, allowing seasonal shifting of renewable energy. However, as the initial costs of H2 systems are high, coupling a Fuel Cell (FC) with a Heat Pump (HP) can contribute to the size reduction of the H2 system. The present study develops a Comfort-Oriented Energy Management System for Residential Buildings (ComEMS4Build) comprising Photovoltaics (PV), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and H2 storage, where FC and HP are envisioned as complementary technologies. The fuzzy-logic-based ComEMS4Build is designed and evaluated over a period of 12 weeks in winter for a family household building in Germany using a semi-synthetic modeling approach. The Rule-Based Control (RBC), which serves as a lower benchmark, is a scheduler designed to require minimal inputs for operation. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) is intended as a cost-optimal benchmark with an ideal forecast. The results show that ComEMS4Build, similar to MPC, does not violate the thermal comfort of occupants in 10 out of 12 weeks, while RBC has a slightly higher median discomfort of 0.68 Kh. The ComEMS4Build increases the weekly electricity costs by 12.06 EUR compared to MPC, while RBC increases the weekly costs by 30.14 EUR. The ComEMS4Build improves the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) utilization and energy exchange with the main grid compared to the RBC. However, when it comes to the FC operation, the RBC has an advantage, as it reduces the toggling counts by 3.48% and working hours by 7.59% compared to MPC...</p>

            <p>Hybrid power plants (HPPs) combine multiple power generators (conventional/variable) and energy storage capabilities to support generation inadequacy and grid demands. This paper introduces a modeling and control design framework for hybrid power plants (HPPs) consisting of a wind farm, solar plant, and battery storage.

In the case of wind and battery models, generator torque and cell current control laws are developed using nonlinear control and control barrier function techniques to track a command from a supervisory control law while maintaining safe and stable operation. The utility of this modeling and control framework is illustrated through a test case using a utility demand signal for tracking, time varying wind and irradiance data, and a rule-based supervisory control law.</p>

            <p>The electric grid is increasingly vital, supporting essential services such as healthcare, heating and cooling transportation, telecommunications, and water systems. This growing dependence on reliable power underscores the need for enhanced grid resilience. This study presents Eversource's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) for bulk distribution substations in Massachusetts, evaluating risks from storm surge, sea level rise, precipitation, and extreme temperatures. The focus is on developing a cost-efficient model to guide targeted resilience investments. This is achieved by overcoming the limitations of single-variable analyses through hazard-specific assessments that integrate spatial, climate, electrical asset, and other relevant data; and applying sensitivity analysis to establish data-driven thresholds for actionable climate risks. By integrating geospatial analysis and data modeling with power engineering principles, this study provides a practical and replicable framework for equitable, data-informed climate adaptation planning. The results indicate that thresholds for certain climate hazards can be highly sensitive and result in significantly larger sets of stations requiring mitigation measures to adequately adapt to climate change, indicating that high-fidelity long-term climate projections are critical.</p>

            <p>Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid. However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather prediction service.</p>

            <p>In recent years, several studies conducted by both industry and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-funded initiatives have proposed linking North America's Eastern and Western Interconnections (EI and WI) through a multiterminal DC (MTDC) macrogrid. These studies have explored the advantages and opportunities of the proposed configuration from the perspectives of capacity sharing and frequency support. However, the potential challenges of small-signal stability arising from this interconnection have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, detailed model-based simulation studies are performed in this paper to assess the risks of poorly damped inter-area oscillations in the proposed macrogrid. A custom-built dynamic model of the MTDC system is developed and integrated with industry-grade models of the EI and WI, incorporating high levels of inverter-based energy resources. Through model-based oscillation analysis, potential shifts in inter-area modes for both EI and WI, resulting from the MTDC integration are characterized, and modes with inadequate damping are identified. Furthermore, to mitigate the risks of unstable oscillations, supplementary damping controllers are designed for the MTDC system, leveraging wide-area feedback to modulate active power set points at selected converter stations. A frequency scanning approach is employed for data-driven model linearization and controller synthesis. The damping performance is evaluated under the designed operating conditions and selected contingency scenarios.</p>

            <p>The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is significantly affecting the power grid, causing large-scale outages and impacting power system resilience. Yet limited work has been done on systematically modeling the impacts of weather parameters to quantify resilience. This study presents a framework using statistical and Bayesian learning approaches to quantitatively model the relationship between weather parameters and power system resilience metrics. By leveraging real-world publicly available outage and weather data, we identify key weather variables of wind speed, temperature, and precipitation influencing a particular region's resilience metrics. A case study of Cook County, Illinois, and Miami-Dade County, Florida, reveals that these weather parameters are critical factors in resiliency analysis and risk assessment. Additionally, we find that these weather variables have combined effects when studied jointly compared to their effects in isolation. This framework provides valuable insights for understanding how weather events affect power distribution system performance, supporting decision-makers in developing more effective strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and adaptation to changing climatic conditions.</p>

            <p>Microgrids offer a promising paradigm for integrating distributed energy resources, bolstering energy resilience, and reducing the impact of blackouts. However, their inherent decentralization and dynamic operation present substantial energy management complexities. These complexities, including balancing supply and demand, ensuring system stability, and minimizing operational costs, often necessitate solving computationally intractable NP-hard Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problems. Traditional MINLP solvers struggle with the scalability and feasibility guarantees required for these challenges. To address this, this paper tackles the problem of resource allocation and radial configuration design for microgrid power distribution and proposes and abstracted problem which is solved by introducing a permutation-based iterative search method over the recently introduced FORWARD method to efficiently identify feasible, near-optimal radial network structures while inherently respecting physical constraints. Furthermore, this paper investigates the integration of the proposed method as a warm-start strategy for benchmark MINLP solvers offering a scalable solution for comprehensive microgrid design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gutierrez-Florensa, F. Sanniti, D. Tedeschi, L. Sigrist, A. Ortega, F. Milano</p>
            <p>A precise estimation of the Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF) is crucial for secure power system operation. In fact, RoCoF is strictly related to the amount of the available physical and/or virtual inertia of the system and the severity of the active power unbalance following a disturbance. For this reason, it is widely exploited in different protection systems, e.g., Anti-Islanding, Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) and wide-area protection systems. The new paradigm of modern power systems, with a low-inertia and converter-based generation assets, is increasing the transient severity, making the frequency and the RoCoF estimation more complex and less precise for the actual devices. This work addresses this issue by proposing a numerically robust approach based on concepts inherited from differential geometry and fluid mechanics. The proposed approach is then tested with high-sampling real experimental measurements and used to develop a faster control logic for a RoCoF-based UFLS control scheme. The proposed approach provides information to protections regarding the nature of the contingency which can be used to improve its response.</p>

            <h2>D2-UC: A Distributed-Distributed Quantum-Classical Framework for Unit Commitment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold. First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

            <h2>Explicit Ensemble Learning Surrogate for Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Bahador Javadi, Amin Kargarian</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of renewable generation introduces uncertainty into power systems, challenging traditional deterministic optimization methods. Chance-constrained optimization offers an approach to balancing cost and risk; however, incorporating joint chance constraints introduces computational challenges. This paper presents an ensemble support vector machine surrogate for joint chance constraint optimal power flow, where multiple linear classifiers are trained on simulated optimal power flow data and embedded as tractable hyperplane constraints via Big--M reformulations. The surrogate yields a polyhedral approximation of probabilistic line flow limits that preserves interpretability and scalability. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system show that the proposed method achieves near-optimal costs with a negligible average error of $0.03\%$. These results demonstrate the promise of ensemble surrogates as efficient and transparent tools for risk-aware optimization of power systems.</p>

            <h2>Accounting for Subsystem Aging Variability in Battery Energy Storage System Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melina Graner, Martin Cornejo, Holger Hesse, Andreas Jossen</p>
            <p>This paper presents a degradation-cost-aware optimization framework for multi-string battery energy storage systems, emphasizing the impact of inhomogeneous subsystem-level aging in operational decision-making. We evaluate four scenarios for an energy arbitrage scenario, that vary in model precision and treatment of aging costs. Key performance metrics include operational revenue, power schedule mismatch, missed revenues, capacity losses, and revenue generated per unit of capacity loss. Our analysis reveals that ignoring heterogeneity of subunits may lead to infeasible dispatch plans and reduced revenues. In contrast, combining accurate representation of degraded subsystems and the consideration of aging costs in the objective function improves operational accuracy and economic efficiency of BESS with heterogeneous aged subunits. The fully informed scenario, which combines aging-cost-aware optimization with precise string-level modeling, achieves 21% higher revenue per unit of SOH loss compared to the baseline scenario. These findings highlight that modeling aging heterogeneity is not just a technical refinement but may become a crucial enabler for maximizing both short-term profitability and long-term asset value in particular for long BESS usage scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Taheri, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems that accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method -- a Quasi-Newton optimization technique -- this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.</p>

            <h2>Gas Fire Power Plant Management Through Numerical Approximation of Spark Spread Options</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babacar Seck, Anas Abdullah</p>
            <p>Cross-commodity valuation approaches to value gas fire power plants are well studied in the literature. Hence, the value of the gas fire power plant is identical to the value of a spark spread option wherein the underlying are electricity and gas with a strike price assimilated to operating and maintenance costs. Power and fuels spot prices account for uncertain futures cash-flows for power-plant generator owners. For instance, for gas-fired turbine plant, spot prices of electricity and gas determine the random cash-flows of the power-plant. Other than the spot prices, the valuation of such plant involves among other deterministic cost the plant heat rate and operating costs. Recently, the cost of emissions is considered into the valuation to tackle environmental issues. Given some simplifications in the plant cash-flow modelling, the value of such plant can either be expressed as the price of i) a cross-commodity option or ii) the price of a real option. Here, we focus on cross-commodity option valuation approach where the value of the power plant is approached as the value of a spark spread option. When spot prices of the underlying commodities are log-normal, closed formulae or approximations can be obtained using Kirk's approximation. Naturally, the spot price of electricity and gas present spikes due to seasonality among other factors. However, in that case it is not possible to get a closed formula for the spark spread option. In this paper we explore possibilities to approximate spark spread options when spot prices fall into a class of jump diffusion processes.</p>

            <h2>Recurrence Plot and Change Quantile-based Deep Supervised and Semi-supervised Protection for Transmission Lines Connected to Photovoltaic Plants</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pallav Kumar Bera, Samita Rani Pani</p>
            <p>Conventional relays encounter difficulties in protecting transmission lines (TLs) connected to converter-based energy sources (CBESs) due to the influence of power electronics on fault characteristics. This article proposes a single-ended intelligent protection method for the TL segment between the grid and a Photovoltaic (PV) plant. The approach utilizes a Recurrence Matrix and an InceptionTime-based system to identify faults by using the mean change in quantiles of 3-phase currents. It determines the fault position and identifies the faulty phase. ReliefF feature selection is applied to extract the optimal quantile features. The scheme's performance is assessed under abnormal conditions, including faults and capacitor and load-switching events, simulated in Power Systems Computer Aided Design / Electromagnetic Transients Program (PSCAD/EMTDC) on the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus system, with various fault and switching parameters. The scheme is also validated on the New England IEEE 39-bus system and in presence of partially rated converters. Additionally, the validation of the proposed strategy takes into account various conditions, including double-circuit line configuration, noise, series compensation, high-impedance faults, current transformer (CT) saturation, evolving and cross-country faults, remote and local faults, as well as variations in PV capacity, sampling frequency, and data window size. To address label scarcity and improve generalization, semi-supervised learning paradigms including label spreading, label propagation, and self-training are integrated with the InceptionTime framework, enabling near-supervised performance with limited annotated fault data. The results demonstrate that the approach is effective in handling different system configurations and conditions, ensuring the protection of TLs connected to large PV plants.</p>

            <h2>A Reliability-Cost Optimization Framework for EV and DER Integration in Standard and Reconfigurable Distribution Network Topologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rida Fatima, Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption poses operational and economic challenges for power distribution systems, including increased line loading levels and network congestions. This may require potential infrastructure reinforcement and expansion. As a fast inexpensive alternative solution, network topology reconfiguration (NTR) offers a practical means to redistribute power flows, reduce operational costs, and defer infrastructure upgrades. This paper presents a linear programming framework to evaluate the impact of varying EV penetration on operational costs under four configurations: standard distribution network (SDN), SDN with NTR (SDNTR), SDN with distributed energy resources (SDN-DER), and SDNTR with DERs (SDNTR-DER). Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus system. The analysis demonstrates that integrating DERs reduces operational costs, while NTR further enhances system flexibility, enabling higher EV penetration levels without compromising feasibility. The combined SDNTR-DER approach offers the most cost-effective and reliable pathway for accommodating future EV growth while mitigating the need for immediate infrastructure upgrades.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel control framework designed for Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), denoted as Generalized Swing Control (GSC). The proposed GSC framework generalizes the definition of Grid-Forming (GFM) control schemes and exploits the coupling between active and reactive power dynamics. To validate the proposed scheme, we conduct extensive time-domain simulations and small-signal analysis using a modified version of the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus dynamic model of the all-island Irish transmission system. The case studies focus on evaluating the dynamic performance of the proposed framework under different configurations, including Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM), coupled-VSM and dual-VSM schemes. To address the nonlinear nature of power system dynamics, sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo methods are employed to improve parameter tuning and assess the stability of GSC configurations in the studied systems.</p>

            <p>The paper proposes a novel general definition of coherency among power system devices of any type. The proposed approach is thus not limited to synchronous machines. With this aim, the paper shows that coherency can be formally based on the difference in the complex frequency of the current injections of any two devices electrically connected to the same grid. The proposed definition is model-agnostic, making it general and suitable for modern power systems composed of a heterogeneous mix of technologies. The paper also provides a systematic analytical procedure to study the properties that specific device models must satisfy to be coherent. Time-domain simulations are conducted in three case studies whose results illustrate the ability of our definition to evaluate coherency among any type of device.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a decentralized methodology for detecting and mitigating flapping phenomena in power systems, primarily caused by the operation of discrete devices. The proposed approach applies moving-window autocorrelation to local measurements, enabling each device to autonomously identify sustained oscillations. Upon detection, a probabilistic, device-specific mitigation strategy is executed. Flexible demand resources (DFRs), under-load tap changers (ULTCs), and automatic voltage regulators (AVRs) are utilised to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach to both discrete and continuous-operation devices. Results show that the proposed method is robust and properly distinguishes damped oscillations from persistent flapping, allowing devices to independently recognize problematic operating scenarios and implement corrective actions accordingly.</p>

            <h2>Analytical Framework for Assessing Effective Regional Inertia</h2>

            <p>This paper proposes a novel formulation of effective regional inertia that explicitly accounts for both system topology and the spatial distribution of inertia. Unlike traditional approaches that model a region as an aggregated machine with an equivalent inertia, the proposed metric provides a topology-aware representation. The methodology builds on an analytical framework that extends classical slow coherency theory to address network partitioning and regional frequency stability. Based on these partitions, we develop a systematic procedure to evaluate the effective inertia of each region, enabling a more accurate interpretation of local inertial contributions, including those from virtual inertia provided by inverter-based resources (IBRs). Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus systems demonstrate that the integration of inertial devices does not uniformly improve system frequency response, underscoring the importance of the proposed metric for effective regional inertia assessment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiziano Balaconi, Aldo Glielmo, Marco Taboga</p>
            <p>We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjian Tuo, Xingpeng Li, Pascal Van Hentenryck</p>
            <p>TThe rapid expansion of inverter-based resources, such as wind and solar power plants, will significantly diminish the presence of conventional synchronous generators in fu-ture power grids with rich renewable energy sources. This transition introduces in-creased complexity and reduces dynamic stability in system operation and control, with low inertia being a widely recognized challenge. However, the literature has not thoroughly explored grid dynamic performance associated with energy scheduling so-lutions that traditionally only consider grid steady-state constraints. This paper will bridge the gap by enforcing grid dynamic constraints when conducting optimal energy scheduling; particularly, this paper explores locational post-contingency rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) requirements to accommodate substantial inertia reductions. This paper introduces a machine learning-assisted RoCoF-constrained unit commit-ment (ML-RCUC) model designed to ensure RoCoF stability after the most severe generator outage while maintaining operational efficiency. A graph-informed NN (GINN)-based RoCoF predictor is first trained on a high-fidelity simulation dataset to track the highest locational RoCoF, which is then reformulated as mixed-integer linear programming constraints that are integrated into the unit commitment model. Case studies, by solving the optimization problem ML-RCUC and validating its solutions with time-domain simulations, demonstrate that the proposed method can ensure loca-tional RoCoF stability with minimum conservativeness.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixiao Yang, Gulai Shen, Ahmed S. Alahmed, Chuchu Fan</p>
            <p>We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering tariffs with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based structure. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to a theoretical upper bound.</p>

This study applies detailed energy system modeling to quantify the Renewable Pull, an incentive for industry relocation exerted by countries with favorable renewable conditions. Results reveal that the Renewable Pull is not a cross-industrial phenomenon but strongly depends on the relationship between energy costs and transport costs. The intensity of the Renewable Pull varies, with China, India, and Japan facing a significantly stronger effect than Germany and the United States. Incorporating national capital cost assumptions proves critical, reducing Germanys Renewable Pull by a factor of six and positioning it as the second least affected top manufacturing country after Saudi Arabia. Using Germany as a case study, the analysis moreover illustrates that targeted import strategies, especially within the EU, can nearly eliminate the Renewable Pull, offering policymakers clear options for risk mitigation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Wang, Zhengmao Li, Luis Badesa</p>
            <p>In low-carbon grids, system flexibility can be enhanced through mechanisms such as Demand Response (DR), enabling the efficient utilization of renewable energy. However, as Synchronous Generators (SGs) are being replaced with renewable energy characterized by Inverter-Based Resources (IBR), system stability is severely affected. Due to the limited overload capability of IBR, their Short-Circuit Current (SCC) contribution is much smaller than that of SGs, which may result in protection devices failing to trip during faults. Consequently, the remaining SGs play a key role in offering sufficient SCC volumes. Given that the commitment of SGs is closely related to system load, DR can thus indirectly affect their SCC provision, a relationship that has not been investigated. Therefore, this paper incorporates both DR and SCC constraints into a unit commitment model and conducts studies on an IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that although DR can reduce social costs by lowering power demand, it may also lead to inadequate SCC levels. Nevertheless, the cost increases by only 0.3% when DR is combined with SCC constraints, indicating that DR can actually help achieve a stable system in a cost-effective manner.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linhan Fang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The escalating adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and the growing demand for charging solutions are driving a surge in EV charger installations in distribution networks. However, this rising EV load strains the distribution grid, causing severe voltage drops, particularly at feeder extremities. This study proposes a proactive voltage management (PVM) framework that can integrate Monte Carlo-based simulations of varying EV charging loads to (i) identify potential voltage violations through a voltage violation analysis (VVA) model, and (ii) then mitigate those violations with optimally-invested battery energy storage systems (BESS) through an optimal expansion planning (OEP) model. A novel spatio-temporal adaptive targeting (STAT) strategy is proposed to alleviate the computational complexity of the OEP model by defining a targeted OEP (T-OEP) model, solved by applying the OEP model to (i) a reduced set of representative critical time periods and (ii) candidate BESS installation nodes. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed approach are validated on 33-bus, 69-bus, and a large-scale 240-bus system. Results demonstrate that the strategic sizing and placement of BESS not only effectively mitigate voltage violations but also yield substantial cost savings on electricity purchases under time-of-use tariffs. This research offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for integrating high penetrations of EVs, providing crucial insights for future distribution network planning.</p>

In energy systems, network reconfiguration can substantially reduce losses and costs and thus support the energy transition. Unfortunately, many related optimization problems are NP hard, restricting practical applications. In this article, we address the problem of minimizing losses in radial networks, a problem that routinely arises in distribution grid operation. We show that even the computation of approximate solutions is computationally hard and propose quantum optimization as a promising alternative. We derive two quantum algorithmic primitives based on the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) that differ in the sampling of network topologies: a tailored sampling of radial topologies and simple sampling with penalty terms to suppress non-radial topologies. We show how to apply these algorithmic primitives to distribution grid reconfiguration and quantify the necessary quantum resources.</p>

            <p>Resource scheduling is critical in many industries, especially in power systems. The Unit Commitment problem determines the on/off status and output levels of generators under many constraints. Traditional exact methods, such as mathematical programming methods or dynamic programming, remain the backbone of UC solution techniques, but they often rely on linear approximations or exhaustive search, leading to high computational burdens as system size grows. Metaheuristic approaches, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and other evolutionary methods, have been explored to mitigate this complexity; however, they typically lack optimality guarantees, exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions, and can become prohibitively time-consuming for large-scale systems. In this paper, we introduce a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for UC and, by extension, other resource scheduling problems, that leverages Benders decomposition to decouple binary commitment decisions from continuous economic dispatch. The binary master problem is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model and solved on a quantum annealer. The continuous subproblem, which minimizes generation costs, with Lagrangian cuts feeding back to the master until convergence. We evaluate our hybrid framework on systems scaled from 10 to 1,000 generation units. Compared against a classical mixed-integer nonlinear programming baseline, the hybrid algorithm achieves a consistently lower computation-time growth rate and maintains an absolute optimality gap below 1.63%. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum annealing within a hybrid quantum-classical Benders decomposition loop can significantly accelerate large-scale resource scheduling without sacrificing solution quality, pointing toward a viable path for addressing the escalating complexity of modern power grids.</p>

            <p>The power grid is the foundation of modern society, however extreme weather events have increasingly caused widespread outages. Enhancing grid resilience is therefore critical to maintaining secure and reliable operations. In disaster relief and restoration, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology allows electric vehicles (EVs) to serve as mobile energy resources by discharging to support critical loads or regulating grid frequency as needed. Effective V2G operation requires coordinated charging and discharging of many EVs through optimization. Similarly, in grid restoration, EVs must be strategically routed to affected areas, forming the mobile charging station placement (CSP) problem, which presents another complex optimization challenge. This work reviews state-of-the-art optimization methods for V2G and mobile CSP applications, outlines their limitations, and explores how quantum computing (QC) could overcome current computational bottlenecks. A QC-focused perspective is presented on enhancing grid resilience and accelerating restoration as extreme weather events grow more frequent and severe.</p>

            <p>This work proposes a conformal approach for energy storage arbitrage to control the downside risks arose from imperfect price forecasts. Energy storage arbitrage relies solely on predictions of future market prices, while inaccurate price predictions may lead to significant profit losses. Based on conformal decision theory, we describe a controller that dynamically adjusts decision conservativeness through prediction sets without distributional assumptions. To enable online calibration when online profit loss feedback is unobservable, we establish that a temporal difference error serves as a measurable proxy. Building on this insight, we develop two online calibration strategies: prediction error-based adaptation targeting forecast accuracy, and value error-based calibration focusing on decision quality. Analysis of the conformal controller proves bounded long-term risk with convergence guarantees in temporal difference error, which further effectively manages risk exposure in potential profit losses. Case studies demonstrate superior performance in balancing risk and opportunity compared to benchmarks under varying forecast conditions.</p>

            <p>This paper explores a deliberately over-engineered approach to the classical problem of parity detection -- determining whether a number is odd or even -- by combining wavelet-based feature extraction with unsupervised clustering. Instead of relying on modular arithmetic, integers are transformed into wavelet-domain representations, from which multi-scale statistical features are extracted and clustered using the k-means algorithm. The resulting feature space reveals meaningful structural differences between odd and even numbers, achieving a classification accuracy of approximately 69.67% without any label supervision. These results suggest that classical signal-processing techniques, originally designed for continuous data, can uncover latent structure even in purely discrete symbolic domains. Beyond parity detection, the study provides an illustrative perspective on how feature engineering and clustering may be repurposed for unconventional machine learning problems, potentially bridging symbolic reasoning and feature-based learning.</p>

            <h2>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishal Halder, Alexandre Reiffers-Masson, Abdeldjalil Aïssa-El-Bey, Gugan Thoppe</p>
            <p>Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest set containing $x^\star$--hence the one conveying maximal information about $x^\star$--that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the best that one can hope to recover is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-level Dynamics and System-Level Strength</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehao Zhuang, Huanhai Xin, Verena Häberle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian Dörfler</p>
            <p>Grid-forming (GFM) technology is widely regarded as a promising solution for future power systems dominated by power electronics. However, a precise method for quantifying GFM converter behavior and a universally accepted GFM definition remain elusive. Moreover, the impact of GFM on system stability is not precisely quantified, creating a significant disconnect between device and system levels. To address these gaps from a small-signal perspective, at the device level, we introduce a novel metric, the Forming Index (FI) to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage fluctuations. Rather than enumerating various control architectures, the FI provides a metric for the converter's GFM ability by quantifying its sensitivity to grid variations. At the system level, we propose a new quantitative measure of system strength that captures the multi-bus voltage stiffness, which quantifies the voltage and phase angle responses of multiple buses to current or power disturbances. We further extend this concept to grid strength and bus strength to identify weak areas within the system. Finally, we bridge the device and system levels by formally proving that GFM converters enhance system strength. Our proposed framework provides a unified benchmark for GFM converter design, optimal placement, and system stability assessment.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Control for a Physics-Informed Model of a Thermal Energy Distribution System: Qualitative Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paul Seurin, Auradha Annaswamy, Linyu Lin</p>
            <p>Integrated energy systems (IES) are complex heterogeneous architectures that typically encompass power sources, hydrogen electrolyzers, energy storage, and heat exchangers. This integration is achieved through operating control strategy optimization. However, the lack of physical understanding as to how these systems evolve over time introduces uncertainties that hinder reliable application thereof. Techniques that can accommodate such uncertainties are fundamental for ensuring proper operation of these systems. Unfortunately, no unifying methodology exists for accommodating uncertainties in this regard. That being said, adaptive control (AC) is a discipline that may allow for accommodating such uncertainties in real-time. In the present work, we derive an AC formulation for linear systems in which all states are observable and apply it to the control of a glycol heat exchanger (GHX) in an IES. Based on prior research in which we quantified the uncertainties of the GHXs system dynamics, we introduced an error of 50% on four terms of the nominal model. In the case where a linear quadratic regulator is used as the nominal control for the reference system, we found that employing AC can reduce the mean absolute error and integral time absolute error by a factor of 30%-75%. This reduction is achieved with minimal computing overhead and control infrastructure, thus underscoring the strength of AC. However, the control effort induced is significant, therefore warranting further study in order to estimate its impact on a physical system. To address further challenges, including partially observable and non-linear dynamics, enhancements of the linear formulation are currently being developed.</p>

            <h2>Context-Aware Stochastic Modeling of Consumer Energy Resource Aggregators in Electricity Markets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chatum Sankalpa, Ghulam Mohy-ud-din, Erik Weyer, Maria Vrakopoulou</p>
            <p>Aggregators of consumer energy resources (CERs) like rooftop solar and battery energy storage (BES) face challenges due to their inherent uncertainties. A sensible approach is to use stochastic optimization to handle such uncertainties, which can lead to infeasible problems or loss in revenues if not chosen appropriately. This paper presents three efficient two-stage stochastic optimization methods: risk-neutral, robust, and chance-constrained, to address the impact of CER uncertainties for aggregators who participate in energy and regulation services markets in the Australian National Electricity Market. Furthermore, these methods utilize the flexibility of BES, considering precise state-of-charge dynamics and complementarity constraints, aiming for scalable performance while managing uncertainty. The problems are formed as two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs, with relaxations adopted for large scenario sets. The solution approach employs scenario-based methodologies and affine recourse policies to obtain tractable reformulations. These methods are evaluated across use cases reflecting diverse operational and market settings, uncertainty characteristics, and decision-making preferences, demonstrating their ability to mitigate uncertainty, enhance profitability, and provide context-aware guidance for aggregators in choosing the most appropriate stochastic optimization method.</p>

            <p>Energy storage can promote the integration of renewables by operating with charge and discharge policies that balance an intermittent power supply. This study investigates the scheduling of energy storage assets under energy price uncertainty, with a focus on electricity markets. A two-stage stochastic risk-constrained approach is employed, whereby electricity price trajectories or specific power markets are observed, allowing for recourse in the schedule. Conditional value-at-risk is used to quantify tail risk in the optimization problems; this allows for the explicit specification of a probabilistic risk limit. The proposed approach is tested in an integrated hydrogen system (IHS) and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In the joint design and operation context for the IHS, the risk constraint results in larger installed unit capacities, increasing capital cost but enabling more energy inventory to buffer price uncertainty. As shown in both case studies, there is an operational trade-off between risk and expected reward; this is reflected in higher expected costs (or lower expected profits) with increasing levels of risk aversion. Despite the decrease in expected reward, both systems exhibit substantial benefits of increasing risk aversion. This work provides a general method to address uncertainties in energy storage scheduling, allowing operators to input their level of risk tolerance on asset decisions.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Equilibrium for Electricity Markets with Spatially Flexible Loads</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nan Gu, Junjie Qin</p>
            <p>Electric vehicle charging and geo-distributed datacenters introduce spatially flexible loads (FLs) that couple power, transportation, and datacenter networks. These couplings create a closed-loop feedback between locational marginal prices (LMPs) and decisions of the FL systems, challenging the foundations of conventional competitive equilibrium (CE) in electricity markets. This paper studies a notion of generalized competitive equilibrium (GCE) that aims to capture such price-demand interactions across the interconnected infrastructures. We establish structural conditions under which the GCE preserves key properties of the conventional CE, including existence, uniqueness, and efficiency, without requiring detailed knowledge of decision processes for individual FL systems. The framework generalizes to settings where the grid is coupled with multiple FL systems. Stylized examples and case studies on the New York ISO grid, coupled with the Sioux Falls transportation and distributed datacenter networks, demonstrate the use of our theoretical framework and illustrate the mutual influence among the grid and the studied FL systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imran Pervez, Omar Knio</p>
            <p>We developed a new integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodology to predict context-aware unknown parameters in economic dispatch (ED), a crucial problem in power systems solved to generate optimal power dispatching decisions to serve consumer load. The ED formulation in the current study consists of load and renewable generation as unknown parameters in its constraints predicted using contextual information (e.g., prior load, temperature). The ILO framework train a neural network (NN) to estimate ED parameters by minimizing an application-specific regret function which is a difference between ground truth and NN-driven decisions favouring better ED decisions. We thoroughly analyze the feasible region of ED formulation to understand the impact of load and renewable learning together on the ED decisions. Corresponding to that we developed a new regret function to capture real-time electricity market operations where differences in predicted and true loads are corrected by ramping generators in real-time but at a higher cost than the market price. The proposed regret function when minimized using ILO framework train the NN to guide the load and renewable predictions to generate ED decisions favouring minimum generator ramping costs. This is unlike conventional sequential learning and optimization (SLO) framework which train NN to accurately estimate load and renewable instead of better ED decisions. The combined training of load and renewable using ILO is a new concept and lead to significantly improved ramping costs when compared with SLO based training of load and renewable and SLO trained load with 100% accurate renewable proving its decision-focused capability.</p>

            <h2>Game Theoretic Resilience Recommendation Framework for CyberPhysical Microgrids Using Hypergraph MetaLearning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S Krishna Niketh, Prasanta K Panigrahi, V Vignesh, Mayukha Pal</p>
            <p>This paper presents a physics-aware cyberphysical resilience framework for radial microgrids under coordinated cyberattacks. The proposed approach models the attacker through a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) enhanced with model agnostic metalearning (MAML) to rapidly adapt to evolving defense strategies and predict high-impact contingencies. The defender is modeled via a bi-level Stackelberg game, where the upper level selects optimal tie-line switching and distributed energy resource (DER) dispatch using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) coordinator embedded within the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The framework simultaneously optimizes load served, operational cost, and voltage stability, ensuring all post-defense states satisfy network physics constraints. The methodology is first validated on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system with 12 DERs, 8 critical loads, and 5 tie-lines, and then extended to higher bus systems including the IEEE 123-bus feeder and a synthetic 300-bus distribution system. Results show that the proposed defense strategy restores nearly full service for 90% of top-ranked attacks, mitigates voltage violations, and identifies Feeder 2 as the principal vulnerability corridor. Actionable operating rules are derived, recommending pre-arming of specific tie-lines to enhance resilience, while higher bus system studies confirm scalability of the framework on the IEEE 123-bus and 300-bus systems.</p>

A new scenario-based problem formulation ensuring controlled risk with high confidence while minimizing the average cost is introduced.

A heuristic algorithm is proposed to find the number of support elements. Finally, an efficient method is presented to reduce the computational complexity of the SEMPC problem with an EES constraint. The approach is validated on a water distribution network, showing its effectiveness in balancing performance and risk.</p>

            <p>Lightweight online detection of series arc faults is critically needed in residential and industrial power systems to prevent electrical fires. Existing diagnostic methods struggle to achieve both rapid response and robust accuracy under resource-constrained conditions. To overcome the challenge, this work suggests leveraging a multi-frequency neural network named MFNN, embedding prior physical knowledge into the network. Inspired by arcing current curve and the Fourier decomposition analysis, we create an adaptive activation function with super-expressiveness, termed EAS, and a novel network architecture with branch networks to help MFNN extract features with multiple frequencies. In our experiments, eight advanced arc fault diagnosis models across an experimental dataset with multiple sampling times and multi-level noise are used to demonstrate the superiority of MFNN. The corresponding experiments show: 1) The MFNN outperforms other models in arc fault location, befitting from signal decomposition of branch networks. 2) The noise immunity of MFNN is much better than that of other models, achieving 14.51% over LCNN and 16.3% over BLS in test accuracy when SNR=-9. 3) EAS and the network architecture contribute to the excellent performance of MFNN.</p>

            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and distributed energy resources (DER) into modern power systems introduces significant uncertainty, posing challenges for maintaining grid flexibility and reliability. Hybrid energy systems (HES), composed of controllable generators, flexible loads, and battery storage, offer a decentralized solution to enhance flexibility compared to single centralized resources. This paper presents a two-level framework to enable HES participation in frequency regulation markets. The upper level performs a chance-constrained optimization to choose capacity bids based on historical regulation signals. At the lower level, a real-time control strategy disaggregates the regulation power among the constituent resources. This real-time control strategy is then benchmarked against an offline optimal dispatch to evaluate flexibility performance. Additionally, the framework evaluates the profitability of overbidding strategies and identifies thresholds beyond which performance degradation may lead to market penalties or disqualification. The proposed framework also compare the impact of imbalance of power capacities on performance and battery state of charge (SoC) through asymmetric HES configurations.</p>

            <p>The proliferation of inverter-based resources challenges traditional microgrid protection by introducing variable fault currents and complex transients. This paper presents a statistically adaptive differential protection scheme based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, implemented via a Bartlett-corrected G-statistic computed on logarithm-transformed current magnitudes. The method is a multivariate fault detection engine that employs the Mahalanobis distance to distinguish healthy and faulty states, enabling robust detection even in noisy environments. Detection thresholds are statistically derived from a chi-squared distribution for precise control over the false alarm rate. Upon detection, a lightweight classifier identifies the fault type by assessing per-phase G-statistics against dedicated thresholds, enhanced by a temporal persistence filter for security. Extensive simulations on a modified CIGRE 14-bus microgrid show high efficacy: sub-cycle average detection delays, high detection and classification accuracy across operating modes, resilience to high-impedance faults up to 250 Ohms, tolerance to 10 ms communication delay, and noise levels down to a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio. These findings demonstrate a reproducible and computationally efficient solution for next-generation AC microgrid protection.</p>

            <p>The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic, agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension, and future research.</p>

            <p>The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has created an urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly for the battery-constrained spatially distributed IoT nodes. While low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) employed with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities offer a promising solution, the line-of-sight channels that facilitate efficient energy delivery also expose sensitive operational data to adversaries. This paper proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user, while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>

            <p>We introduce mathematical tools and fixed point algorithms for optimal statistical max-min power control in cellular and cell-less massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous studies that rely on the use-and-then-forget (UatF) lower bound on Shannon achievable (ergodic) rates, our proposed framework can deal with alternative bounds that explicitly consider perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the decoder. In doing so, we address limitations of UatF-based power control algorithms, which inherit the shortcomings of the UatF bound. For example, the UatF bound can be overly conservative: in extreme cases, under fully statistical (nonadaptive) beamforming in zero-mean channels, the UatF bound produces trivial (zero) rate bounds. It also lacks scale invariance: merely scaling the beamformers can change the bound drastically. In contrast, our framework is compatible with information-theoretic bounds that do not suffer from the above drawbacks. We illustrate the framework by solving a max-min power control problem considering a standard bound that exploits instantaneous CSI at the decoder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Narges Rashvand, Kenneth Witham, Gabriel Maldonado, Vinit Katariya, Aly Sultan, Gunar Schirner, Hamed Tabkhi</p>
            <p>Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques. However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around 41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers, the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach. These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of bandwidth-limited wireless networks.</p>

However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.</p>

            <p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS), we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies. Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance, achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.</p>

            <h2>A Digital Twin Framework for Decision-Support and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure in Localized Urban Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Linh Do-Bui-Khanh, Thanh H. Nguyen, Nghi Huynh Quang, Doanh Nguyen-Ngoc, Laurent El Ghaoui</p>
            <p>As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments, optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction, energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios. Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW) solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible, computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to city-wide urban contexts.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic Long-Term Joint Decarbonization Planning for Power Systems and Data Centers: A Case Study in PJM</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Nanpeng Yu, Daniel Wong</p>
            <p>With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services, data centers have become critical infrastructures driving digital economies, with increasing energy demand heightening concerns over electricity use and carbon emissions, emphasizing the need for carbon-aware infrastructure planning. Most studies assume static power systems, focus only on operational emissions, and overlook co-optimization. This paper proposes a dynamic joint planning framework that co-optimizes long-term data center and power system development over 15 years. The model determines siting, capacity, and type of data centers alongside power generation expansion, storage deployment, and retirements, accounting for both operational and embodied emissions. To handle multi-scale uncertainty, a large-scale two-stage stochastic program is formulated and solved via an enhanced Benders decomposition. Applied to the PJM Interconnection, with curated datasets released on GitHub, results show the system can support up to 55 GW peak data center demand, with Virginia (DOM) and Northern Illinois (ComEd) as optimal hosts. Compared to non-joint planning, the framework cuts investment cost by 12.6%, operational cost by 8.25%, and emissions by 5.63%. Including lifecycle emissions further raises renewable deployment by 25.5%, highlighting embodied carbon's role in deeper decarbonization.</p>

            <h2>An OPF-based Control Framework for Hybrid AC-MTDC Power Systems under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongjin Du, Rahul Rane, Weijie Xia, Pedro P. Vergara, Aleksandra Lekić</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, introduces significant uncertainty into hybrid AC-HVDC systems due to forecast errors and power fluctuations. Conventional control strategies typically rely on fixed setpoints and neglect frequency deviations, which can compromise system stability under rapid renewable variations. To address this challenge, this paper presents a forecast-integrated, optimal power flow (OPF)-based adaptive control framework. Wind speed forecasts generated using a Random Forest model are incorporated into a time-coupled OPF to determine baseline converter setpoints in anticipation of wind fluctuations, which are further adjusted in real time based on actual operating conditions. An adaptive droop control scheme is developed that jointly considers DC voltage and AC frequency deviations. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, demonstrating its capability to ensure stable and robust operation of hybrid AC-HVDC systems under high penetration of renewable energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Bin Kwon, Sayak Mukherjee, Veronica Adetola</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</p>

            <h2>Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiangong Chen, Xia Lei, Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Yuchen Zhang, Christos Masouros, Athina P. Petropulu</p>
            <p>In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves' characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed. Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements, thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the actual target.</p>

            <h2>Maximal Load Shedding Verification for Neural Network Models of AC Line Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Chevalier, Duncan Starkenburg, Robert Parker, Noah Rhodes</p>
            <p>Solving for globally optimal line switching decisions in AC transmission grids can be intractability slow. Machine learning (ML) models, meanwhile, can be trained to predict near-optimal decisions at a fraction of the speed. Verifying the performance and impact of these ML models on network operation, however, is a critically important step prior to their actual deployment. In this paper, we train a Neural Network (NN) to solve the optimal power shutoff line switching problem. To assess the worst-case load shedding induced by this model, we propose a bilevel attacker-defender verification approach that finds the NN line switching decisions that cause the highest quantity of network load shedding. Solving this problem to global optimality is challenging (due to AC power flow and NN nonconvexities), so our approach exploits a convex relaxation of the AC physics, combined with a local NN search, to find a guaranteed lower bound on worst--case load shedding. These under-approximation bounds are solved via this http URL. We benchmark against a random sampling approach, and we find that our optimization-based approach always finds larger load shedding. Test results are collected on multiple PGLib test cases and on trained NN models which contain more than 10 million model parameters.</p>

            <h2>MDP-based Energy-aware Task Scheduling for Battery-less IoT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahab Jahanbazi, Mateen Ashraf, Onel L. A. López</p>
            <p>Realizing high long-term task completion rates represents a fundamental challenge in battery-less Internet of Things (IoT) devices powered by ambient energy harvesting. This difficulty is primarily due to the stochastic and time-varying characteristics of the available energy, which significantly complicate the design of optimal task scheduling policies. In this paper, we consider a battery-less IoT device that must periodically report sensing measurements to a monitoring center. We adopt the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to handle energy variability while aiming to maximize the long-term task completion rate. For this, we first identify its components and then define two appropriate reward functions. We demonstrate the inherent properties associated with the MDP formulation and the related optimal policy. Subsequently, we solve the resulting optimization problem, leading to the optimal stationary threshold-based (OSTB) scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that OSTB outperforms the well-known ``as late as possible'' (ALAP) scheduling strategy. For instance, an $8.6\%$ increase in the task completion rate, along with a $65\%$ reduction in power failures and a $86.29\%$ decrease in execution delays during task execution are registered assuming a $4.7$ mF capacitor.</p>

            <h2>Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Volt-VAR Optimization for Three-Phase Unbalanced Distribution Systems with Network Reconfiguration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Nanpeng Yu</p>
            <p>The increasing integration of intermittent distributed energy resources (DERs) has introduced significant variability in distribution networks, posing challenges to voltage regulation and reactive power management. This paper presents a novel neural two-stage stochastic Volt-VAR optimization (2S-VVO) method for three-phase unbalanced distribution systems considering network reconfiguration under uncertainty. To address the computational intractability associated with solving large-scale scenario-based 2S-VVO problems, a learning-based acceleration strategy is introduced, wherein the second-stage recourse model is approximated by a neural network. This neural approximation is embedded into the optimization model as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling effective enforcement of operational constraints related to the first-stage decisions. Numerical simulations on a 123-bus unbalanced distribution system demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves over 50 times speedup compared to conventional solvers and decomposition methods, while maintaining a typical optimality gap below 0.30%. These results underscore the method's efficacy and scalability in addressing large-scale stochastic VVO problems under practical operating conditions.</p>

            <h2>A Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Approach to Real-Time Economic Dispatch with Multi-Transmission-Node DER Aggregation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhentong Shao, Jingtao Qin, Xianbang Chen, Nanpeng Yu</p>
            <p>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into wholesale electricity markets, as mandated by FERC Order 2222, imposes new challenges on system operations. To remain consistent with existing market structures, regional transmission organizations (RTOs) have advanced the aggregation of transmission-node-level DERs (T-DERs), where a nodal virtual power plant (VPP) represents the mapping of all distribution-level DERs to their respective transmission nodes. This paper develops a real-time economic dispatch (RTED) framework that enables multi-transmission-node DER aggregation while addressing computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) for adaptive prediction of distribution factors (DFs), thereby capturing the dynamic influence of individual T-DERs across the transmission system. Furthermore, an iterative constraint identification strategy is incorporated to alleviate transmission security constraints without compromising system reliability. Together, these innovations accelerate the market clearing process and support the effective participation of T-DER aggregators under current market paradigms. The proposed approach is validated on large-scale test systems, including modified 118-, 2383-, and 3012-bus networks under a rolling RTED setting with real demand data. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing operational costs and maintaining transmission network feasibility, underscoring the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework.</p>

The proposed carbon-aware OPF model enables market operators to optimize energy dispatch while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

            <h2>Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis David Pabon Ospina, Martin Braun, Sushobhan Chatterjee, Sijia Geng</p>
            <p>Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</p>

            <h2>Design and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure with Battery in Commercial Buildings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quan Nguyen, Christine Holland, Siddharth Sridhar</p>
            <p>The installation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in buildings is inevitable, as states push for increased EV adoption to support decarbonization efforts. This transition could force the need for grid infrastructure upgrades and enhanced controls to support reliable power delivery to end-use loads, and overall economic operation. This paper evaluates strategies that address these needs on two fronts: i) optimal sizing of service transformers and battery energy storage systems (BESS), and ii) optimized coordination between EV charging, BESS operation, and building demand. These strategies are applied to a school campus setting, consisting of building and EV charging loads, to provide an illustration of energy management in commercial buildings with EV fleets. A rolling-window optimization approach is applied to determine i) optimal sizing of the service transformer and BESS and ii) optimal control of EV charging and BESS charge/discharge schedules. The design and control strategies are validated in a 20-year time horizon with an annually increasing number of EVs (buses and vans). In addition, an economic analysis is also carried out to show the costs and benefits of each design as a medium- and long-term investment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marko Orešković, Ivana Kuzmanović Ivičić, Juraj Benić, Mario Essert</p>
            <p>This paper presents a unified algebraic, topological, and logical framework for electrical one-port networks based on Šare's $m$-theory. Within this formalism, networks are represented by $m$-words (jorbs) over an ordered alphabet, where series and parallel composition induce an $m$-topology on $m$-graphs with a theta mapping $\vartheta$ that preserves one-port equivalence. The study formalizes quasi-orders, shells, and cores, showing their structural correspondence to network boundary conditions and impedance behavior. The $\lambda--\Delta$ metric, together with the valuation morphism $\Phi$, provides a concise descriptor of the impedance-degree structure. In the computational domain, the framework is extended with algorithmic procedures for generating and classifying non-isomorphic series-parallel topologies, accompanied by programmatic Cauer/Foster synthesis workflows and validation against canonical examples from Ladenheim's catalogue. The resulting approach enables symbolic-to-topological translation of impedance functions, offering a constructive bridge between algebraic representation and electrical realization. Overall, the paper outlines a self-consistent theoretical and computational foundation for automated network synthesis, classification, and formal verification within the emerging field of Jorbology.</p>

            <h2>A Hybrid GNN-LSE Method for Fast, Robust, and Physically-Consistent AC Power Flow</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Shamseldein</p>
            <p>Conventional AC Power Flow (ACPF) solvers like Newton-Raphson (NR) face significant computational and convergence challenges in modern, large-scale power systems. This paper proposes a novel, two-stage hybrid method that integrates a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a robust, iterative Linear State Estimation (LSE) refinement step to produce fast and physically-consistent solutions. The GNN, trained with a physics-informed loss function featuring an efficient dynamic weighting scheme, rapidly predicts a high-quality initial system state. This prediction is then refined using an iterative, direct linear solver inspired by state estimation techniques. This LSE refinement step solves a series of linear equations to enforce physical laws, effectively bypassing the non-linearities and convergence issues of traditional solvers. The proposed GNN-LSE framework is comprehensively validated on systems ranging from small radial distribution networks (IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus) to a large, meshed transmission system (IEEE 118-bus). Results show that our GNN variants are up to $8.4 \times 10^3$ times faster than NR. The LSE refinement provides a fast route to a physically-consistent solution, while heavy-loading stress tests (120%-150% of nominal) and N-1 contingencies demonstrate the method's reliability and generalization. This work presents a powerful and flexible framework for bridging fast, data-driven models with the rigorous constraints of power system physics, offering a practical tool for real-time operations and analysis.</p>

            <h2>Fair Cost Allocation in Energy Communities: A DLMP-based Bilevel Optimization with a Shapley Value Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongon Park, Kyuhyeong Kwag, Daniel K. Molzahn, Rahul K. Gupta</p>
            <p>Energy communities (ECs) are emerging as a promising decentralized model for managing cooperative distributed energy resources (DERs). As these communities expand and their operations become increasingly integrated into the grid, ensuring fairness in allocating operating costs among participants becomes a challenge. In distribution networks, DER operations at the community level can influence Distribution Locational Marginal Prices (DLMPs), which in turn affect system's operation cost. This interdependence between local decisions and system-level pricing introduces new challenges for fair and transparent cost allocation. Despite growing interest in fairness-aware methods, most methods do not account for the impact of DLMPs. To fill this gap, we propose a bilevel optimization model in which a Community Energy Aggregator (CEA) schedules DERs across multiple ECs while a Distribution System Operator (DSO) determines DLMPs through network-constrained dispatch. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and strong duality, the bilevel model is reformulated into a tractable single-level problem. We achieve fairness in the cost allocation by applying the Shapley value to quantify each community's marginal contribution to system-wide cost savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations on several benchmark distribution systems.</p>

            <p>The integration of converter-interfaced generation introduces new transient stability challenges to modern power systems. Classical Lyapunov- and scalable passivity-based approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions, and finding storage functions for large grids is generally considered intractable. Furthermore, most methods require an accurate grid dynamics model. To address these challenges, we propose a model-free, nonlinear, and dissipativity-based controller which, when applied to grid-connected virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), enhances power system transient stability. Using input-state data, we train neural networks to learn dissipativity-characterizing matrices that yield stabilizing controllers. Furthermore, we incorporate cost function shaping to improve the performance with respect to the user-specified objectives. Numerical results on a modified, all-VSG Kundur two-area power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiushi Wang, Xingpeng Li</p>
            <p>The rapid increase in renewable energy sources (RES) implementation in the power system creates more severe network congestion, which may reduce grid operation efficiency and cause renewable curtailment. Deterministic optimization for the unit commitment shows that battery energy storage system (BESS)-based Virtual Transmission Line (VTL), as an alternative to physical transmission lines, can offer a quick solution for congestion relief, reduced operational costs, and lowered renewable curtailment. This paper aims to evaluate the benefits of VTL when considering Renewable Energy Sources uncertainty. Particularly, this work proposes a scenario-based stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model considering VTL, referred to as SSCUC-VTL. It incorporates the forecast error of RES into the commitment decision for systems with VTL. The performance of applying the VTL strategy is compared to that of adding a new physical transmission line and a standalone BESS. A case study has been conducted on an enhanced IEEE 24-bus test system. The simulation results demonstrate that VTL provides 23% more operational cost reduction than the physical transmission line, and up to 67% more congestion relief than the standalone BESS in a power system with solar and wind generation.</p>

            <p>The intermittent nature of renewable power availability is one of the major sources of uncertainty in power systems. While markets can guarantee that the demand is covered by the available generation, transmission system operators have to often intervene via economic redispatch to ensure that the physical constraints of the network are satisfied. To account for uncertainty, the underlying optimal power flow (OPF) routines have to be modified. Recently, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) has been suggested in the literature as a tool for stochastic OPF problems. However, the usage of PCE-based methods in security-constrained OPF for (N-1)-secure operations has not yet been explored. In this paper, we propose a procedure that iteratively solves a PCE-overloaded stochastic OPF problem by including line outage constraints until an (N-1)-secure solution is achieved. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by comparing it with a Monte-Carlo simulation on a 118-bus example system.</p>

Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.</p>

            <h2>R-SFLLM: Jamming Resilient Framework for Split Federated Learning with Large Language Models</h2>

            <p>Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model's resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.</p>

However, a quantitative answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu) under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture. Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.</p>

            <h2>A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dixon Vimalajeewa, Ursula U. Muller, Brani Vidakovic</p>
            <p>Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying dynamics. We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.</p>

            <h2>A Connectively Stable and Robust DAPI Control Scheme for Islanded Networks of Microgrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahmed Saad Al-Karsani, Maryam Khanbaghi, Aleksandar Zečević</p>
            <p>The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) are giving rise to the emergence of Microgrids (MGs) and Networks of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode. However, they face challenges in terms of secondary level frequency and voltage regulation, due to the variable nature of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and loads. Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control has been proposed in the literature for distributed frequency and voltage control of droop-controlled DERs, but it is not robust to operational or structural perturbations. To address this, we propose a robust DAPI frequency and voltage control scheme that ensures robustness using the concept of connective stability, along with the invariant ellipsoid technique for disturbance rejection. Simulation of an NMG model in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}/Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} consisting of 3 MGs and 5 DERs validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, and demonstrates that it can successfully mitigate the effects of major disturbances such as cyberattacks.</p>

            <h2>Environment-Dependent Components Identification of Behind-the-Meter Resources via Inverse Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengming Lyu, Zhenfei Tan, Xiaoyuan Xu, Chen Fu, Zheng Yan, Mohammad Shahidehpour</p>
            <p>With the increasing penetration of behind-the-meter (BTM) resources, it is vital to monitor the components of these resources and deduce their response behavior to external environment. Owing to data privacy, however, the appliance-wise measurement is invisible to the power system operator, which hinders the accurate modeling of load identification. To this end, this paper proposes a hybrid physics-inspired and data-driven framework for decomposing BTM components based on external measurement of total load and environmental factors. The total load is decomposed into different environment-dependent components, namely storage-like component, PV generation component, thermostatically-controlled load component, and periodic component. The overall load identification adopts a double-layer iterative solution framework. A data-driven inverse optimization algorithm is developed to identify parameters of the energy storage-like component. The physics-inspired model is proposed to identify the capacity and response of the rest components. The modeling accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are validated by numerical tests. The application significance of the proposed BTM identification method is also validated in electricity market clearing for reducing system operation costs.</p>

            <h2>Green Hydrogen under Uncertainty: Evaluating Power-to-X Strategies Using Agent-Based Simulation and Multi-Criteria Decision Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frederik Wagner Madsen, Joy Dalmacio Billanes, Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen, Zheng Ma</p>
            <p>The transition toward net-zero energy systems requires scalable and cost-effective deployment of Power-to-X technologies, particularly green hydrogen production. Despite increasing investments, a critical research gap remains in dynamically assessing how different operational strategies affect the feasibility of hydrogen production under real-world energy market conditions. Most existing studies rely on static, techno-economic models and overlook actor interactions, infrastructure limitations, and regulatory complexity. This paper presents a novel modeling framework that integrates agent-based simulation with multi-criteria decision-making to evaluate green hydrogen production strategies using co-located wind and solar generation. Three operational strategies - grid-only, on-site-only, and hybrid - are applied across three electrolyzer capacity levels (10 MW, 50 MW, and 100 MW) within a Danish case study. Real electricity tariffs, emissions factors, and market data are used to simulate technical, economic, and environmental performance indicators. The results show that hybrid strategies consistently outperform grid-only configurations in terms of cost and emissions while maintaining stable hydrogen output. Although on-site-only strategies minimize emissions and costs, they fail to meet fixed production demands. This framework offers novel scientific contributions by modeling dynamic actor interactions and integrating system performance evaluation into strategic planning. Practically, it provides actionable insights for energy planners and policymakers designing resilient and efficient Power-to-X systems in renewable-rich contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Bin Kwon, Sayak Mukherjee, Veronica Adetola</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</p>

            <h2>Fréchet Power-Scenario Distance: A Metric for Evaluating Generative AI Models across Multiple Time-Scales in Smart Grids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuting Cai, Shaohuai Liu, Chao Tian, Le Xie</p>
            <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fréchet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Changrui Liu, Shengling Shi, Anil Alan, Ganesh Kumar Venayagamoorthy, Bart De Schutter</p>
            <p>Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in practice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammadali Rostami, Saeed Lotfifard, Mladen Kezunovic</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a multi-actor coordination platform for the optimal utilization of smart buildings resources, including roof top PV generation and battery energy storage system (BESS), in active power distribution systems. The proposed multi-actor coordination includes the Smart Building Coordinator (SBC), Micro-Grid Coordinator (MGC) and Distribution System Coordinator (DSC). The coordinators operate independently and only exchange limited information with each other to reach an optimal solution. In the proposed platform, a hierarchical optimization problem is solved to optimally determine the operating point of all distribution system resources. The proposed platform fully preserves the confidentiality of the behind the meter (BTM) data of the buildings since no information about the status of the PV system, BESS, and load of the building is shared with the owner of the power system. The proposed platform has a flexible and scalable architecture where the computational task of coordinating microgrids and smart buildings with distribution grid is performed locally at the MGC and SBC layers, respectively. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed platform in coordinating the BTM resources with the rest of the distribution system.</p>

            <h2>Decentralized Small Gain and Phase Stability Conditions for Grid-Forming Converters: Limitations and Extensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Cifelli, Adolfo Anta</p>
            <p>The increasing share of converter based resources in power systems calls for scalable methods to analyse stability without relying on exhaustive system wide simulations. Decentralized small gain and small-phase criteria have recently been proposed for this purpose, but their applicability to grid forming converters is severely limited by the sectoriality assumption, which is not typically satisfied at low frequencies. This work revisits and extends mixed gain phase conditions by introducing loop shaping transformations that reformulate converter and network models in alternative coordinate frames. The proposed approach resolves intrinsic non sectoriality at low frequencies and reduces conservativeness, thereby improving the applicability of decentralized stability certification. Analytical results are illustrated using an infinite bus system first and then extended to the IEEE 14 bus network, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of the method. These findings provide a pathway toward less conservative and more widely applicable decentralized stability certificates in power grids.</p>

            <h2>Learning Optimal Power Flow with Pointwise Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damian Owerko, Anna Scaglione, Alejandro Ribeiro</p>
            <p>Training learning parameterizations to solve optimal power flow (OPF) with pointwise constraints is proposed. In this novel training approach, a learning parameterization is substituted directly into an OPF problem with constraints required to hold over all problem instances. This is different from existing supervised learning methods in which constraints are required to hold across the average of problem instances. Training with pointwise constraints is undertaken in the dual domain with the use of augmented Lagrangian and dual gradient ascent algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training with pointwise constraints produces solutions with smaller constraint violations. Experiments further demonstrated that pointwise constraints are most effective at reducing constraint violations in corner cases - defined as those realizations in which constraints are most difficult to satisfy. Gains are most pronounced in power systems with large numbers of buses.</p>

            <h2>Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliseo Curcio</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaohong Shi, Eric A. Cator, Jacco Heres, Simon H. Tindemans</p>
            <p>Electrical grid congestion is a growing challenge in Europe, driving the need for accurate prediction of load, particularly of peak load. Non-time-resolved models of peak load offer the advantages of simplicity and compactness, and among them, Velander's formula (VF) is a traditional method that has been used for decades. Moreover, VF can be adapted into a quantile VF, which learns a truncated cumulative distribution function of peak load based on electricity consumption. This paper proposes a mathematical model based on extreme value theory to characterize the probability distribution of peak load for large non-residential customers. The model underpins the quantile VF as demonstrated through multiple quantile regression and reduces its representation to just four parameters without sacrificing predictive performance. Moreover, using maximum likelihood estimation and the likelihood ratio test, we validate that the probability distribution of peak load of analysed groups belongs to the heavy-tailed Fréchet class.</p>

            <p>This paper proposes graph analysis methods to fully automate the fault location identification task in power distribution systems. The proposed methods take basic unordered data from power distribution systems as input, including branch parameters, load values, and the location of measuring devices.

The proposed graph analysis methods do not require complex node and branch numbering processes or renumbering following changes in the system topology. The proposed methods eliminate the need for human intervention at any step of the fault location identification process. They are scalable and applicable to systems of any size. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using the IEEE 34-bus distribution test system.</p>

            <p>Operating fleets of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces several challenges, some of which are borne by the fleet operator, and some of which are borne by the power grid. To maximize short-term profit a fleet operator could always charge EVs at the maximum rate to ensure vehicles are ready to service ride demand. However, due to the stochastic nature of electricity demand, charging EVs at their maximum rate may potentially increase the grid stress and lead to overall instability. Furthermore, high-rate charging of EVs can accelerate battery degradation, thereby reducing the service lifespan of the fleet. This study aims to reconcile the conflicting incentives of fleet longevity, short-term profitability, and grid stability by simulating a taxi fleet throughout its lifespan in relation to its charging policies and service conditions. We develop an EV fleet simulator to evaluate the battery degradation due to unpredictable charging and ride demand. Consequently, the impact on the power grid through the charging infrastructure is assessed due to these activities. This simulation utilizes publicly accessible real-world travel data from the NYC taxi dataset. We compare a baseline 80-20 fleet charging policy with a reinforcement learning-based policy designed to prolong the fleet's service life and alleviate grid stress. We monitor grid stress, battery degradation, and profitability over five years and find that our learned policy outperforms the baseline. This simulator enables fleet operators to assess the impact of different charging policies on these indicators to make informed decisions in the future.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a novel structure-preserving, Kron-based reduction framework for unbalanced distribution feeders. The method aggregates electrically similar nodes within a mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem to produce reduced networks that optimally reproduce the voltage profiles of the original full network. To overcome computational bottlenecks of MIP formulations, we propose an exhaustive-search formulation to identify optimal aggregation decisions while enforcing voltage margin limits. The proposed exhaustive network reduction algorithm is parallelizable on GPUs, which enables scalable network reduction. The resulting reduced networks approximate the full system's voltage profiles with low errors and are suitable for steady-state analysis and optimal power flow studies. The framework is validated on two real utility distribution feeders with 5,991 and 8,381 nodes. The reduced models achieve up to 90% and 80% network reduction, respectively, while the maximum voltage-magnitude error remains below 0.003 p.u. Furthermore, on a 1000-node version of the network, the GPU-accelerated reduction algorithm runs up to 15x faster than its CPU-based counterpart.</p>

            <p>We propose explicitly incorporating large-scale load siting into a stochastic nodal power system capacity expansion planning model that concurrently co-optimizes generation, transmission and storage expansion. The potential operational flexibility of some of these large loads is also taken into account by considering them as consisting of a set of tranches with different reliability requirements, which are modeled as a constraint on expected served energy across operational scenarios. We implement our model as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer optimization problem with cross-scenario expectation constraints. To overcome the challenge of scalability, we build upon existing work to implement this model on a high performance computing platform and exploit scenario parallelization using an augmented Progressive Hedging Algorithm. The algorithm is implemented using the bounding features of mpisppy, which have shown to provide satisfactory provable optimality gaps despite the absence of theoretical guarantees of convergence. We test our approach to assess the value of this proactive planning framework on total system cost and reliability metrics using realistic testcases geographically assigned to San Diego and South Carolina, with datacenter and direct air capture facilities as large loads.</p>

            <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer substantial flexibility for grid services, yet large-scale, uncoordinated charging can threaten voltage stability in distribution networks. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for smart charging often disregard physical grid constraints or have limited performance for complex large-scale tasks, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. This paper introduces a physics-informed (PI) RL algorithm that integrates a differentiable power flow model and voltage-based reward design into the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, enabling EVs to deliver real-time voltage support while meeting user demands. The resulting PI-TD3 algorithm achieves faster convergence, improved sample efficiency, and reliable voltage magnitude regulation under uncertain and overloaded conditions. Benchmarks on the IEEE 34-bus and 123-bus networks show that the proposed PI-TD3 outperforms both model-free RL and optimization-based baselines in grid constraint management, user satisfaction, and economic metrics, even as the system scales to hundreds of EVs. These advances enable robust, scalable, and practical EV charging strategies that enhance grid resilience and support distribution networks operation.</p>

            <p>Off-grid renewable power to ammonia (ReP2A) systems present a promising pathway toward carbon neutrality in both the energy and chemical industries. However, due to chemical safety requirements, the limited flexibility of ammonia synthesis poses a challenge when attempting to align with the variable hydrogen flow produced from renewable power. This necessitates the optimal sizing of equipment capacity for effective and coordinated production across the system. Additionally, an ReP2A system may involve multiple stakeholders with varying degrees of operational flexibility, complicating the planning problem. This paper first examines the multistakeholder sizing equilibrium (MSSE) of the ReP2A system. First, we propose an MSSE model that accounts for individual planning decisions and the competing economic interests of the stakeholders of power generation, hydrogen production, and ammonia synthesis. We then construct an equivalent optimization problem based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the equilibrium. Following this, we decompose the problem in the temporal dimension and solve it via multicut generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to address long-term balancing issues. Case studies based on a realistic project reveal that the equilibrium does not naturally balance the interests of all stakeholders due to their heterogeneous characteristics. Our findings suggest that benefit transfer or re-arrangement ensure mutual benefits and the successful implementation of ReP2A projects.</p>

            <h2>Machine Learning-Based Performance Evaluation of a Solar-Powered Hydrogen Fuel Cell Hybrid in a Radio-Controlled Electric Vehicle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amirhesam Aghanouri, Mohamed Sabry, Joshua Cherian Varughese, Cristina Olaverri-Monreal</p>
            <p>This paper presents an experimental investigation and performance evaluation of a hybrid electric radio-controlled car powered by a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery combined with a renewable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell system. The study evaluates the performance of the system under various load-carrying scenarios and varying environmental conditions, simulating real-world operating conditions including throttle operation. In order to build a predictive model, gather operational insights, and detect anomalies, data-driven analyses using signal processing and modern machine learning techniques were employed. Specifically, machine learning techniques were used to distinguish throttle levels with high precision based on the operational data. Anomaly and change point detection methods enhanced voltage stability, resulting in fewer critical faults in the hybrid system compared to battery-only operation. Temporal Convolutional Networks were effectively employed to predict voltage behavior, demonstrating potential for use in planning the locations of fueling or charging stations. Moreover, integration with a solar-powered electrolyzer confirmed the system's potential for off-grid, renewable hydrogen use. The results indicate that integrating a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell with Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries significantly improves electrical performance and reliability for small electric vehicles, and these findings can be a potential baseline for scaling up to larger vehicles.</p>

            <h2>Carbon-Aware Orchestration of Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks via Digital Twin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shumaila Javaid, Nasir Saeed</p>
            <p>Integrated Satellite Aerial Terrestrial Networks (ISATNs) are envisioned as key enablers of 6G, providing global connectivity for applications such as autonomous transportation, Industrial IoT, and disaster response. Their large-scale deployment, however, risks unsustainable energy use and carbon emissions. This work advances prior energy-aware studies by proposing a carbon-aware orchestration framework for ISATNs that leverages Digital Twin (DT) technology. The framework adopts grams of CO$_2$-equivalent per bit (gCO$_2$/bit) as a primary sustainability metric and implements a multi timescale Plan Do Check Act (PDCA) loop that combines day-ahead forecasting with real-time adaptive optimization. ISATN-specific control knobs, including carbon-aware handovers, UAV duty cycling, and renewable-aware edge placement, are exploited to reduce emissions. Simulation results with real carbon intensity data show up to 29\% lower gCO$_2$/bit than QoS-only orchestration, while improving renewable utilization and resilience under adverse events.</p>

            <h2>DRL-Based Resource Allocation for Energy-Efficient IRS-Assisted UAV Spectrum Sharing Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiheng Wang</p>
            <p>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems provide a new paradigm for reconfigurable and flexible wireless communications. To enable more energy efficient and spectrum efficient IRS assisted UAV wireless communications, this paper introduces a novel IRS-assisted UAV enabled spectrum sharing system with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The goal is to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the secondary network by jointly optimizing the beamforming, subcarrier allocation, IRS phase shifts, and the UAV trajectory subject to practical transmit power and passive reflection constraints as well as UAV physical limitations. A physically grounded propulsion-energy model is adopted, with its tight upper bound used to form a tractable EE lower bound for the spectrum sharing system. To handle highly non convex, time coupled optimization problems with a mixed continuous and discrete policy space, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on the actor critic framework. Extended experiments show the significant EE improvement of the proposed DRL-based approach compared to several benchmark schemes, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach with mobility.</p>

            <p>Thyristor rectifiers (TRs) are cost-effective power supplies for hydrogen electrolyzers (ELZs) but introduce harmonic distortion that may violate grid codes. This letter proposes a self-governing harmonic mitigation strategy through coordinated operation of multiple ELZs in large power-to-hydrogen (P2H) plants. First, the harmonic model of TR-powered ELZs is derived, revealing a natural harmonic cancellation mechanism among them. Based on this, a system-level operation scheme based on phasor modulation is developed and integrated into plant scheduling. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method reduces harmonic currents by 21.2%-39.7% and ensures grid-code compliance, with only a 0.25% loss in hydrogen output, while increasing total revenue by over 21\% compared to production-oriented strategies.</p>

            <h2>A Flow-Based Model for Conditional and Probabilistic Electricity Consumption Profile Generation and Prediction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijie Xia, Chenguang Wang, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara</p>
            <p>Residential Load Profile (RLP) generation and prediction are critical for the operation and planning of distribution networks, especially as diverse low-carbon technologies (e.g., photovoltaic and electric vehicles) are increasingly adopted. This paper introduces a novel flow-based generative model, termed Full Convolutional Profile Flow (FCPFlow), which is uniquely designed for both conditional and unconditional RLP generation, and for probabilistic load forecasting. By introducing two new layers--the invertible linear layer and the invertible normalization layer--the proposed FCPFlow architecture shows three main advantages compared to traditional statistical and contemporary deep generative models: 1) it is well-suited for RLP generation under continuous conditions, such as varying weather and annual electricity consumption, 2) it demonstrates superior scalability in different datasets compared to traditional statistical models, and 3) it also demonstrates better modeling capabilities in capturing the complex correlation of RLPs compared with deep generative models.</p>

            <h2>PowerChain: A Verifiable Agentic AI System for Automating Distribution Grid Analyses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel O. Badmus, Peng Sang, Dimitrios Stamoulis, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carsten Andrich, Isabella Varga, Tobias F. Nowack, Alexander Ihlow, Sebastian Giehl, Michael Schubert, Reiner S. Thomä, Matthias A. Hein</p>
            <p>Bistatic radar measurements offer unique spatial diversity and enhanced target characterization capabilities, rendering them increasingly vital for contemporary sensing application research. The reliability of such measurements is contingent upon precise system and antenna calibration. The prevailing technique is the substitution method, which involves the use of known reference objects. We propose an over-the-air calibration algorithm for spherical bistatic measurement systems. Our method is both significantly simpler and twice as fast as existing algorithms. The application of our technique to reflectivity measurements of a metal sphere from 76 to 81 GHz demonstrates a dynamic range enhancement of up to 40 dB when compared with uncalibrated data. A comparison with simulation data demonstrates a high degree of agreement between measurement and simulation.</p>

            <h2>AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Hamza Ali, Amritanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.</p>

            <h2>Supervisory Control of Hybrid Power Plants Using Online Feedback Optimization: Designs and Validations with a Hybrid Co-Simulation Engine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Mukherjee, Himanshu Sharma, Wenceslao Shaw Cortez, Genevieve Starke, Michael Sinner, Brooke J. Stanislawski, Zachary Tully, Paul Fleming, Sonja Glavaski</p>
            <p>This research investigates designing a supervisory feedback controller for a hybrid power plant that coordinates the wind, solar, and battery energy storage plants to meet the desired power demands. We have explored an online feedback control design that does not require detailed knowledge about the models, known as feedback optimization. The control inputs are updated using the gradient information of the cost and the outputs with respect to the input control commands. This enables us to adjust the active power references of wind, solar, and storage plants to meet the power generation requirements set by grid operators. The methodology also ensures robust control performance in the presence of uncertainties in the weather. In this paper, we focus on describing the supervisory feedback optimization formulation and control-oriented modeling for individual renewable and storage components of the hybrid power plant. The proposed supervisory control has been integrated with the hybrid plant co-simulation engine, Hercules, demonstrating its effectiveness in more realistic simulation scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Real-time Measurement-based Optimization for Distribution System Operation Considering Battery Voltage and Thermal Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sen Zhan, Lingkang Jin, Haoyang Zhang, Nikolaos G. Paterakis</p>
            <p>The secure operation of power distribution systems is challenged by the growing integration of distributed energy resources. Leveraging the flexibility of battery storage offers a cost-effective alternative to measures like generation curtailment, which results in energy losses. However, developing an effective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid models, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power injections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex electrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in distribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are constructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage measurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation, enabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational complexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery storage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring secure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal constraints of battery storage.</p>

            <h2>Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Power Systems by Implicit Multilinear Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christoph Kaufmann, Georg Pangalos, Gerwald Lichtenberg, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt</p>
            <p>This paper proposes a new approach to perform small-signal stability analysis based on linearization of implicit multilinear models. Multilinear models describe the system dynamics by multilinear functions of state, input, and algebraic variables. Using suitable transformations of variables, they can also represent trigonometric functions, which often occur in power systems modeling. This allows tensor representations of grid-following and grid-forming power converters. This paper introduces small-signal stability analysis of equilibrium points based on implicit multilinear models using generalized eigenvalues. The generalized eigenvalues are computed from linear descriptor models of the linearized implicit multilinear model. The proposed approach is tested using a 3-bus network example, first by comparing time-domain simulations of the implicit multilinear model with those of the nonlinear model, and second by comparing the generalized eigenvalues with those of the linearized nonlinear model. The results show that the decomposed tensor representation of the implicit multilinear model allows for a faster linearization compared to conventional methods in MATLAB Simulink.</p>

            <h2>Differentiating Through Power Flow Solutions for Admittance and Topology Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Talkington, Daniel Turizo, Sergio A. Dorado-Rojas, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn</p>
            <p>The power flow equations relate bus voltage phasors to power injections via the network admittance matrix. These equations are central to the key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation, protection, and fault location, among others). As control, optimization, and estimation of network admittance parameters are central to multiple avenues of research in electric power systems, we propose a linearization of power flow solutions obtained by implicitly differentiating them with respect to the network admittance parameters. This is achieved by utilizing the implicit function theorem, in which we show that such a differentiation is guaranteed to exist under mild conditions and is applicable to generic power systems (radial or meshed). The proposed theory is applied to derive sensitivities of complex voltages, line currents, and power flows. The developed theory of linearizing the power flow equations around changes in the complex network admittance parameters has numerous applications. We demonstrate several of these applications, such as predicting the nodal voltages when the network topology changes without solving the power flow equations. We showcase the application for continuous admittance control, which is used to increase the hosting capacity of a given distribution network.</p>

            <h2>Data-driven Communication and Control Design for Distributed Frequency Regulation with Black-box Inverters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Nestor, Jiaxin Wang, Ning Zhang, Fei Teng</p>
            <p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources into the power grid, with often only black-box models available, challenges long-standing frequency control methods. Most recent works take a decentralized approach without online device coordination via communication. This paper considers both dynamic behavior and communication within secondary frequency control on an intermediate timescale. We develop a distributed data-driven approach that utilizes peer-to-peer communication between inverters to avoid the need for a central control center. To enable a trade off between communication network requirements and control performance, we present a framework to guide communication topology design for secondary frequency regulation. Following design of the inter-agent information exchange scheme, we design a controller that is structured according to the communication topology with a closed-loop stability guarantee. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the framework and illustrate the trade-off between communication requirements and control performance that is enabled by our approach.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution for Virtual Power Plant Communication: A Lightweight Key-Aware Scheduler with Provable Stability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>Virtual power plants (VPPs) are becoming a cornerstone of future grids, aggregating distributed PV, wind, storage, and flexible loads for market participation and real-time balancing. As operations move to minute-- and second--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to an operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly determine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time. Conventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain, high-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key yield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This paper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum keys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i) forecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware deficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and (iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled down-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis establishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with quantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable operating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus VPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with industry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and static-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and passive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and enhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.</p>

            <h2>The impact of large-scale EV charging on the real-time operation of distribution systems: A comprehensive review</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Yu, Chuang Yang, Qin Wang</p>
            <p>With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.</p>

            <p>This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust speech processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>The rapid decentralization and digitalization of local electricity markets have introduced new cyber-physical vulnerabilities, including key leakage, data tampering, and identity spoofing. Existing blockchain-based solutions provide transparency and traceability but still depend on classical cryptographic primitives that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Q-EnergyDEX, a zero-trust distributed energy trading framework driven by quantum key distribution and blockchain. The framework integrates physical-layer quantum randomness with market-level operations, providing an end-to-end quantum-secured infrastructure. A cloud-based Quantum Key Management Service continuously generates verifiable entropy and regulates key generation through a rate-adaptive algorithm to sustain high-quality randomness. A symmetric authentication protocol (Q-SAH) establishes secure and low-latency sessions, while the quantum-aided consensus mechanism (PoR-Lite) achieves probabilistic ledger finality within a few seconds. Furthermore, a Stackelberg-constrained bilateral auction couples market clearing with entropy availability, ensuring both economic efficiency and cryptographic security. Simulation results show that Q-EnergyDEX maintains robust key stability and near-optimal social welfare, demonstrating its feasibility for large-scale decentralized energy markets.</p>

            <h2>Sparsity-exploiting Gaussian Process for Robust Transient Learning of Power System Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tina Gao, Shimiao Li, Lawrence Pileggi</p>
            <p>Advances in leveraging Gaussian processes (GP) have enabled learning and inferring dynamic grid behavior from scarce PMU measurements. However, real measurements can be corrupted by various random and targeted threats, leading to inaccurate and meaningless results. This paper develops robust transient learning to overcome this challenge by exploiting the sparse corruption patterns in the data flow. Specifically, we integrate sparse optimization with method of moments (MoM) to make learning robust to a sparse distribution of data corruptions; then, we optimize sparse weights to identify corrupted meter locations. To improve inference speed on large-scale systems, we further adopt K-medoid clustering of locations to develop dimension reduction (DR) and aggregate representation (AR) heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate robustness against random large errors, targeted false data injections, and local PMU clock drifts. On a 1354-bus system, inference turns out to be 18x faster using DR and 400x faster when further combined with AR heuristics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand-side flexibility has made virtual power plants (VPPs) central to modern grid operation. Yet their end-to-end business pipeline, covering bidding, dispatch, metering, settlement, and archival, forms a tightly coupled cyber-physical-economic system where secure and timely communication is critical. Under the combined stress of sophisticated cyberattacks and extreme weather shocks, conventional cryptography offers limited long-term protection. Quantum key distribution (QKD), with information-theoretic guarantees, is viewed as a gold standard for securing critical infrastructures. However, limited key generation rates, routing capacity, and system overhead render key allocation a pressing challenge: scarce quantum keys must be scheduled across heterogeneous processes to minimize residual risk while maintaining latency guarantees. This paper introduces a quantum-authenticated aggregation and settlement framework for VPPs. We first develop a system-threat model that connects QKD key generation and routing with business-layer security strategies, authentication strength, refresh frequency, and delay constraints. Building on this, we formulate a key-budgeted risk minimization problem that jointly accounts for economic risk, service-level violations, and key-budget feasibility, and reveal a threshold property linking marginal security value to shadow prices. Case studies on a representative VPP system demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces residual risk and SLA violations, enhances key efficiency and robustness, and aligns observed dynamics with the theoretical shadow price mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Techno-Economic Feasibility Analysis of Quantum Key Distribution for Power-System Communications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziqing Zhu</p>
            <p>The accelerating digitalization and decentralization of modern power systems expose critical communication infrastructures to escalating cyber risks, particularly under emerging quantum computing threats. This paper presents an integrated techno-economic framework to evaluate the feasibility of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure power-system communications. A stochastic system model is developed to jointly capture time-varying key demand, QKD supply under optical-loss constraints, station-side buffering, and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) fallback mechanisms. Analytical conditions are derived for service-level assurance, including buffer stability, outage probability, and availability bounds. Building on this, two quantitative metrics, including the Levelized Cost of Security (LCoSec) and Cost of Incremental Security (CIS), are formulated to unify capital, operational, and risk-related expenditures within a discounted net-present-value framework. Using IEEE 118-bus, 123-node, and 39-bus test systems, we conduct discrete-event simulations comparing PQC-only, QKD-only, and Hybrid architectures across multiple topologies and service profiles. Results show that Hybrid architectures dominated by QKD significantly reduce key-outage probability and SLA shortfalls, achieving near-unit availability for real-time and confidentiality-critical services. Economic analyses reveal clear breakeven zones where QKD-enhanced deployments become cost-effective, primarily in metropolitan and distribution-level networks under moderate optical loss and buffer sizing. The proposed framework provides a reproducible, risk-aware decision tool for guiding large-scale, economically justified QKD adoption in future resilient power-system infrastructures.</p>

            <h2>Modeling and Dynamic Simulation of a Hybrid Wind-Wave System on a Hexagonal Semi-Submersible Platform</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Bayat, Jerry Zuo, Jing Sun</p>
            <p>Offshore renewable energy systems offer promising solutions for sustainable power generation, yet most existing platforms harvest either wind or wave energy in isolation. This study presents a hybrid floating offshore platform that integrates a wind turbine with three oscillating surge wave energy converters (WECs) into a hexagonal semi-submersible structure. In this configuration, the flaps are integrated with the platform geometry to provide both energy extraction and hydrodynamic stability. A modeling and simulation framework was developed using WEC-Sim and benchmarked against the NREL 5 MW semisubmersible reference. Metacentric height analysis confirmed hydrostatic stability across a range of prescribed flap angles. Sensitivity analysis of twelve geometric variables identified flap dimensions and tower length as dominant drivers of stability, energy capture, and tower stress. Time-domain simulations revealed dependence on wave incidence angle, with variations in flap power sharing, capture width ratio (CWR), and platform response. The feasibility of using flap sweeps to modulate pitch motion was also demonstrated. Annual energy production (AEP) estimates based on site-specific data indicate 16.86 GWh from wind and 3.65 GWh from wave energy, with WECs contributing about 18% of the total. These results highlight the potential of integrated wind-wave platforms and point toward future studies on structural modeling and advanced control.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a predictive control strategy to manage low-voltage distribution systems. The proposed approach relies on an aggregate of the flexibility at the residential unit level into a three-dimensional chart that represents the injected active and reactive power, and the flexibility cost. First, this method solves a multiparametric optimization problem offline at the residential unit level to aggregate the flexibility of the assets. Then, a semi-explicit model predictive control problem is solved to account for forecasts. By combining the results of these problems with measurements, the method generates the desired flexibility chart. The proposed approach is compatible with realtime control requirements, as heavy computations are performed offline locally, making it naturally parallelizable. By linking realtime flexibility assessment with energy scheduling, our approach enables efficient, low-cost, and privacy-preserving management of low-voltage distribution systems. We validate this method on a low-voltage network of 5 buses by comparing it with an ideal technique.</p>

The Irish and UK governments announced their commitments to offshore wind capacities - 37 and 125 GW, respectively, in 2050, more than two times higher than their projected power demands. While other continental countries, such as Germany, are calling for cleaner fuel resources. Exporting surplus offshore green hydrogen and bridging supply and demand could be pivotal in carbon emission mitigation for Europe. Yet, the potentials of these Island countries, are usually underestimated. This paper developed a bottom-up method to investigate the role of offshore hydrogen from Ireland and the UK in the decarbonisation of the entire Europe. We evaluate the future hydrogen/ammonia trading and the contributions of each country in carbon emission mitigation, considering their relative cost-competitiveness in offshore hydrogen production, domestic hourly power and gas system operation, and international shipping costs. Results indicate that the offshore green hydrogen could reduce 175.16 Mt/year of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. The UK will be the largest hydrogen supplier from 2030 to 2040, while surpassed by Ireland in 2050, with 161 TWh of hydrogen exports to France and Spain. The offshore green hydrogen can contribute to 175.16 Mt of annual carbon dioxide emission reductions in total. This general flow of hydrogen from the West to the East not only facilitates Europe's net-zero progress, but also reshapes the energy supply structure and helps to ensure energy security across the European continent.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Geon Roh, Jip Kim</p>
            <p>Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked, despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by 84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO. Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.</p>
